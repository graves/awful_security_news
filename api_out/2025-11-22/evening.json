It wasn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Just moments earlier, the 28-year-old had been marveling at the sweep of a bald eagle overhead as she traveled toward Cherokee along a highway skirting the Great Smoky Mountains National Park,  CNN affiliate WLOS  reported. The majestic bird was an unexpected sight — and then, suddenly, a troubling one.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not used to seeing them there, and I was like ‘Wow, that’s amazing,’” Schlarb told  WLOS . “I realized it had something with it. Once I realized it was a cat that it had, it barely had a hold on it, it dropped it right on my windshield. It sounded like a bomb went off.”\n \n\n   \n  The cat was already dead by the time it ended up in her car, she said. Whether the massive bird released the animal from its talons deliberately or simply lost its grip is unclear, but the impact was catastrophic.\n \n\n   \n  “I could see the cat in my passenger seat. I have guts all over me, there’s glass everywhere,” Schlarb said. A driver who had been traveling behind her pulled over immediately, telling her he watched the entire surreal sequence unfold and helping guide her off US Highway 74.\n \n\n   \n  Shaken and covered in blood, Schlarb called 911 and delivered a report that sounded like it came from a disaster movie.\n \n\n   \n  “You may not believe me, but I just had a bald eagle drop a cat through my windshield,” the incredulous driver said on the recorded 911 call. “It absolutely shattered my windshield.”\n \n\n   \n  The dispatcher, impressively calm in the face of chaos, let out a laugh.\n \n\n   \n  “OK. I do believe you, honestly,” the dispatcher said in a recording  obtained by The Associated Press . “Oh my goodness. Let’s see. I’ve heard crazier.”\n \n\n   \n  Kendrick Weeks, Western Wildlife Diversity Program supervisor for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, told the AP the cat may have been roadkill scavenged by the eagle.\n \n\n   \n  “But they can take animals the size of a cat,” Weeks said. “It is much harder for them to take a live cat than a dead cat. They usually don’t prey on something they don’t find palatable. And, scavenging is a common behavior in bald eagles.”\n \n\n   \n  Raptors such as eagles can lose or release their prey for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the bird simply doesn’t have a secure hold, and other times the prey is struggling so violently, the raptor lets go to avoid being injured, according to Weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Prey may also slip away if another bird harasses the raptor mid-flight or if the load becomes too heavy to carry any farther.\n \n\n   \n   Bald eagles  are listed as a threatened species and are native to North Carolina and much of the continent, according to the  North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. \n \n\n   \n  Their population has been steadily rebounding in the state, with more than 200 nesting pairs now living there, according to Weeks. The birds typically weigh between roughly 6 1/2 to 13 1/2 pounds and can span 6 to 7 feet from wingtip to wingtip, Weeks told the AP.\n \n\n   \n  Though still rattled, Schlarb says she’s thankful the surreal encounter caused no injuries, apart from the poor cat’s demise.\n \n\n   \n  “I just thank God that it wasn’t a different scenario,” she said. “Even a shift a little bit more in my direction, that could have landed in my face. It could have been a completely different story. I may not even be here at this point.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-resign-in-january","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"GOP Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene will leave Congress after five turbulent years \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Kaitlan Collins, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:01 PM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she will resign from office in January, stunning some in her own party after a shocking, monthslong political pivot that catapulted her from one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies to one of his top antagonists.\n \n\n   \n  Greene dropped the news in a  post on social media  just days after her  public falling-out  with Trump, who called her a “traitor” and said he’d support a GOP challenge to her House seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  In her statement, Greene said she wanted to avoid a nasty primary — while predicting that the GOP would lose its House majority in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “I have too much self-respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms,” Greene said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump again called Greene a “traitor” on Truth Social on Saturday morning after her announcement, saying she dropped out because of “PLUMMETING Poll Numbers” and his threat to support a primary challenger against her.\n \n\n   \n  “For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD. Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said later Saturday that he was open to reconciliation with Greene, telling reporters, “Sure, why not? I mean, I get along with everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘Go your own way,’ and once I left her, she resigned,” Trump said. “She would never have survived the primary, but I think she’s a nice person.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision to step down will cap a turbulent five-year career in Washington, during which Greene was publicly condemned for violent rhetoric on the House floor and  booted  from the hard-right Freedom Caucus over a feud with a fellow Republican — while wielding extraordinary influence in her party as one of Trump’s most trusted political allies on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since Trump’s initial “traitor” comments, Greene faced direct threats against her life, the congresswoman  said in an interview with CNN . In the same interview, the conservative firebrand apologized for her own years of “toxic” rhetoric — comments that reverberated around the country amid an increasingly violent political culture.\n \n\n   \n  Greene had been contemplating her resignation for over a week, according to a person close to her, as the threats against her continued to escalate amid her falling-out with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Her next steps remain unclear. But the Georgia congresswoman, who just months earlier had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state’s high-stakes Senate race, currently has no plans to run for office, the person added.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Greene criticized the president for being too focused on foreign policy and not doing enough with his domestic agenda — going as far as to side with Democrats over the contentious issue of costly enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire next month.\n \n\n   \n  Greene also became one of the White House’s most vocal critics of the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. She and fellow Republican Rep. Thomas Massie accused the White House of attempting to conceal details of the files. Following fierce resistance, Trump ultimately signed an Epstein transparency measure into law earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very sad for our country but so happy for my friend Marjorie. I’ll miss her tremendously. She embodies what a true Representative should be,” Massie wrote on X, shortly after Greene’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s exit is likely to be quickly felt in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must navigate a razor-thin majority. The Republican leader already faces the tall order in the new year of corralling his fractious conference to move on major legislation and further the president’s priorities.\n \n\n   \n  First elected in 2020, the Georgia congresswoman was known for vocally touting conspiracy theories and for her incendiary rhetoric, including prior remarks endorsing violence against Democrats in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Her first year in office, a Democratic-led House under then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the extraordinary step of  stripping Greene of her committee assignments  because of her past rhetoric endorsing violence and claims the deadly Sandy Hook and Parkland school shootings had been staged.\n \n\n   \n  In a sign of Greene’s recent political turnaround, the Georgia congresswoman praised Pelosi’s leadership in an interview with CNN, saying of the longtime Democrat, “She had an incredible career for her party. … I served under her speakership in my first term of Congress, and I’m very impressed at her ability to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Christian Sierra and Julia Benbrook contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/americas/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-arrested-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"17:05:00Z","title":"Brazil’s ex-president Bolsonaro arrested to prevent ‘attempted escape,’ court says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was arrested on November 22, 2025, by Brazilian police under a preventive detention order from the Supreme Court, following a vigil organized by his son Flávio Bolsonaro.

Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former Brazilian President  Jair Bolsonaro  was arrested on Saturday by police to prevent a possible “attempted escape,” according to Brazil’s Supreme Court, days before he was due to begin a prison sentence for leading a coup attempt.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro was arrested at his home in Brasília and taken into police custody. In a statement, Federal Police said it executed a preventive arrest warrant that had been requested by the police themselves and authorized by the Supreme Court, CNN affiliate CNN Brasil reported.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN Brasil that a vigil organized by Bolsonaro’s oldest son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, in front of the complex of residential buildings where the former president lives triggered the request for preventive detention.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro’s lawyers vowed to appeal the arrest and dismissed the claim that the former president was attempting to escape.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s Supreme Court said Saturday it had received information about the “summoning of supporters” to the vigil, which indicated a “high possibility of an attempted escape,” adding that there was a violation of Bolsonaro’s electronic monitoring equipment in the early hours of the morning.\n \n\n   \n  “The information confirms the convict’s intention to break the electronic ankle bracelet in order to ensure the success of his escape, facilitated by the confusion caused by the demonstration,” the court said.\n \n\n   \n  Flávio Bolsonaro described the vigil, initially planned for Saturday evening local time, as an opportunity to pray for his father following  recent reports of ill health  and “for the return of democracy in our country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Are you going to fight for your country or just watch everything on your phone on your couch at home?” he asked his followers in a social media video.\n \n\n   \n    Tampered ankle monitor\n \n\n   \n  Later on Saturday, the Supreme Court released  a video , which  it says  shows Bolsonaro admitting to tampering with his ankle monitor with a soldering iron.\n \n\n   \n  Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Bolsonaro’s defense team to explain the ankle monitor tampering within 24 hours, according to an order released by the court on Saturday alongside the video.\n \n\n   \n  In the video, a penal official examines the partially melted casing and questions Bolsonaro about it. “Did you use anything to burn this here?” asks Rita Gaio, deputy director of Brazil’s Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Hot iron,” Bolsonaro is heard replying. He said he used a soldering iron out of “curiosity,” and had not attempted to remove or damage the bracelet fastening the device to his ankle.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro’s attorney told Brazilian media that the issue of the former president’s ankle monitor is beside the point, arguing that Bolsonaro would not have been able to escape his home since he was under armed guard.\n \n\n   \n  “The issue of the ankle monitor is an attempt to justify the unjustifiable,” Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Paulo Cunha Bueno, told reporters on Saturday. “President Bolsonaro would have no way of leaving his house. He has an armed patrol car 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So there would be no way for him to leave his home.” CNN has reached out to Bueno for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Flávio Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to a CNN Brasil request for comment. In an earlier statement, Jair Bolsonaro’s lawyers pushed back against the claim that he was attempting to escape, according to CNN Brasil.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is that the former President was arrested at his home, with an electronic ankle monitor and under police surveillance,” his lawyers said in a statement. “Furthermore, Jair Bolsonaro’s health is delicate and his imprisonment may put his life at risk.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawyers added that the right to assembly is protected in law, referring to the planned vigil.\n \n\n   \n  Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced earlier this year to 27 years in prison for plotting to remain in power after losing the 2022 election to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and has been under house arrest. Four out of five justices on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel voted to convict Bolsonaro on all five counts in the landmark case.\n \n\n   \n  As well as plotting a coup d’état, Bolsonaro was convicted of taking part in an armed criminal organization, attempting to abolish Brazil’s democratic order by force, committing violent acts against state institutions and damaging protected public property during the  storming of government buildings  by his supporters on January 8, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro has long insisted that the trial amounted to a political witch hunt.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, high-ranking military officials and a federal police officer were also sentenced to prison terms after a panel of Brazilian Supreme Court justices found them guilty of attempting a coup and plotting to kill Lula da Silva.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, reporters asked US President Donald Trump if he had heard of Bolsonaro’s arrest. Trump, a Bolsonaro ally who raised tariffs on Brazil to 50% as punishment for the former president’s trial, said that he had not heard, but that it was “too bad.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently backtracked and  carved out  tariff exceptions for some of Brazil’s biggest exports, namely coffee and beef.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones and Michael Rios contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/us/rhode-island-intern-detained-ice","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"19:07:00-05:00","title":"High School Intern Mistakenly Detained by ICE at Rhode Island Courthouse","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 16-year-old high school intern was mistakenly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as he was being driven to school by a judge at the Rhode Island Superior Court.

the  Los Angeles Fire Department . An explosion shook the vessel shortly before 8 p.m., knocking out power to lights and cranes,  LAFD  said.\n \n\n   \n     A spokesperson with the LAFD said the cargo ship has since been moved. Capt. Erik Scott told CNN Saturday the ship was escorted beyond the Vincent Thomas Bridge around 3 a.m. local time.\n \n\n   \n  No injuries were reported, and all 23 crew members had been evacuated from the ship, authorities  said .\n \n\n   \n  The  Port of Los Angeles , which describes itself as North America’s busiest, earlier said four of its seven container terminals suspended operations Friday night and a safety zone was established around the ship. Port operations resumed Saturday morning, according to a news  release .\n \n\n   \n  “Many of our fire boats are out there. They are trying to cool down this vessel,” fire department Capt. Adam Van Gerpen said at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Several cargo containers involved in the blaze carry hazardous materials, requiring firefighters to wear protective suits and oxygen masks, Van Gerpen said. Air quality was being monitored as crews worked overnight to suppress the blaze in the ship’s lower levels.\n \n\n   \n  At 11 p.m. Friday, the  LAFD  ordered all firefighters off the deck. By midnight,  authorities  had advised residents in San Pedro and Wilmington to shelter in place.

  \n  New Yorkers know better than to be overly positive.\n \n\n   \n  A day after Zohran Mamdani got a  surprisingly warm reception  at the White House from President Donald Trump, who has spent the last few months deriding the New York City mayor-elect as a “lunatic” and falsely labeling him a communist, New Yorkers told CNN they were cautiously optimistic and slightly impressed.\n \n\n   \n  “I really don’t like the guy, but I’m glad that he was able to go in there and do a good job with the president,” John Lani told CNN Saturday following a mid-morning run in Central Park. “Maybe we’ll get some funding, we won’t shut down congestion pricing. Maybe we’ll get some stuff for the subway, we’ll see what it does for the state.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist who previously served three terms in the New York State Assembly, cruised to victory earlier this month, winning every borough in the city except for Staten Island, a known Republican enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Near Central Park, along the bustle of one of Manhattan’s most congested intersections, New Yorkers praised Mamdani’s handling of his televised press engagement with the president, even if they remain skeptical about how he will ultimately perform once he takes office on January 1.\n \n\n   \n  Voter data analysis  published  by The Center for Urban Research at CUNY’s Graduate Center shows the area near Central Park, home to Columbus Circle and the Trump International Hotel, favored former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran against Mamdani as an independent.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope everyone’s very successful. I didn’t support either party,” said a voter who did not want to share their name.\n \n\n   \n    Meeting could prove to have high stakes\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Mamdani’s relationship will prove pivotal for several key issues in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  There is the question of whether Trump will ramp up immigration enforcement and deploy federal forces, like  he has  in some  other blue cities . There are major infrastructure projects that depend on federal funding, and the vast majority of Mamdani’s proposals — like making city buses fast and free, providing free universal childcare and raising taxes on the wealthy — will depend on funding from the state, which is also dependent on federal funds.\n \n\n   \n  After watching news coverage of the meeting, Sherry and Steve Cohen, who live in Manhattan, said they wanted to give Mamdani a chance.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to think that Mamdani is being smart enough to play Trump and praise the man because he needs things for New York,” Steve Cohen said. “Unfortunately, this is what you have to do. You have to bow down, praise him, and walk out and wash your hands after.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who grew up in Queens and made his name and fortune in Manhattan ,  remains focused on New York City despite his  lack of popularity  there.   Trump, who conceded Friday he would have loved to be mayor of his hometown, struck an agreeable tone, saying he wanted to help the city instead of hurt it.   \n \n\n   \n  Already, there were signs that Mamdani’s approach might be working, at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested Saturday New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, other places need it more,” Trump told reporters. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Shelly Payson, who is supportive of Mamdani ,  said she thought Mamdani had a strategy going into the meeting that worked.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that Trump continues to be the most transactional president we’ve ever had, and if people are smart they find a way to give him something which may be meaningless, but it’s important to him and then he loves you and rolls out the red carpet,” Payson said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/europe/europe-ukraine-trump-peace-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00Z","title":"Ukraine’s allies voice concern over US peace plan ahead of talks Sunday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"World leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, European officials such as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and the Nordic-Baltic Eight, have voiced significant concern over a proposed US 28-point peace plan for Ukraine.

The US has long considered him a criminal, accusing him of heading a criminal structure known as “el Cartel de los Soles” (the Cartel of the Suns), which most experts say does not technically exist.\n \n\n   \n  Recently, the Trump administration  labeled el Cartel de los Soles a terrorist group , creating a potential opening for US military strikes in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To make matters worse for the embattled president, his political enemy, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado,  won the Nobel Peace Prize  in October. From hiding, Machado has warned that Maduro’s time as president is coming to an end,  promising a “new era” for Venezuela .\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to experts about what might lie in store for the Chavista leader, all of whom agreed that Maduro and his government are extremely unlikely to forfeit power willingly.\n \n\n   \n  Elias Ferrer, a Caracas-based risk consultant at Orinoco Research, said that Maduro and his colleagues are keenly aware that leaving power without a guarantee of immunity may result in prison time or extradition to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is one of the few countries in the world that if you mess with them, they can chase you until the end of the world,” said Ferrer. “They are facing a very real danger.”   \n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez promised that her   country would “not surrender” in a speech on Thursday at a cultural event in Caracas. \n \n\n   \n  “What Venezuela is experiencing today, I would not call dangerous times, no, but rather times of historic definition, of historic insurgency, so that they know that this people will not surrender, this people cannot be blackmailed,” Rodriguez said.\n \n\n   \n  David Smilde, a Venezuela expert and professor at Tulane University, told CNN that many observers underestimate how committed Maduro and his circle are to Chavismo, the socialist movement named after Hugo Chavez and the state’s guiding ideology.\n \n\n   \n  “They are worried about their safety, and they are worried about their wealth,” Smilde said. “But they also think of themselves as revolutionaries, as an anti-imperialist, historically important project that has thumbed its nose at the United States, thumbed its nose at Venezuela’s dominant political class and has done their own thing now for 25 years.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that for Maduro to accept any kind of transition,” Smilde continued, “There would have to be some sort of path for Chavismo to be a viable political force, for there not to be a witch hunt for Chavistas afterwards.”\n \n\n   \n    Off-ramp for Maduro\n \n\n   \n  Brian Fonseca, professor at Florida International University, said that a satisfactory “off-ramp” for Maduro might be  exile in Russia , but not without pressure from within his own inner circle.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there has to be enough pressure mounted within the political or the military elite that ultimately push him out. I don’t think he’s going to go willfully,” Fonseca said.\n \n\n   \n  On the other hand, Ferrer told CNN that he doesn’t see Maduro or his circle accepting exile.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think they want to go into exile in Russia or Cuba or anything like that,” Ferrer said. “They want essentially something very pragmatic, where Maduro and his friends can still be the economic elite of the country, and can trust whoever’s in charge of the armed forces.”\n \n\n   \n    Hold the champagne\n \n\n   \n  Smilde cautioned against any hopes that the eventual end of Maduro’s presidency would signify the end of the regime.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of his lack of charisma, what he’s had to do is construct this pyramid of people that are benefiting in some way,” Smilde said. “If you just take Maduro off of that pyramid, the pyramid is still there – and there’s a lot of people with a lot of interest in things continuing on the way they are.”\n \n\n   \n  The professor recalled when Hugo Chavez  died in 2013 , many wrongly assumed that his political project had come to an end.\n \n\n   \n  “I was getting on a plane to Caracas,” Smilde said. “I was walking through first class. There were all these Venezuelans sipping champagne, hugging each other, saying ‘it’s over, Chavez is dead.’ And so here we are. Nothing actually changed. That leader left, and then you had a leader that’s worse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/politics/tatiana-schlossberg-terminal-cancer-kennedy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"12:50:00.000-05:00","title":"Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, reveals terminal cancer diagnosis","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former President John F.

agree to a roadmap away from fossil fuels after contentious, chaotic summit \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, Andrew Freedman, Ella Nilsen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:27 PM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The world struck a new climate deal at the  COP30 summit  in Brazil Saturday, which calls for a tripling of funding to help countries adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts. But countries failed to agree to a roadmap  away from fossil fuels , after entrenched divisions threatened to collapse the talks.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement came after more than two weeks of increasingly fraught negotiations between representatives of more than 190 countries in  the port city of Belém , known as the gateway to the Amazon. Disagreements reached such fever pitch there were fears the summit would collapse with no deal. Talks stretched overtime as dozens of nations pushed back against an outcome that didn’t explicitly mention a transition away from oil, coal and gas — the drivers of the climate crisis.\n \n\n   \n  But just after midday local time Saturday, the COP30 president André Corrêa do Lago gaveled through a deal.\n \n\n   \n  The final text contained no mention of fossil fuels, signaling a retreat from consensus agreements only two years old. It included only a general agreement on deforestation, rather than more explicit commitments, which had been another key issue in the negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  More than 80 countries, including Colombia, the UK and France, supported the concept of a “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, building on a commitment made at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. However, intense opposition from petrostates — including Saudi Arabia and Russia — and other heavy fossil fuels users prevented consensus.\n \n\n   \n  As part of reaching the deal, Corrêa do Lago instead said the COP presidency in Brazil would produce side texts detailing a global roadmap for moving away from fossil fuels and addressing deforestation that not all countries signed off on.\n \n\n   \n  This unorthodox move was intended to demonstrate that all countries’ issues were heard at the summit, and allow COP to potentially build off the language in future negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  After the agreement was gaveled through, multiple developing countries spoke out against it, including Colombia, which formally objected to the lack of inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels.\n \n\n   \n  There was some progress at COP30. Wealthier countries agreed to work toward tripling the money available to help climate-vulnerable countries adapt to the ravages of global warming — a potential goal of $120 billion a year by 2035, to come out of the  $300 billion pot of funding  they agreed to at last year’s COP.\n \n\n   \n  The summit deal also included an agreement to a plan for a “just transition” — the idea that as the world moves away from fossil fuels, workers in these industries must not be left behind but instead are helped into cleaner jobs. However, this included no specific funding.\n \n\n   \n  There was also disappointment from some that more was not done to strengthen countries’ national climate plans, which set out how much climate pollution they’ll cut over the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  An analysis of these plans by the UN found that collectively they would only achieve around a 12% reduction in planet-heating pollution, far below the 60% needed for any chance of keeping alive the internationally agreed target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n \n\n   \n  This is “the first COP at which the prospect of surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming has now become acknowledged,” said Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.\n \n\n   \n  The reaction from global climate experts to the final agreement was mixed.\n \n\n   \n  This summit was in many ways seen as a test of multilateralism, especially as the US was absent from the process, with the Trump administration declining to send a delegation. For some experts, the fact an agreement was reached at all shows global climate diplomacy is still alive.\n \n\n   \n  A decade after the landmark Paris agreement, the Brazil summit proved the process “is working,” said former German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan.\n \n\n   \n  “While far from what’s needed, the outcome in Belém is meaningful progress,” Morgan said in a statement. “Despite the efforts of major oil producing states to slow down the green transition, multilateralism continues to support the interests of the whole world in tackling the climate crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  Sierra Leone’s minister of environment and climate change Jiwoh Abdulai said this year’s summit had “moved the needle” in terms of richer, developed nations accepting more financial responsibility to help the rest of the world adapt to climate change.\n \n\n   \n  But where some saw cautious forward progress, others identified a much darker trend. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama’s special representative for climate change. “A ‘Forest COP’ with no commitment on forests is a very bad joke. A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence.”\n \n\n   \n  Harjeet Singh, COP veteran and founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, agreed. “The hypocrisy of the Global North has been laid bare,” he said. “They offer us endless new ‘dialogues’ that cannot pay for adaptation or rebuild homes destroyed by climate disasters.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/business/telegraph-daily-mail-buyer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"12:33:00-05:00","title":"Daily Mail owner strikes $650 million deal to buy the Telegraph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Daily Mail Group (DMGT) has finalized a £500 million ($650 million) acquisition of The Telegraph, forming one of the most powerful right-leaning media groups in the UK.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Daily Mail owner DMGT said on Saturday it had struck a 500 million pound ($650 million) deal to buy rival newspaper The Telegraph in a tie-up that would create one of the most powerful right-leaning media groups in Britain.\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes a week after US-based private investment firm RedBird Capital Partners  withdrew  its bid for The Telegraph, one of Britain’s biggest newspapers.\n \n\n   \n  A RedBird-IMI joint venture had acquired the Telegraph Media Group and The Spectator magazine in 2023, only for the then-government to intervene and ban foreign state investment in UK newspapers. RedBird then sought to formally request approval from the government to proceed with the acquisition under a revised structure, with Abu Dhabi-backed IMI participating as a minority investor capped at 15%.\n \n\n   \n  A source close to RedBird told Reuters that the regulatory clearance process had been slower than expected, contributing to doubts about the timeline and feasibility of the acquisition. Sustained internal opposition from senior figures within the Telegraph newsroom had prompted it to walk away.\n \n\n   \n  The Financial Times, which first  reported  the DMGT deal, said the price had been set at about 500 million pounds to repay the money spent by the RedBird-fronted consortium.\n \n\n   \n  The parties have entered a period of exclusivity to finalize the terms of the transaction and to prepare the necessary regulatory submissions, which they expect to happen quickly, DMGT said in a statement. The transaction would comply with the UK’s Foreign State Influence regime as there will be no foreign state investment or capital in the funding structure, the statement added.\n \n\n   \n  DMGT had registered an interest in potentially bidding for The Telegraph Media Group in 2023. Sky News  reported  in May this year that DMGT was in talks to buy a 9.9% stake in the Telegraph titles.\n \n\n   \n  DMGT’s stable of media brands also includes The Mail on Sunday, Metro, The i Paper, and New Scientist. The Daily Telegraph would remain editorially independent from other titles in the group.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for RedBird IMI said: “DMGT and RedBird IMI have worked swiftly to reach the agreement announced today, which will shortly be submitted to the Secretary of State.”\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/africa/g20-south-africa-us-boycott-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"09:06:00+00:00","title":"G20 Summit in South Africa Adopts Climate Declaration Despite US Boycott, Opposition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite the United States' boycott and opposition to climate-focused language, the G20 summit in South Africa successfully adopted a declaration emphasizing climate change, renewable energy, and debt relief for developing nations.

November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  A Group of 20 leaders’ summit in  South Africa  adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges on Saturday after it was drafted without US input in a move a White House official called “shameful.”\n \n\n   \n  The declaration, using language to which Washington has been opposed, “can’t be renegotiated,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told reporters, reflecting strains between Pretoria and the Trump administration over the event.\n \n\n   \n  “We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Ramaphosa, host of this weekend’s gathering of Group of 20 leaders in Johannesburg, had earlier said there was “overwhelming consensus” for a summit declaration.\n \n\n   \n    Declaration mentions climate change\n \n\n   \n  Envoys from the G20 - which brings together the world’s major economies – drew up a draft leaders’ declaration on Friday without US involvement, four sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  The declaration used the kind of language long disliked by the Trump administration: stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it, praising ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noting the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.\n \n\n   \n  The mention of climate change was a snub to US President  Donald Trump,  who doubts the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. US officials had indicated they would oppose any reference to it in the declaration.\n \n\n   \n  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa said: “There’s been overwhelming consensus and agreement that one of the other tasks we should undertake right at the beginning is to … adopt our declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  “We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His bold tone was a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during his  visit to the White House  in August, in which he endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa, brushing aside Ramaphosa’s efforts to correct his facts.\n \n\n   \n   Trump  said US officials would not attend the summit because of allegations, widely discredited, that the host country’s Black majority government persecutes its white minority.\n \n\n   \n    Trump rejects South Africa’s G20 agenda\n \n\n   \n  The US president has also  rejected  the host nation’s agenda of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs.\n \n\n   \n  “The multilateral platform cannot be paralyzed on the basis of the absence of someone who was invited,” South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC.\n \n\n   \n  “This G20 is not about the US. It’s about all the 21 members of the G20. We are all equal members of the G20. What it means is that we need to take a decision. Those of us who are here have decided this is where the world must go.”\n \n\n   \n  But in a sign of the many geopolitical fissures underlying the agreed text, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about the “the weaponisation of dependencies” which she said “only creates losers.”\n \n\n   \n  This was an apparent veiled reference to China’s export curbs on rare earths vital for the world’s energy transition, as well as defense and digital technology.\n \n\n   \n  The United States will host the G20 in 2026 and Ramaphosa said he would have to hand over the rotating presidency to an “empty chair.”\n \n\n   \n  The South African presidency on Saturday reiterated its rejection of a US offer to send the US charge d’affaires for the G20 handover.\n \n\n   \n  “The president will not hand over to a junior embassy official the presidency of the G20. It’s a breach of protocol that is not going to be accommodated,” presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said.\n \n\n   \n  “America chose to boycott the summit.

His statements to officers, they said, were made voluntarily and before he was taken into police custody.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense’s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione’s rights are respected at trial.\n \n\n   \n  “What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”\n \n\n   \n  Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges.\n \n\n   \n  In September, a judge threw out state terrorism charges against him but kept the rest of that case — including an intentional murder charge — in place.

Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n \n\n   \n  Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later while eating breakfast at a McDonald’s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles west of Manhattan.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment is warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”\n \n\n   \n  The defense argued in a September court filing that Bondi’s announcement — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi’s statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration’s flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione’s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first term, has also offered opinions about Mangione despite court rules against any pretrial publicity that could interfere with the right to a fair trial.\n \n\n   \n  “He shot someone in the back, as clear as you’re looking at me or I’m looking at you. He shot — he looked like a pure assassin,” Trump told Fox News in September.\n \n\n   \n  In their Friday filing, federal prosecutors countered that Bondi’s remarks were irrelevant to the process because there’s no evidence that grand jurors who voted to indict Mangione were influenced.\n \n\n   \n  “This argument, like others, rests on conjecture rather than evidence,” the prosecution team said.\n \n\n   \n  Nor has the defense cited any precedent “suggesting that public commentary renders a grand jury incapable of fulfilling its constitutional role,” they added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/us/new-jersey-sport-betting-lucchese-crime-family","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-04:00","title":"New Jersey Sports Betting Case Shows How Mob Allegedly Used an Old School Scheme to Target Gen Z Gamblers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent law enforcement case in New Jersey, the Lucchese crime family, led by Joseph M.

That scheme did not specifically target young people.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the common thread was accused organized crime members using their muscle to run illegal rackets despite the availability of legalized enterprises – sports betting or card games. But the New Jersey case in particular illustrates how the illegal market leveraged a pipeline that has grown out of  legalized sports betting , funneling nascent gamblers to nefarious actors.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin told CNN the operation shows the mob continues to provide a “smoky back room” for illegal activity, though today it “may look a little different.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now it may be on your cellphone,” he said. “But it’s still there.”\n \n\n   \n  While experts say legalized sports betting does not necessarily share the same customer base as an illegal bookkeeper, the latter will always be enticing to some – even if La Cosa Nostra is not what it once was.\n \n\n   \n  “Organized crime will always exist by claiming that they’re going to give a better shake in this than regular, tax-paying suckers,” said CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always going to be this romanticized notion that somehow this is a victimless crime, and that you’re just dealing with the neighborhood guys.”\n \n\n   \n   “Or in this case,” he added, “the guys from the dorm.”\n \n\n   \n    How the operation allegedly worked\n \n\n   \n  In announcing the charges, New Jersey officials did not lay out specifics of how the purported scheme worked, telling reporters the investigation remained ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  But it was a multimillion-dollar operation, Platkin’s office said, with approximately $2 million in suspected gambling transactions transferred between 2022 and 2024. That figure was for peer-to-peer transactions that investigators were able to trace, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Investigators are still trying to figure out how many cash transactions were made in person and how much money was exchanged, a figure that is expected to drive the $2 million figure much higher, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Platkin told reporters the alleged operation “used offshore gambling websites to systematically entice people to place bets … all in an effort to line” the pockets of the accused ringleader and his associates.\n \n\n   \n  The enterprise was directed by Joseph M. Perna, a member of the Lucchese crime family, according to a probable cause affidavit.   \n \n\n   \n  It was a family affair, with one of Perna’s sons accused of running the day-to-day, overseeing a group of subordinate agents including student-athletes who ran their own sportsbooks, the affidavit said.\n \n\n   \n  Those sportsbooks were run on mobile applications that helped the defendants set up and organize their gambling ring, the official said. This allowed them to give their victims a far more targeted experience in sports and categories not provided by the major online gaming platforms, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  “This operation relied on Gen Z gamblers, and a network of sub agents recruited from among Perna’s sons’ high school and college friends,” Platkin said.\n \n\n   \n  “They effectively recruited younger gamblers or players that they knew would be able to pay up,” said Platkin, “or those that they could leverage payment from – namely college students and student-athletes.”\n \n\n   \n  Perna was charged along with his sons, nephews and others with racketeering, conspiracy, gambling offenses and money laundering, Platkin said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Perna’s attorney for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Perna made a virtual court appearance Tuesday, according to online court records which show his next hearing is January 2. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said Perna did not enter a plea.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney general used the case as a cautionary tale to young gamblers.\n \n\n   \n  “At a time when we’ve legalized sports betting, when we’ve made it regulated, or we care about responsible gaming … the organized crime families, the mob, are continuing to find new ways to try to profit off of illegal activities involving our younger residents,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More charges are possible, as well as more arrests, as the investigation expands, according to the official. More college students – some of whom are also college athletes – at dozens of colleges and universities are said to be embroiled in the scheme, the official said. Investigators are combing through cellphones and other pieces of digital evidence to see how far the scheme went – even to see if any coaches are also involved, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The case shows how mobsters are trying to target young people that not only can afford to pay off their debts, but ones who also want to keep their gambling a secret from school administrators or authority figures, the official said.\n \n\n   \n    Mafia’s footprint is a far cry from its heyday, experts say\n \n\n   \n  Legalized sports betting has become a “feeder for illegal bookmaking,” according to Ronald Goldstock, the former head of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, which was vital to securing convictions against high profile members of the mob.\n \n\n   \n  “People who wouldn’t have gone to a bookmaker are now betting legally,” said Goldstock. “They get attached to it. They get addicted to it.”\n \n\n   \n  “And then at some point where they’re betting more money, they realize that it’s crazy to bet online,” said Goldstock, who spearheaded the unit vital to securing convictions of high-profile members of organized crime. “You want to bet with a bookmaker, so you don’t pay taxes on winnings.”\n \n\n   \n  The charged operation in New Jersey was initially sniffed out by the the Port Investigations Unit of the New Jersey State Police Port Security Section, an agency tasked with keeping organized crime out of the waterfronts – a notoriously problematic endeavor that prompted the creation in 1953 of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor.\n \n\n   \n  Goldstock, who in the 1980s bugged the Jaguar used to chauffeur the Lucchese crime family boss, said the recent crackdowns seemed to target mobsters acting on their own, rather than endeavors run at the direction of their families. That’s an indicator, Goldstock said, that the mafia’s footprint is a far cry from what it used to be, despite its recent activities.\n \n\n   \n  “They controlled the construction industry, the carting industry, the garment center, the fish market, the street festivals in Little Italy, the Javits Center. But now, none of that,” Goldstock said. “They don’t control any unions, they don’t control any industries. They’re not making huge amounts of money the way they used to, except for the Waterfront.”\n \n\n   \n  But its dwindling presence aside, the mob has never quite been rooted out.\n \n\n   \n  Membership in organized crime is still somewhat high but modern-day mobsters have learned from the past, avoiding grizzly and public homicides as a way to stay out of law enforcement’s spotlight, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation official, who requested anonymity to protect their current investigations. One such public homicide was the murder of Paul Castellano outside a midtown Manhattan steakhouse ordered by John Gotti in 1985.\n \n\n   \n  The main sources of revenue continue to be illegal gambling and loan sharking, the FBI official said.\n \n\n   \n  “The thing about the mob is, every time you declare them dead, it’s like that final scene in the horror movie,” Miller said, “where they put the monster in the grave, and as the credits start to roll, the hand comes up from out of the dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are not what they used to be,” he added. “But they are also not gone, because there are people who work very hard, ironically, to make sure that they never work that hard and believe that a life of crime as a profession is some kind of honorable life. And they don’t want to give it up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/tech/ai-bubble-fears-nvidia-earnings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-05:00","title":"The world’s biggest company just told everyone to chill out","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia reported record-breaking sales and profits, with year-on-year growth of over 60%, reinforcing its position as a leader in AI technology.

to chill out \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Concerns about an AI bubble have been simmering for  at least a year and a half.  Nvidia’s incredibly strong earnings this past week tried to put those fears to bed. It may not have been enough.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia on Wednesday  posted sales and profits  up more than 60% year-on-year, stronger than Wall Street had projected. CEO Jensen Huang said “sales are off the charts.” And the company expects fourth quarter revenue of around $65 billion, once again ahead of Wall Street’s projections.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia executives said these results, along with growth from other major AI players and the  billions being poured into AI infrastructure , indicate that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Huang said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street analysts agree.   But the wider market is not yet convinced: After briefly ticking up on Thursday morning following Nvidia’s report, the chipmaker’s shares ( NVDA ) dipped back into the red. They closed Friday down 1%, although the stock remains up 29% from the start of this year.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, Nvidia answered a lot of questions about where the industry stands right now, but it may take more to shift the overall AI narrative.\n \n\n   \n    Not to burst your bubble\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company anticipates $3 trillion to $4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, adding that demand “continues to exceed our expectations.” Already, tech giants are expected to pour $400 billion into AI-related capital expenditures this year, to meet what they say is growing demand for AI and cloud services but also to avoid falling behind industry rivals.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia has every reason to try to reassure investors — expectations for the company are sky-high after nearly two years of astronomical growth. And many look to the chipmaker as a bellwether for the overall tech industry.\n \n\n   \n  Even as Silicon Valley tries to figure out the business model for generative AI, Nvidia has a big role to fill in the existing tech services people use every day, Huang said. That could help insulate Nvidia even if returns from new AI applications are smaller than expected or take longer to arrive than planned.\n \n\n   \n  “The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in cloud computing spend each year.” Much of the infrastructure powering that software has transitioned from running on older CPU chips to Nvidia’s GPUs, the chips known for running AI tools, Huang said.\n \n\n   \n  Kress also took the unusual step of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads.” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year. And Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia isn’t the only one arguing that AI bubble concerns may be exaggerated.\n \n\n   \n  “The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble…instead its Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in emailed commentary.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar, said he doesn’t “see many signs to suggest that 2026 will be a weak year for Nvidia in any way” and sees the bubble fears weighing on the company’s stock as a “buying opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears remain\n \n\n   \n  But despite those strong results, it appears the stock market may not be ready to relax just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Questions remain about whether tech firms will maintain their massive spending on AI infrastructure, especially as  Nvidia has invested in  key, unprofitable customers such as OpenAI and Anthropic. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar also  raised alarms  earlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are incurring to build AI infrastructure. Some took her comments as a sign OpenAI may struggle to afford its commitments, although the company later tried to walk back the statement.\n \n\n   \n  And while Nvidia likely has enough customers even if a bubble burst causes some casualties among AI firms, investors may still be worried about what a downturn or even a slowdown could mean for the larger market.\n \n\n   \n  Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, said questions about the sustainability of Big Tech’s infrastructure spending spree and Nvidia’s circular funding deals were not “put to rest” with its latest report. Instead, they may just be “punted” to the next quarter.\n \n\n   \n  That means Nvidia almost certainly has more work ahead to convince the world that we’re in for an AI boom and not bust.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/africa/students-kidnapped-nigerian-catholic-school-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"06:02:00-05:00","title":"Armed bandits kidnap more than 300 students from Catholic school in Nigeria","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Armed bandits kidnapped over 300 students and 12 teachers from St. Mary’s Catholic School in Niger State, Nigeria, in a mass abduction that follows a series of similar attacks in neighboring states.

in Nigeria \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, Hira Humayun, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:02 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Armed bandits kidnapped more than 300 students at a private Catholic school in Nigeria’s north-central Niger State, authorities say, the latest in a spate of mass abductions and attacks that have drawn the attention of the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Despite some students managing to get to safety during Friday’s attack, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said 303 students and 12 teachers were abducted in the raid, updating an earlier figure of 215 students. Some are as young as ten.\n \n\n   \n  The figure was updated after a final census was carried out, according to CAN’s Niger State chapter chairman Most. Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who visited St. Mary’s School on Friday to meet with the parents of the abducted children.\n \n\n   \n  Yohanna said the additional 88 students “were also captured after they tried to escape” during the attack, adding that the students were both male and female and aged between ten to 18 years old, Yohanna’s spokesman Daniel Atori told CNN on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities announced some federal and state-run schools in northern Nigeria have temporarily closed following Friday’s abduction to forestall further attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The abduction in Niger state, which borders Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, follows a similar  attack on a church  by gunmen in neighboring Kwara State earlier in the week. During the church attack, at least two people were killed, and several worshippers, including the pastor, were abducted.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, this week, armed men  kidnapped 25 female students  when they stormed a government girls’ boarding school in northwestern Kebbi State. The school’s vice principal was shot and killed during this attack.\n \n\n   \n  Nigerian content creator Eze Gloria Chidinma, whose younger sister is a student at the school and managed to escape during the abduction, told the Associated Press she thinks the authorities “are not doing enough” to curb cases of school abductions.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s traumatic,” she said, “I really do not believe in the authorities, to be very honest.” Chidinma’s mother and elder brother were also kidnapped in a separate incident last year.\n \n\n   \n  The Niger State government  condemned  the latest attack on St. Mary’s School, while local police issued a statement Friday indicating that security forces have deployed to the area and are “combing the forests” in an effort to rescue the abducted students.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria is facing a wave of attacks by armed groups that target vulnerable civilian populations and orchestrate mass abductions for ransom. The country is also plagued by religiously motivated attacks and other violent conflicts stemming from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has frequently expressed outrage over disputed allegations of a  “mass slaughter” of Christians  by Islamist insurgents in Nigeria and has threatened military action to protect this religious group.\n \n\n   \n   Earlier this month , Trump designated Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US  International Religious Freedom Act , suggesting that his administration has determined Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  But the  reality on the ground  is more complex and nuanced. Experts and analysts say both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in Africa’s most populous country — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists. In August, Reuters reported  at least 50 worshippers were killed  — some shot, others burned alive — when gunmen attacked a mosque in the north-western Katsina State.\n \n\n   \n  Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development told CNN: “Yes, these (extremist) groups have sadly killed many Christians. However, they have also massacred tens of thousands of Muslims.”\n \n\n   \n  The recent string of attacks coincides with the arrival of a Nigerian delegation in Washington for discussions with US government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of War Pete Hegseth posted on  social media  he met with Nigeria’s National Security Advisor Mallam Nuhu Ribadu on Thursday “to discuss the horrific violence against Christians in their country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Under [Trump’s] leadership, [the Department of War] is working aggressively with Nigeria to end the persecution of Christians by jihadist terrorists,” Hegseth added.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.

where planes zoom above your head \n       \n  By Maureen O'Hare, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Our pre-Thanksgiving travel news roundup is all about transportation, from flight attendants’ holiday survival tips to Egypt’s new high-speed rail and how the world’s oldest passenger ship began a new life on land.\n \n\n   \n    A unique airport and a unique plane\n \n\n   \n  Maho Beach, on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, is a paradise for plane fans and thrill-seekers. The landing strip at Princess Juliana International Airport is separated from the beach by a single road, meaning that at peak season up to 70 flights a day come whizzing over the sand,  almost close enough to touch .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary,” says airport worker Franklin Wilson. “It feels like it’s coming straight at you.”\n \n\n   \n  For many pilots, however, it’s a dream come true, says Wilson’s colleague Irving Maduro. “They love seeing the people on the beach below them.”\n \n\n   \n  There will be plenty of time for window-gazing on Qantas Airways’ new passenger jet, which has been designed to fly nonstop for up to 22 hours. The Australian airline released the  first images  of the plane this month, which will fly direct from Sydney to London and New York.\n \n\n   \n    High-speed rail projects\n \n\n   \n  The US government shutdown has ended, but it could take months for air travel to  fully recover . Wouldn’t it be nice if Americans had an attractive alternative, such as a joined-up network of high-speed rail?\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reimagined three of the busiest flight and road trip routes across the US mainland as high-speed rail lines — offering a vision of a faster, better, more connected future.  Explore our interactive  to find out more.\n \n\n   \n  Egypt unveiled new  155-miles-per-hour trains  this month, 41 of which will be used on the nation’s planned 2,000-kilometer (1,200-mile), high-speed network. It won’t be the continent’s first. Africa’s first high-speed line, which connects Tangier and Casablanca at speeds up to 200 miles per hour, opened in Morocco in 2018.\n \n\n   \n    Holiday survival tips\n \n\n   \n  Thanksgiving travel is stressful every year, but the 2025 edition definitely has the potential to be extra jitter-inducing. We asked flight attendants to share their secrets to  surviving holiday travel , from booking directly with the airline to why you should always wipe down surfaces.\n \n\n   \n  And CNN’s Pete Muntean went behind the scenes of Southwest Airlines’ network operations control, where they monitor every flight in real time.\n \n\n   \n  On the busiest days of the Thanksgiving rush, up to 600,000 people a day will be in the air, but airline COO Andrew Watterson isn’t expecting drama. He says, “The weather is good and we’re properly staffed.”  Watch here .\n \n\n   \n  If you do run into trouble this year, though, we have some explainers on what to do if your  flight is canceled  or your  luggage  is lost, delayed, stolen or damaged.\n \n\n   \n    Epic voyages\n \n\n   \n  Of course, there are more challenging journeys than a delayed short-haul flight back to mom’s place.\n \n\n   \n  Couple Torin and Paige Rouse, for example, are  walking 12,000 miles  through all 50 US states. They spoke to CNN about the support they have been finding among strangers.\n \n\n   \n  “We were expecting to sleep under a lot more bridges,” says Torin, but “people were coming out of the woodwork to help us along the way.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Stephanie Halasz  swam from Asia to Europe  this August as part of the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Race in Istanbul. More than 2,800 swimmers signed up to take on the four-mile course this year, facing challenges including strong currents and jellyfish.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, two British women recently rowed 8,000 miles across the Pacific to raise money for charity. They’re Miriam Payne and the aptly named Jess Rowe.  Watch here  to see what it was like living on a rowboat for five months.\n \n\n   \n    New life for an old passenger ship\n \n\n   \n  The world’s oldest passenger ship, the SS Medina, made its maiden voyage back in 1914. Now, thanks to an $18-million investment from a Singaporean businessman, it has a new life on land as a hotel. CNN took a tour.\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n   Someone was able to bring a  meat cleaver  onto a plane in Portland.  \n \n\n   \n  TSA is investigating how it got past security.\n \n\n   \n   An immigration crackdown. A lavish state visit.

 7:00 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Garry McFadden, a charismatic and opinionated detective-turned-TV personality, was elected sheriff of North Carolina’s Mecklenburg County years ago after  promising  that he’d limit the jail’s cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  But this month, agents with ICE’s sister agency, Customs and Border Protection, marched into Charlotte and other parts of his county without meeting with him, arresting  more than 350 people  in an  immigration crackdown  the Trump administration dubbed “ Operation Charlotte’s Web ” – a move that some say the sheriff invited with his previous tussles with ICE.\n \n\n   \n  The move came even after recent state laws forced the sheriff – who had ended a formal cooperation agreement with ICE as promised – into more of a working relationship with the agency.\n \n\n   \n  CBP  ended its operation  in Charlotte this week, but McFadden, whose jurisdiction is limited to the county jail and court system, remains a central figure in Charlotte’s immigration debate. The sheriff said his requests to meet with the CBP officials involved in the operation were unfulfilled.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think you can make someplace safer when you are in fear … of deportation,” he said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” on Monday. “We would have liked to have (a) conversation with Border Patrol while they’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  His stance on cooperation with immigration authorities is just part of what makes him known in the area. He’s earned recognition as a Charlotte police detective who  solved hundreds of homicides , and has just  announced  a run for a third term as sheriff after months of  calling   out  immigration enforcement tactics and fielding allegations of a toxic workplace.\n \n\n   \n    From homicides, to TV, to sheriff\n \n\n   \n  Originally from Sumter, South Carolina, McFadden made a name for himself in his 36 years with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, becoming a detective who would have one of the highest murder solve rates in the department’s history, his office  says .\n \n\n   \n  He led the  Cops and Barbers  program, aimed at bridging a communication gap between officers and the community, which received national recognition, including by former  President Barack Obama’s administration .\n \n\n   \n  In the last couple years as a Charlotte detective, McFadden starred in the 2016-17 reality show “ I am Homicide ,” made by Investigation Discovery (now part of CNN’s parent company, WarnerBros Discovery). He’s also made appearances on  other national shows .\n \n\n   \n  “In Charlotte, North Carolina, many know him as Homicide. His real name is Detective Garry McFadden, and he seeks justice for the deceased by using his charisma to sniff out clues and hunt down leads,”  a description  of the show reads.\n \n\n   \n  McFadden parlayed that publicity into a 2018 bid for the county sheriff’s office, which presides over Mecklenburg’s jail and court system, partially on  a promise  to curb the agency’s cooperation with ICE.\n \n\n   \n  McFadden said stopping the 287(g) program, which allows ICE to delegate some immigration activity to local authorities, would help people from immigrant communities feel more comfortable in reporting crime, The Charlotte Observer  reported that year .\n \n\n   \n  After he won and took office in December 2018, he kept his word,  stopping  deputies’ participation in  287(g).  In the jail, that program encouraged deputies to alert the feds about inmates suspected of being in the US illegally. McFadden also  declined to honor ICE detainers  – requests for local law enforcement to hold people in their custody beyond their ordinary release time, allowing federal agents to pick them up.\n \n\n   \n    Relationship with ICE and changes to law\n \n\n   \n  ICE took notice. In 2020, it launched billboards in Charlotte featuring people it said were in the US illegally, previously convicted of crimes and released rather than being transferred to ICE custody. In a news release, the agency  mentioned  the jail’s refusal to honor detainers, and said the billboards aimed to “educate the public about the dangers of non-cooperation policies.”\n \n\n   \n  The introduction of  two  state  laws  in the last couple of years expanded the cooperation mandated between sheriff’s offices and ICE officials, including requirements for jail administrators to check inmates’ immigration status, honor ICE detainers and notify the agency in advance of releasing someone who is held on a detainer.\n \n\n   \n  McFadden emphasized that while his office would adhere to the law, it would  not participate  in actual enforcement measures with ICE.\n \n\n   \n  McFadden  said  he sat down with ICE’s regional representatives last month to discuss their working relationship – a meeting he described as productive. The sheriff criticized Customs and Border Protection for making no attempt to have a similar conversation with him before or during its operation.\n \n\n   \n  “We are all law enforcement. At least respect me enough to come and have a conversation with me while you’re operating in my county,” he said on CNN Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security did not name McFadden when  announcing  its Charlotte operation, but  some  Republican officials have suggested the sheriff is responsible for the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Border Patrol is in Charlotte because Sheriff McFadden refused to do his job. His sanctuary policies blocked hundreds of ICE detainers and pushed criminal illegal aliens right back onto the streets,” the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Destin Hall,  said on X Monday .\n \n\n   \n  A number of factors could have led to the deployment, including Charlotte’s growing immigrant population, immigration court and large ICE field office, Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network,  told  CNN. The move could also be seen as retaliation for the sheriff’s previous decision to curb collaboration with ICE, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement about the operation , DHS said it was standing up for North Carolinians “who live in fear because of violent criminal illegal aliens,” arresting those with “extensive immigration and criminal histories, including domestic violence, assault, breaking and entering, larceny, and driving while intoxicated.”\n \n\n   \n  US Rep.  Alma Adams  of North Carolina, a Democrat, decried the deployment, saying that the presence of CBP and ICE officials “threatens the wellbeing of the communities they enter.”\n \n\n   \n  The surge in CBP agents in the county has left residents in a state of “fear, anxiety and uncertainty,” McFadden told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone’s asking me, ‘When are they going to leave?’ And I told them I did not have that answer, because I have not talked to anyone from Border Patrol,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also caused some people to retreat from daily life, he added, noting that his officers told him many students from predominantly Black and Latino areas did not attend school on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  More than 30,000 students, about 20% of enrollment, were absent across 185 Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools Monday, the district  said .\n \n\n   \n  Business owners also say that employees are not showing up for work amid the increased immigration enforcement in the area, McFadden said.\n \n\n   \n    Community relations\n \n\n   \n  McFadden came onto the scene as a first-time sheriff in 2018, but quickly gained a profile on the national level, Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the National Sheriff’s Association, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s, in many ways, larger than life. But he’s also one of these people that you know when he says something, you can go to the bank on it,” Thompson said.\n \n\n   \n  McFadden approached the organization after his election and went through its training program for first-time sheriffs, Thompson said. He now sits on the board.\n \n\n   \n  “The best way to take a command and leadership role in this organization is to speak out and to be active, and he has become very, very active and sought a spot on the board, and he has become one of our go-to people,” Thompson said.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson said he’s never watched McFadden’s show, but he’s visited his agency and jail many times.\n \n\n   \n  “As we say, he’s a cop’s cop, and believes in the rule of law, believes in the cooperation of law enforcement between one another and amongst one another as agencies,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about McFadden’s expectation that CBP should have communicated with his office about its operation in Charlotte, Thompson said law enforcement partners need to be able to trust each other “to maintain operational security.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think he’s got a rightful bone to pick here, which is, ‘Hey, if you’re coming into our jurisdiction, you need to come visit with me and my command staff,’” Thompson said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his recognition as a leader at the national level, McFadden is seen by some as a divisive figure locally, especially when it comes to his stance on immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve never had a working relationship with Sheriff McFadden,” Daniel Redford, who heads the union representing local police officers, told CNN. He described McFadden as “self-serving.”\n \n\n   \n  “It always has seemed that he has found a way to kind of buck the system in enforcing immigration,” Redford said.\n \n\n   \n  Redford wrote a  letter  on behalf of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #9, last month requesting federal aid and National Guard deployment due partly to police staffing shortages.\n \n\n   \n  He said it’s the first time his lodge has requested that kind of assistance from the federal government and believes the letter may have helped focus the administration’s attention on Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  His letter mentioned a  23-year-old Ukrainian refugee  who was stabbed to death on Charlotte public transit by a man with a history of arrests and mental health problems in September, drawing national attention to the city’s policing and public safety.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, but Trump used the incident as an example of what he has framed as a rampant crime issue in Democratic-run cities across the country, pledging to send in the National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that Customs and Border Protection are here in Charlotte now, you know that falls well within the request that we made,” Redford said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to McFadden, who declined to be interviewed for this story.\n \n\n   \n    Controversy\n \n\n   \n  McFadden’s workplace has been plagued by controversy in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  A former business director for his office sued the sheriff in federal court in September, alleging the McFadden illegally fired her as retaliation for reporting racial pay disparity in the agency and declining to alter records about the sheriff’s travel expenses.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff denied the allegations in a November court filing. CNN has sought comment from an attorney representing him in the suit.\n \n\n   \n  In the last year, The Charlotte Observer  reported  on several former employees who criticized the sheriff’s treatment of them, with some accusing him of emotional abuse and being narcissistic or vindictive. One of them, a former chief deputy, submitted a resignation letter accusing the sheriff of running the office like a dictatorship, the Observer  reported .\n \n\n   \n  That person also released a recording of McFadden using racial slurs to refer to a White captain and a Black former chief deputy,  CNN affiliate WBTV  reported.

choice for traffickers in Latin America \n       \n  By Tim Lister, Claudia Rebaza, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Trump  administration’s drone strikes against boats allegedly bringing illicit drugs to the US come amid an explosion in the amount of cocaine being produced in  Colombia and Peru .\n \n\n   \n  But there is a new – and lethal – factor that is turbo-charging production – especially in Peru: the relationship between coca cultivation and illicit gold mining.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a toxic combination that is enriching criminal gangs and corrupt officials, as the price of gold touches new highs on world markets. And it’s taking root in other states – including Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Peru’s then foreign minister Elmer Schialer said the illegal gold economy in Peru was seven times bigger than the cocaine trade.\n \n\n   \n  Colombia has traditionally been the epicenter of coca cultivation in South America. But cocaine production has spiked in Peru, where more than 800 tons were produced last year according to the US State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Coca cultivation has spread from remote mountainous areas into Peru’s lowlands, a huge stretch of land adjoining Brazil and Colombia, where new variants thrive.\n \n\n   \n  The region of Ucayali has seen the greatest increase in coca cultivation, as well as clandestine airstrips and drug exit routes, according to a recent Amazon Watch report by Ricardo Soberon, a former director of Devida, the official Peruvian agency tackling illegal drug flows. Research by investigative group Mongabay last year identified 128 clandestine airstrips cut into the jungle across six Peruvian regions, some surrounded by coca plantations.\n \n\n   \n  The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an exponential spread of illegal gold mining and coca production, said Dan Collyns, a writer on organized crime in the Amazon region.\n \n\n   \n  The police were enforcing a strict lockdown, giving free rein to organized crime groups to expand their territorial control, particularly in remote areas. And the lockdown meant that many Peruvians, more than 70% of whom work in the informal economy, were forced to find alternative incomes, often in illegal occupations, Collins said.\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, according to Collins, Peruvian producers have worked with mostly Mexican cartels to ship the processed drug from Peru’s Pacific coast. Several US strikes that have targeted vessels allegedly carrying drugs have been in the Pacific, but the vast majority of Peru’s cocaine is destined for Europe, according to a former Peruvian interior minister, Ruben Vargas.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Narco-mineria’\n \n\n   \n  The nexus of coca cultivation and illicit gold mining is offering a swifter route to riches for criminal enterprises across the Amazon region – from Peru and Ecuador to Colombia and Venezuela. It’s known as  narco-mineria , according to Collins.\n \n\n   \n  The advantage is simple.\n \n\n   \n  Cocaine is illegal from cultivation to its sale on the streets. Much of Peru’s gold is illicitly mined but when refined is indistinguishable from legitimate metal, its origin untraceable.\n \n\n   \n  “Criminal organizations have found that illegal gold mining is a safer and more lucrative asset in which they can invest money from drug trafficking, and, in turn, launder the assets more easily,” according to Collins, author of the forthcoming “Blood Gold: The Shocking True Story of the Amazon Gold Rush.”\n \n\n   \n  Gangs use “the same smuggling routes, logistics, precursor supplies like diesel, and use their territorial control to exploit whatever resources are available: gold, coca, timber,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Along Peru’s Amazon border with Colombia, dissidents from the Colombian rebel group FARC control production and distribution. Along Peru’s longer border with Brazil, “Comando Vermelho (Red Command), one of Brazil’s most powerful crime groups, has established itself,” according to Collins.\n \n\n   \n  “Initially, around 2021, we saw how it was vying for control of the tri-border area of ​​Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. Currently, we know that it manages illicit coca crops in Ucayali, which entails violent practices in the region, but it also controls mining operations and ‘security’ in Madre de Dios,” said Pamela Huerta, an investigative journalist with the Amazon Underground project.\n \n\n   \n  Vargas, the former interior minister, told CNN: “The Red Command has hooked into these two commodities of the illegal economy and is trying to control the routes and the production centers.”\n \n\n   \n  It is now shipping cocaine to Brazil to feed the rapidly growing market there – and in the meantime stoking what Vargas calls the worst surge in crime in Peru’s history.\n \n\n   \n  Further east, across the Amazon basin, Colombian gangs are working with Venezuelan groups in both illegal mining and cocaine trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  There is “unchecked illegal mining” in the southern Venezuelan regions of Amazonas and Bolivar, according to the global think tank Crisis Group, “strengthening Venezuelan criminal enterprises, Colombian guerrilla groups and corrupt elites.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is now reportedly home to over 30 per cent of the illegal mining sites in the Amazon basin, Crisis Group estimates.\n \n\n   \n  “In some cases, members of the armed forces have taken sole charge of the pits for their personal enrichment,” according to a recent report by Crisis Group. Colombian gangs and Venezuelan syndicates known as  sistemas  both operate in the region and have even begun moving into neighboring Guyana, it says.\n \n\n   \n  “Drug trafficking routes in southern Venezuela pass through the same remote jungle terrain, with profits from the narcotics trade frequently laundered through investments in the gold industry.”\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador has also seen a surge in crime related to illegal gold mines near the Peruvian border, while a ruthless Peruvian gang calling itself Guardianes de la Trocha (Guardians of the Trail) is running a protection racket at illegal mines.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year Guardianes allegedly shot dead Ana Denisse García Solsol, a prominent figure in the Peruvian town of La Pampa. Local prosecutors believe mass graves contain the bodies of more than 100 people killed by the group.\n \n\n   \n  In the face of these powerful gangs and vast unpoliced areas of forest, eradication efforts and prosecutions are sporadic.\n \n\n   \n  The Peruvian interior ministry says it eradicated some 27,000 hectares of coca cultivation in the first nine months of this year. But eradication has also worsened deforestation by pushing cultivation into more remote areas, Soberon said.\n \n\n   \n  “Deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon, the poisoning of its rivers, and the loss of wild flora and fauna, in addition to the impact on the communities that have lived ancestrally in these territories, are irreversible at this point,” Huerta told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Peru’s volatile, fractured politics, as well as widespread corruption, have aggravated the situation. There have been more than a dozen interior ministers in the past five years.\n \n\n   \n  Often, illegal logging and mining are a result of the corrupt award of licenses and permits by elected public officials and senior bureaucrats, according to a report from the UN Office on Drug Control.\n \n\n   \n  “The result is weak internal security and a lack of continuity in law enforcement. At the same time, lobbies within Peru’s unpopular Congress favor illegal gold mining,” the writer Collyns said.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the income from those businesses is finding its way into Peruvian politics ahead of next year’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  Vargas, the former interior minister, agrees that the response to illegal mining is tainted by its links to the political system.\n \n\n   \n  On top of that, he said, “the fight against drugs has been abandoned” in regions where consumption is highest, including Europe and Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  “They are turning producer countries into fertile ground for transnational criminal groups.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/entertainment/wicked-for-good-politics-immigration","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"Wicked: For Good is one of the most political films of the year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The film 'Wicked: For Good' is analyzed as one of the most politically charged cinematic releases of 2025, drawing direct parallels between its narrative themes of propaganda, immigration restriction, and racial prejudice and real-world policies under the Trump administration.

\n       \n  Analysis by Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For anyone who loves “ Wicked ,” it’s easy to get swept up in the magic, the music and the  sisterhood between the central pair of star-crossed friends  at the heart of the story.\n \n\n   \n  But it was also hard to ignore the  first film’s  political underpinnings, which shine even brighter in the follow up “Wicked: For Good,” in theaters now.\n \n\n   \n  In the first part of the cinematic adaptation by director Jon M. Chu, which was nominated for best picture at last year’s Oscars, themes of racial tension were the backdrop to the story – which imagines an origin for the Wicked Witch of the West made famous in the 1939 classic film “The Wizard of Oz,” and explores her relationship with Glinda the Good. Woven into the premise are questions about how we embrace (or reject) those we feel are Other, as we see Glinda (Ariana Grande) at first denigrate green-skinned Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), before warming up to her.\n \n\n   \n  Their fragile bond is tested, however, when they come to discover that the feared and respected Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is, in fact, a grand manipulator who intends to use Elphaba to achieve his goal of silencing the enchanted animals of Oz, who are seen having their rights increasingly stripped away and losing their ability to speak. The Wizard works with Elphaba’s teacher Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) to devise propaganda throughout Oz about Elphaba, thereby bestowing on her the identity of a “wicked witch.”\n \n\n   \n  The concluding chapter raises the stakes and leans hard into another scorchingly hot political topic: immigration.\n \n\n   \n  In one scene, Boq (Ethan Slater) from Munchkinland goes to the train station to fulfill his desire to travel to the Emerald City and profess his love to Glinda. However, when he gets to the station, he is horrified to see that animals and Munchkins have been restricted from traveling and need a permit to do so. The policy was orchestrated by the newly appointed Governor of Munchkinland, Nessarose Thropp (Marissa Bode), who pines for Boq.\n \n\n   \n  The scene depicts dramatic, harrowing moments in which the enchanted animals are blocked from being able to move about freely. Later in the film, some animals are seen hidden in a basement within the Wizard’s palace in Emerald City, locked away in cages.\n \n\n   \n  The scenes bear eerie resemblance to familiar images seen and stories heard from those affected by the Trump administration’s unprecedented  crackdown  on undocumented immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Cities and regions across the country – from  Charlotte, North Carolina  to Chicago – have been left on edge as immigration raids have taken place there. In Charlotte, businesses closed in the wake of federal agents descending upon the area and more than 200  people have been arrested  since what the Department of Homeland Security referred to as “Operation Charlotte’s Web”  began  last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump’s administration continues to say its enforcement is targeting criminals and gang members. In June, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targets “the worst of the worst,” adding that “in President (Donald) Trump’s first 100 days, 75% of ICE arrests were criminal illegal aliens with convictions or pending charges.”\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin did not respond to a request at the time to clarify the nature of those convictions or pending charges.\n \n\n   \n   Countless cases  contradict the administration’s claims. Internal government documents obtained by CNN this summer showed that only 10% of migrants booked into ICE custody since October 2024 had been convicted of serious violent or sexual crimes.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘good enemy’\n \n\n   \n  In the world of Oz, the Wizard also highlights groups that he terms as unsafe, at one point saying, “The best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good enemy.”\n \n\n   \n  That enemy is the animals, a notion that Elphaba wholeheartedly rejects. And in “Wicked: For Good,” we see her actively intervening against the Wizard’s activities, disrupting construction on the Yellow Brick Road and attempting to spread the word that he is lying to the people of Oz and causing the animals to flee in fear, which we see them attempt to do via an underground tunnel beneath the Yellow Brick Road.\n \n\n   \n  “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,” the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel on which the films and Tony-winning Broadway musical are based, is, of course, a dark text itself.\n \n\n   \n  Philip Lightstone, who served as a swing and dance captain over two runs of the official “Wicked” national touring production in the US, said he thinks the movies have benefitted from having more space to show various facets of Ozian society that are described in the novel, elements that the long-running musical was never able to delve into.\n \n\n   \n  In “Wicked: For Good,” the notion that political power amounts to who has the power to disseminate information – even if the truth behind said information is questionable – comes to a head.\n \n\n   \n  “The backdrop really is this political, propaganda, whose truth is real, kind of thing,” Lightstone said. “Whoever’s in control gets to say what the quote-unquote truth is, what’s real.”\n \n\n   \n  The weightier scenes in “For Good” will likely in equal measure hit home and  stir   some backlash , just as the first film did.\n \n\n   \n  But those who take issue with the film for  getting political , frankly, have greatly missed the point of the work in all its forms.\n \n\n   \n  Lightstone recalled that the tour’s directorial team led by Joe Mantello and choreographers led by Wayne Cilento would often use political events to help the company connect to what was happening on stage.\n \n\n   \n  “They were always talking about connecting whatever was happening politically – even if there was something super specific,  travel bans  or this or that – to be able to have the cast connect with that,” said Lightstone, who toured with the show from 2006-2013 and again from 2016-2020. “People have to be able to relate to something that they understand politically for the show to work.”\n \n\n   \n  The same goes for the films.\n \n\n   \n  Another scene in this weekend’s “For Good” shows Elphaba standing over the hole in the Yellow Brick Road leading to the underground tunnel. It won’t be lost on many that Erivo also portrayed slave liberator and Underground Railroad figure Harriet Tubman in the 2019 Oscar-nominated film “Harriet.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to “Wicked: For Good” director Chu, along with writers Winnie Holzman, Stephen Schwartz and Maguire for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Releasing just in time for award season to kick into high gear, “Wicked: For Good” is in solid politically-charged-film company this year.\n \n\n   \n  “One Battle After Another,” directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and already  at the forefront of the Oscar conversation , follows a down-and-out former revolutionary whose daughter becomes a pawn in a conflict with a demented and racist old foe who is connected to a nefarious underground network. Other buzzy entries that have also hit on political themes this year include Ari Aster’s “ Eddington ,” a treatise on the pandemic and a lot more, and Oscar-winner Kathryn Bigelow’s “ A House of Dynamite ,” which angered the Pentagon due to its commentary on the US’s nuclear capabilities and handling of its weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Escapism will always come into play for holiday moviegoing, but the prospect of a movie – even one set in the magical land of Oz – inspiring conversation about serious, real-world matters affecting lots of families this season would be a change for, well, good.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/us/murdaugh-murders-hulu-show","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Fact vs. Fiction: The Real Story Behind the Murdaugh Murders and Hulu’s Dramatized Retelling","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hulu’s 'Murdaugh: Death in the Family' miniseries dramatizes the 2021 murder case of Alex Murdaugh’s wife and son, blending factual events with fictionalized narrative elements.

It starts with a warning.\n \n\n   \n  Before a single scene plays, Hulu’s “Murdaugh: Death in the Family” true crime miniseries flashes a familiar disclaimer across a black screen: “While this program is inspired by actual events, certain parts have been fictionalized solely for dramatic purposes and are not intended to reflect on any actual person or entity.”\n \n\n   \n  Moments later, viewers are dropped into the glow of a grand Southern home. Every light is on, every room frozen in time. Cheerful family photos. A framed copy of the poem “The Man in the Glass.” A sign that reads, “The Murdaughs together is our favorite place to be.”\n \n\n   \n  And then the warmth disappears, replaced with the dripping of blood – slow and unmistakable, pooling from the bodies of a mother and her son.\n \n\n   \n  The scene cuts to an actor, Jason Clarke, replicating Alex Murdaugh’s desperate 911 call, his voice cracking as he pleads for help. His wife Maggie (Patricia Arquette) and son Paul (Johnny Berchtold) lie motionless, blood seeping into concrete and grass while he wipes his face, crying, pacing, unraveling.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a chilling opening to a series that dramatizes the violent collapse of a powerful South Carolina Lowcountry lineage – a dynasty built on influence, now defined by secrets laid bare.\n \n\n   \n  At the center is the crime that dominated headlines: Alex Murdaugh’s  prosecution  for the 2021 killings of his wife and son. A jury convicted him in March 2023, sentencing him to life in prison in a case that captivated the country.\n \n\n   \n  For eight hours, the series unspools the family’s unraveling, layer by layer, scandal by scandal, mixing documented facts with dramatized interpretations.\n \n\n   \n  Alex Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, have sharply criticized the series, calling it inaccurate and “misleading” in its portrayal of the family and the events surrounding the case. In a statement to CNN, they said Hulu never contacted Alex Murdaugh, his son Buster, or attorneys to verify details or hear their perspective, instead relying on “sensationalized accounts” from sources with no direct connection to the Murdaughs.\n \n\n   \n  Hulu series co-creator Michael D. Fuller explained on the first episode of the official “Murdaugh: Death in the Family” podcast the series aimed to blend factual events with emotional storytelling.\n \n\n   \n  ”These are human beings. They’re complex. They’re complicated. It’s our version of them, obviously, but hopefully, there’s some truth illuminated about how they interacted with each other,” he said. “It’s that human drama that’s at the heart of (the series) that I would really love for people to take away.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Hulu for comment.\n \n\n   \n  So how much of what viewers saw was real?\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what the series gets right — and what it doesn’t.\n \n\n   \n    The true order of events vs. the show’s  rewrite\n \n\n   \n  The series shifts key events to suit its narrative flow. Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh family’s housekeeper for more than two decades, is elevated to a central character to anchor the show’s emotional arc. In doing so,  her death is depicted  alongside the February 2019 boat crash involving Paul Murdaugh, an arrangement that does not match the real timeline.\n \n\n   \n  Satterfield actually died in 2018, but the show features her as alive a year later. She is portrayed as a kind, loving person, and an important figure in Paul Murdaugh’s life.\n \n\n   \n  “We decided that in order to show her relationship with the family, with Paul in particular, and what that meant, and then feel her loss when she had been there,” Fuller explained during the podcast. “It made story truth sense to have her be alive and see how that plays out in the current timeline of our show.”\n \n\n   \n  It is true that Satterfield  died after a fall  at the Murdaugh home. What the series dramatizes is the lead-up to that fall. The show depicts her tripping while carrying the family’s luggage inside, suggesting Alex pressured her to do so despite her known back issues. There is no evidence this occurred.\n \n\n   \n  The series also covers Alex Murdaugh’s elaborate scheme to seize Satterfield’s insurance settlements after her death. In the show, he introduces Satterfield’s two sons, Brian and Tony, to a lawyer named Cory Fleming and lays out his plan: Fleming would represent the Satterfields in a lawsuit against Murdaugh’s insurance company, Murdaugh would claim responsibility, and the settlement would cover their bills — and more.\n \n\n   \n  On screen, Brian collapses into Murdaugh’s arms with gratitude. Later, Murdaugh, his banker and the attorney are shown celebrating a $3.8 million settlement, money the show implies they kept for themselves instead of giving to Satterfield’s children.\n \n\n   \n  The core of the scheme is true, but the numbers are dramatized. In reality, a  settlement agreement  stipulated $2,765,000 for the Satterfield family, but they never saw that money, the affidavit said. Instead, the money went to an account Murdaugh created and owned for his own use,  an affidavit  from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) said.\n \n\n   \n  Another inaccuracy in the timeline was the family vacation to the Bahamas, shown on the show as happening after Paul Murdaugh’s boat crash.\n \n\n   \n  They did go on a vacation to the Bahamas two years before the crash and met some British tourists who, after the murders,   appeared on Fox News   and talked about meeting Paul. Contrary to the series’ dramatization, there is no evidence that Paul was involved in any physical altercation with anyone during the vacation, as depicted in the show.\n \n\n   \n    When addiction meets deception\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the Murdaugh saga – both the series and the truth – is a pattern of long-running, calculated deception.\n \n\n   \n  Hulu’s depiction of Alex Murdaugh’s engagement in extensive financial fraud – including embezzling funds from his own law firm, misappropriating client money and committing insurance fraud – are well-documented and formed a key part of the investigations leading up to his criminal trials.\n \n\n   \n  While the series uses a fictional client named “Alvarez” to illustrate Murdaugh’s pattern of theft, the underlying misconduct is real. In reality, Murdaugh was convicted of  stealing settlement money from multiple personal injury clients. \n \n\n   \n  According to court documents, he funneled those payments  into a fake account he created called “Forge Consulting,”  allowing him to quietly divert the funds for his own use while keeping the victims and his own law firm in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  The jellyfish-harvesting venture depicted in the series is based on a real business attempt by Alex Murdaugh, but the show significantly distorts both the timeline. In reality, Murdaugh’s jellyfish operation was shut down by South Carolina’s Department of Health and Environmental Control in 2014 over permitting issues and environmental concerns — years earlier than the timeframe shown on screen,  according to reporting from FITSNews. \n \n\n   \n  Showrunner Fuller  later told MovieWeb the jellyfish storyline  wasn’t meant to be a factual retelling but a symbolic “Southern business endeavor,” standing in for the various side deals and land ventures Alex Murdaugh was pursuing at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Alongside the financial crimes, Alex Murdaugh struggled with a serious substance abuse problem,  particularly opioids , he previously testified.   \n \n\n   \n  The series portrays this addiction through dramatic visuals — showing him popping pills in private or struggling to function — though some of the specific moments may be fictionalized.\n \n\n   \n    Paul Murdaugh’s deadly boat crash and its ripple effects\n \n\n   \n  In February 2019, Paul Murdaugh was at the center of a tragedy that would become a defining chapter in the family’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  The Murdaugh family’s boat, which Paul was on with several friends including 19-year-old Mallory Beach, crashed into the Archers Creek Bridge in Beaufort County, South Carolina, according to investigators. Beach was  thrown into the water  and later found dead.\n \n\n   \n  Hulu’s depiction of the events, although dramatic, is reasonably accurate. After the crash, Paul Murdaugh was charged with boating under the influence causing severe bodily injury and death — charges that were  still pending  at the time of his own death in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  It is also true that Beach’s family filed a wrongful death  lawsuit  against Alex Murdaugh and the convenience stores that illegally sold alcohol to the underage group that night.\n \n\n   \n   Police said  Paul Murdaugh was drunk when he crashed his father’s boat into a bridge with five friends aboard, tossing Beach into the water. Search teams found her body a week after the crash.\n \n\n   \n  Both in the show and in real life, friends and witnesses told investigators Paul  was heavily intoxicated,  and surveillance and video evidence suggested he may have been driving, though the exact driver became a point of controversy.\n \n\n   \n  This crash — its aftermath, the lawsuit, and the scrutiny it brought — marked one of the first major fractures in the Murdaugh family’s carefully maintained public image.\n \n\n   \n    The relationship dynamics between the Murdaughs\n \n\n   \n  The series leans heavily on what its creators call a blend of “truth” truth and “emotional truth” — a mix of documented facts and imagined moments designed to capture how the Murdaughs  might  have interacted behind closed doors.\n \n\n   \n  One “truth” truth was the inclusion of journalist Mandy Matney (Brittany Snow), who appears in the series investigating the Murdaugh family’s secrets. Matney is a real reporter, and the show draws heavily from her reporting and perspective featured in her true-crime podcast.\n \n\n   \n  As showrunner Fuller put it, the goal was getting “to the human, emotional story,” even when specific scenes aren’t rooted in verified events.\n \n\n   \n  This approach is most visible in the family dynamics. The actors are placed in tense confrontations, intimate conversations and private moments no one outside the family can substantiate, including awkward dinners, spiritual retreats and fleeting, charged arguments.\n \n\n   \n  These scenes give the audience emotional access, but they are ultimately dramatizations; there’s no public record confirming they ever happened.\n \n\n   \n  The series also attempts to humanize the Murdaughs, presenting them as complicated rather than purely villainous or sympathetic. But Alex Murdaugh and his defense team have criticized the portrayals, arguing the show misrepresents his relationships with Maggie and Paul and leans into sensationalized tension that didn’t exist in real life.\n \n\n   \n  “Alex is deeply disappointed and disturbed by the recent Hulu streaming series about him and the entire Murdaugh family … The depiction of their personal family dynamics is particularly troubling, as it totally mischaracterizes Alex’s relationships with his wife Maggie and his son Paul, both of whom Alex loves so dearly,” a statement from Murdaugh’s lawyer read.\n \n\n   \n  “Alex was always extremely proud of Paul.

Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:10 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said he and his family are among the Republicans targeted in a wave of threats against state officeholders this week as President Donald Trump  pressures Hoosier State lawmakers  to redraw the state’s  congressional maps .\n \n\n   \n  At least eight Republican state senators said they had been the subject of swatting attempts, threats of violence or intimidation efforts this week. Most of the attempts were reported after  the Senate on Tuesday voted to adjourn  until January — rejecting Braun’s call for a special session focused on redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Enough is enough,” Braun said in a Friday afternoon  social media post . “These threats to lawmakers, including those received by me and my family in recent days, need to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The alarming rise in threats against Indiana officials comes amid growing concerns about political violence, particularly after the September assassination of Charlie Kirk. Lawmakers and candidates in both parties have reported facing a sharp rise in threats and fears for their safety, with some – notably including US Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia – committing to lowering the tone of their rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  At least  three congressional Democrats’ offices  were targeted by bomb threats after they participated in a video urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. Trump described the Democrats’ video message as “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”\n \n\n   \n  “Political violence and threats like this are unacceptable,” Rep. Chris Deluzio’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement has not attributed the Indiana threats to a specific person or identified a cause. But the most recent reports come after Trump posted multiple times this week on his Truth Social platform about Indiana, where Republican senators have declined to convene for a special session to attempt to eliminate one or both of the state’s Democrat-held seats in the US House.\n \n\n   \n  “Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats,” Trump posted Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Senators Bray, Goode, and the others to be released to the public later this afternoon, should DO THEIR JOB, AND DO IT NOW!” he said. “If not, let’s get them out of office, ASAP.”\n \n\n   \n  Later Sunday, after Trump’s Truth Social post, Goode’s home was swatted, Goode and Vigo County Sheriff Derek Fell both said. Swatting is a false report made to authorities with the express purpose of luring them to a location — usually a home — where they are led to believe a horrific crime has been committed or is in progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump posted again Monday that Bray, the Indiana Senate president pro tem, would face a primary challenge despite not being up for reelection until 2028, “as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Indiana Republicans denounce what they call ‘intimidation’ attempts\n \n\n   \n  In a rare bipartisan statement Friday, Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston and the top-ranking Democrat, state Rep. Phil GiaQuinta, said they are “praying for our colleagues, their families and neighbors, and our law enforcement partners.”\n \n\n   \n  “The threats, swatting attempts and other criminal activity being directed at our colleagues in the Senate are abhorrent and completely unacceptable. This is no way to express political disagreement, and it must stop,” the two House leaders said.\n \n\n   \n  Braun, the first-term Republican governor, said the Indiana State Police and other law enforcement “have been working around the clock all week to protect lawmakers and investigate threats.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the state police said they are working with both federal and local law enforcement officials to investigate.\n \n\n   \n  “Our goal is to seek criminal prosecution against those involved, to the fullest extent allowed by law,” the state police said in a statement. Their spokesperson, Capt. Ron Galaviz, when asked whether law enforcement believes the incidents are connected, directed CNN to that statement, which does not address the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on its role in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Andy Zay, a Republican from Huntington, said his rental car business was targeted Thursday with a bomb threat.\n \n\n   \n  And state Sen. Linda Rogers, a Republican from Granger, said in a statement she has been “the victim of several intimidation incidents,” and that local and state police are investigating. She said she would not provide additional details at the time.\n \n\n   \n  At least six more state senators said this week they’ve been the targets of swatting attempts. Several oppose redistricting, though neither Zay nor Rogers have taken a public position.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be clear: I strongly condemn these acts, which have no place in our political process,” Zay said in a statement. “While the intent behind these intimidation threats seems to be to instill fear in public officials, I can assure my constituents that I remain committed to serving our district, being your voice and continuing my work at the Statehouse.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/attack-demo-venezuela-maduro-terrorist-designation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:59:00.000-05:00","title":"Days ahead of terrorism designation for Maduro, US military performs large ‘attack demo’ near Venezuela","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Days ahead of designating Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his allies as part of a foreign terrorist organization known as 'Cartel de los Soles,' the US military conducted its largest show of force near Venezuela, including the deployment of a B-52 bomber, a supersonic F/A-18E fighter jet, and a signals intelligence RC-135 aircraft.

show of force to date near Venezuela on Thursday, ahead of a key Monday deadline that will see the US designate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more  a description of allegedly corrupt government officials  than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions. It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts.\n \n\n   \n  Still, administration officials have been making the case that the terrorist designation will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “It gives more tools to our department to give options to the President,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  While the US has been accumulating military assets in the region, Trump has suggested he may still be open to a diplomatic solution, though to date there have been no public indications of progress toward deescalation.\n \n\n   \n  In the largest military display near Venezuela since the US began threatening military action, at least six US aircraft appeared off the coast of Venezuela on Thursday over the course of several hours, including a supersonic F/A-18E fighter jet, a B-52 strategic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, according to a CNN review of open-source flight data.\n \n\n   \n  A statement  posted  by the United States Air Forces Southern Command on Friday characterized the drill as a “bomber attack demo” to deter illicit trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The F/A-18E flew from the USS Gerald Ford, which arrived in the Caribbean earlier this week. An RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance plane, equipped with signals intelligence capabilities, also appeared circling in “racetrack” loops near Venezuela’s eastern border.\n \n\n   \n  That show of force happened hours before Trump told Fox News on Friday that he would be speaking to Maduro “in the not-too-distant future.”\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t tell you what I’m going to tell him, but I have something very specific to say,” he said.  Earlier in the week Trump had publicly suggested that he was open to talks, though it’s unclear when the two leaders may connect.\n \n\n   \n  Ric Grenell, a Trump special envoy, had been leading dialogue with the Maduro regime earlier this year. But the White House called off those discussions last month as the US military continued to amass a large footprint in the region, according to a source.\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, the Qataris had passed messages and facilitated discussions between the US and the Maduro regime, but they have not been asked to serve in that role in recent months, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration could turn to other countries that have contact with the Maduro regime, but so far it appears that they have not asked another country to send messages to the regime on their behalf, based on discussions with diplomats in countries that currently maintain dialogue with the regime.\n \n\n   \n  The designation of “Cartel de los Soles” only furthers the pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has named as the leader of that group. The label is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism tools.\n \n\n   \n  It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US. The Trump administration notified Congress on November 16 that it would apply the designation to “Cartel de los Soles” starting a countdown to Monday for lawmakers to object, though Congress has not taken action to block the move.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has been conducting training missions near Venezuela in the air and at sea for several weeks adding pressure to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The missions, which began in mid-October, have been carried out by both B-52s and supersonic B-1 heavy bombers, inching closer to the Venezuelan coastline each time. The flights have been concentrated north of Caracas and Isla Margarita, an island retreat where Venezuelan military forces trained for amphibious operations last month.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also briefed repeatedly earlier this month on options for attacking Venezuelan military and government facilities directly,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Isa Cardona contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/asia/bangladesh-india-sheikh-hasina-death-sentence-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:01:00-05:00","title":"Bangladesh Plans to Execute Former Leader; India Blocks Extradition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, was sentenced to death by Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal for her role in the violent suppression of student protests in 2024, which led to the collapse of her regime.

Ziaur Rahman – the husband of her future arch-nemesis, Khaleda Zia – rose to power, his regime passing a law that would protect Mujibur’s assassins for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight, Hasina’s life was transformed, and she was forced into six years of exile in India, which imprinted a deep respect for the Indian state on the future leader.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally returned to Bangladesh in 1981, it was to a nation clamoring for its founding ideals of secularism. But she also entered a political arena about to be defined by another woman pushed into tragedy: Zia, whose husband had himself been assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  Recalling the day of her return from forced exile, Hasina  said : “When I landed at the airport, I didn’t get anyone of my (relatives) but received love of millions of people, and that was my only strength.”\n \n\n   \n  Thus began the era of the “Battling Begums” – a deeply personal, yet destructive duel between two women that would grip Bangladesh for the next 30 years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘She had to flee’\n \n\n   \n  Taking the helm of her father’s Awami League, Hasina embarked on a long journey through the political wilderness, navigating house arrests and crackdowns amid a growing rivalry with Zia. In 1996, Hasina led her party to electoral victory, becoming Prime Minister for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Her first act in office was to announce the prosecution of those involved in the 1975 coup and murders of her family, finally beginning a quest for justice.\n \n\n   \n  A secular Muslim, Hasina served for one term, losing the next election to Zia. But when she returned to power in 2008, she was seen as a changed leader – someone more resolute, less trusting and determined to permanently secure her position.\n \n\n   \n  For the next 15 years, she ruled Bangladesh with an increasingly iron fist, ushering an era of strong economic growth. At the same time, she gave India crucial support, bolstering New Delhi through economic and security deals in a neighborhood that includes adversaries Pakistan and China.\n \n\n   \n  But Bangladesh’s developmental success came at a steep price: human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. Critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.\n \n\n   \n  As the pressure mounted, Hasina “could bank on India for full-fledged, no questions asked support,” The Indian Express newspaper reflected in a  recent  editorial.\n \n\n   \n  At home, however, her image became associated with an aggressive crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “She committed so much bloodshed to be in power,” the political scientist Hasan said.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s grip on power was seemingly unbreakable. She had proven adept at surviving storms of popular protest, arrests and assassination attempts, but the youth-led uprising that erupted last year was different.\n \n\n   \n  What began as student demonstrations over civil service job quotas quickly swelled into a nationwide roar for her resignation. The regime’s response was a brutal crackdown that, according to the UN human rights office, left as many as 1,400 people dead.\n \n\n   \n  But the bloodshed did not crush the movement – it galvanized it, turning public anger into an unstoppable force that ultimately toppled her government.\n \n\n   \n  “She had to flee,” Hasan said. “That act itself is an acknowledgement of guilt. The people, the forces, everyone turned against her because she pushed the boundaries. She killed, her order was to kill so many.”\n \n\n   \n    Sentenced to death\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s life as a political refugee in New Delhi brings her story full circle, returning her to the same state of exile she endured nearly half a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina was tried in absentia and sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court – a judicial body that she helped set up. There, Hasina faced charges primarily related to inciting the murder of protesters, ordering demonstrators be hanged, and ordering the use of lethal weapons, drones and helicopters to suppress the unrest.\n \n\n   \n  The court found it “crystal clear” that she had ordered the killing of student demonstrators. The death sentence was met with applause and tears in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  “It pacified us a bit,” Abdur Rab, the father of one victim, told Reuters. “But we will be fully content when we see the hangman’s rope around her neck.”\n \n\n   \n  India, which also has the death penalty, adopted a neutral stance, noting the verdict and vowing to “engage constructively with all stakeholders.”\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s family has praised New Delhi for giving her refuge. “India has always been a good friend,” Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, told local news agency ANI. “In the crisis, India has essentially saved my mother’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  For more than a decade, Hasina was one of India’s most steadfast regional allies. Her government was instrumental in cracking down on anti-India insurgent groups that used Bangladeshi territory as a safe haven.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had previously  lauded  Hasina for keeping their countries’ extensive border secure. Now her government’s downfall has raised significant security concerns in New Delhi that radical Islamist groups could re-emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Anil Trigunayat, an Indian diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said he “doubts very much” that New Delhi will send Hasina home to face prison or death.\n \n\n   \n  The former leader has rejected the allegations against her as a political witch hunt, allowing India to make a potential case that the charges against her were politically motivated.\n \n\n   \n  India’s extradition law, as well as its extradition treaty with Bangladesh, contains a “political offense” exception, designed for situations like this, allowing a state to refuse extradition if the crime is political in nature.\n \n\n   \n  “India will have to look at it (as a) political crime, not the crimes against humanity for which she has been charged there,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But Trigunayat noted that Hasina hasn’t exhausted all legal remedies. She can appeal the verdict in Bangladesh’s Supreme Court, then potentially the International Criminal Court in The Hague, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Since not all the remedies are exhausted, India would not be in a rush to send her,” Trigunayat said.\n \n\n   \n  The day Hasina was sentenced, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry called on India to hand her over “without delay.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is India’s responsibility in keeping with the existing bilateral extradition treaty between both countries,” the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s death sentence sets a tense stage for Bangladesh’s elections planned for next February.\n \n\n   \n  With her Awami League now banned and its leadership scattered, the interim government led by former Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus faces the monumental task of steering the nation out of its deeply polarized political culture.\n \n\n   \n  The Awami League’s absence leaves the political field open for its chief rival, Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and dozens of other smaller parties, to contest any future election, though experts warn the deep-seated divisions may not be easily resolved.\n \n\n   \n  “Bangladesh is far from reconciliation at this stage,” said the political scientist Hasan.\n \n\n   \n  He says the Awami League may attempt to stage a political comeback, albeit not under Hasina’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether Hasina’s demise marks the end of a toxic era, or simply the beginning of a new chapter of uncertainty.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/22/europe/russia-rubicon-unit-drone-revolution-ukraine-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"06:27:00-04:00","title":"Russia’s drone revolution heaps pressure on Ukrainian defenses","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the rise of Russia’s Rubicon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies as a pivotal force in modern drone warfare during the Ukraine conflict.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:27 AM EST, Sat November 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A top-secret Russian unit based in Moscow has changed the landscape of drone warfare, turning what was an advantage for the Ukrainians into a vulnerability.\n \n\n   \n  The unit is known as Rubicon and has expanded rapidly under Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov since his appointment in June last year. Belousov visited its headquarters in October 2024 and was shown a range of drones being developed, according to video published by official  Russian media .\n \n\n   \n  The advent of Rubicon – full name the Rubicon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies – is a prime example of how the Russian military has learnt to shrug off its rigid way of warfare during the Ukraine conflict and adapt to a rapidly evolving battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine had already established a separate branch within its military – the Unmanned Systems Forces – in mid-2024.\n \n\n   \n  As Rubicon proved its worth, Russian President Vladimir Putin  announced in June  that Russia would establish a military command dedicated to “unmanned aerial systems.”\n \n\n   \n  That unit came into being last week.\n \n\n   \n  “The head of unmanned systems has been appointed, and military command and control bodies have been created at all levels,” said its deputy commander, Col. Sergei Ishtuganov.\n \n\n   \n  “Just a year ago, our troops weren’t so saturated with drones of all types. But gradually, Russian units managed to turn the tide in the skies,” he told Russian daily  kp.ru. \n \n\n   \n  “We are assigning operators, engineers, technicians and other support specialists to these units,” Ishtuganov added, a clear sign of the resources being dedicated to the command.\n \n\n   \n  It even has its own  emblem  – featuring a crossed arrow and sword, with a microchip bearing a star and wings in the center.\n \n\n   \n  Rubicon is not just about designing and deploying drones. It develops and tests advanced robotic systems and AI.\n \n\n   \n  It pioneered the use of fiber-optic drones, which have had a significant impact on the battlefield. These are controlled via a fiber-optic cable, providing a secure video feed in real time and cannot be jammed.\n \n\n   \n  It also improves the performance of other units.\n \n\n   \n  “Rubicon formations remain a leading problem for [(Ukrainian)] drone operators, not only the drone companies themselves, but because they train other Russian drone units,” notes  Michael Kofman , a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.\n \n\n   \n    From the lab to the front lines\n \n\n   \n  Within months of Rubicon’s establishment, its units were fanning out across the front lines with a new generation of drones, turning the tables on Ukrainian forces.\n \n\n   \n  Their first known involvement was inside Russia, after Ukrainian forces entered and took a part of the Kursk region last summer. Shortly after Rubicon’s appearance in the area, the Ukrainian military reported that their supply lines had been almost completely cut off by drone attacks.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces withdrew from the area early this year. Later, two commanders told CNN that a well-trained Russian unit had suddenly changed the battle, hunting Ukrainian logistics and drone operators. At the time, they had no idea Rubicon had been deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Rubicon units have been reported in many parts of the battlefield, often giving Russian troops an advantage by attacking Ukrainian supply routes well behind the front lines – as well as enemy drone operators.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the commander of Ukraine’s 93rd Brigade battalion  told CNN  that Rubicon units had been integrated with Russian brigades in the Kostiantynivka area of Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n  Within a week, he said, his unit had lost most of its vehicles, drone launch sites, antennas, and communications equipment. From the beginning of the war, the Russians have  tried to target  Ukrainian drone operators. Rubicon units have taken that to a new level.\n \n\n   \n  The conflict is now “a saturated drone operating environment,” according to military analyst Mick Ryan, who was recently in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Ryan said frontline officers had told him that Russian innovation in drones probably now just outstrips that of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Within 15 kilometers (9 miles) of the front line, vehicle movement is difficult to impossible. Infantry soldiers must march to their positions for 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles),” Ryan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Where armoured vehicles and artillery are deployed, these can be subject to dozens of attacks per platform per day. Every HQ is now buried deep underground to avoid detection and destruction by Russian drones,” according to Ryan, author of the blog Futura Doctrina.\n \n\n   \n  “Today it is drone pilots who are the architects of victory, shaping the modern battlefield. They are the ones who, to a large extent, ensure the advance of… infantry,” wrote the Russian Telegram channel Lost Armor, posting a nearly five-minute  video  of Ukrainian armor that had been destroyed in the Pokrovsk area.\n \n\n   \n    Hunting for Rubicon forward bases\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces have erected nets on roads and tracks behind the front lines to ensnare Rubicon’s drones, but they are of limited help given the sprawling combat zone.\n \n\n   \n  Rubicon has also been innovative in developing radar networks to bring down Ukrainian drones.\n \n\n   \n  “They captured ALL TYPES of our main UAVs as trophies,” says Ukrainian electronic warfare specialist  Serhiy Beskrestnov . “Of course, they studied all the electronics, communication systems inside our UAVs, and navigation systems.”\n \n\n   \n  Rubicon also appears to have been involved in the first successful use of a Russian naval drone, which struck a Ukrainian vessel in the Danube estuary in August.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Rubicon claimed to have taken out a Ukrainian naval vessel mooring at a gas production facility in the Black Sea.\n \n\n   \n  So important are Rubicon units that the Ukrainian security services are now intensively searching out their forward bases. A drone strike on a Russian base in occupied Avdiivka destroyed a Rubicon headquarters earlier this month, according to Ukrainian Defense Intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  One Ukrainian drone unit attached to the 71st Jaeger brigade recently  posted video  showing strikes on antennas and hide-outs in Sumy that it said belonged to “the elite Russian Rubicon unit.”\n \n\n   \n  “We detect, search for antennas, satellite communication terminals, dugouts, and strike them,” said Vyacheslav, the unit’s commander. They had detected take-off points and intercepted radio communications to establish the presence of a Rubicon unit, he said.\n \n\n   \n  While the two sides have similar capabilities, the Russians had an advantage in the number of fiber-optic drones they were producing, Vyacheslav told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The availability of these drones, how many they can launch, how many we can launch. That’s the key difference.” And there were more Rubicon operators now, he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘War shapes armies’\n \n\n   \n  The conflict in Ukraine has increasingly become one of counter-measures, designed to leap-frog or neutralize an innovation by the enemy.  It’s a constant battle between drones and electronic warfare that can detect, jam or spoof enemy drones.\n \n\n   \n  “The enemy plays with frequencies; we reconfigure our electronic warfare systems. The enemy begins to suppress us with electronic warfare; we switch to other frequencies,” according to the Russian commander, Ishtuganov.\n \n\n   \n  Adaptation is never-ending.\n \n\n   \n  In Rubicon’s arsenal is the Molniya drone, a relatively simple UAV largely made of plywood. The second generation of the Molniya (lightning in Russian) carries a payload of up to 7 kilograms (15 pounds) and can fly more than 30 kilometers (19 miles) deep behind the front lines. It can also act as a “mothership” that launches two first-person view (FPV) munitions – and, as CNN discovered in August, has made travel along critical routes much harder.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as the Ukrainians captured a Molniya, they began copying – and improving – the design. They have also developed a new drone –  the FP-2  – that can strike Rubicon command centers at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line.\n \n\n   \n  In the early days of the war, Russian forces were frequently derided in the West for their rigid tactics, poor equipment and mediocre leadership. That has changed.\n \n\n   \n  In a major departure, the Russian military has begun embracing start-up manufacturers such as the Oko Design Bureau in St. Petersburg, which makes two types of drones now widely used in combat. Oko has been sanctioned by the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian military’s embrace of innovation makes Russia “a more dangerous adversary for Ukraine, as well as a much more capable and dangerous military to threaten Europe,” according to a new analysis by the Special Competitive Studies Project, a US think-tank.\n \n\n   \n  The world envisioned by Rubicon and its backers “will soon have swarms of autonomous drones that can overwhelm adversaries’ defenses, microdrones that are difficult to identify or stop, and drones that mimic birds, bugs, or other wildlife,” said military  analyst Dara Massicot .\n \n\n   \n  Drone warfare – and anti-drone electronic warfare - is evolving at an almost weekly pace as the price of survival.\n \n\n   \n  “Experts are fond of saying that armies shape war. But war shapes armies, as well,” Massicot said.\n \n\n   \n  In the forests of Sumy in northern Ukraine, that translates to what Vyacheslav, the commander of the drone unit, as an endless routine.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s systematic work: detection, destruction, detection, destruction.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/washington-bird-flu-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:36:00-05:00","title":"Washington Resident Dies of Complications from Bird Flu Strain Never Before Reported in Humans","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Washington resident died from complications of a rare H5N5 bird flu strain, the first such human case in the U.S. in nine months and only the second human death from the virus.

in humans \n       \n  By Katherine Dillinger, Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:36 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Washington resident died of complications from an infection with a bird flu strain never before reported in humans, the state Department of Health said on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The patient was an older adult with underlying health conditions who had been hospitalized and undergoing treatment for infection with H5N5 avian influenza.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months and only the second reported human death from the virus in the United States, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.\n \n\n   \n  Officials continue to monitor others who were in close contact with the person, but no one else has tested positive for bird flu, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.\n \n\n   \n  “The person had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds,” the Washington State Department of Health said in  a statement . “DOH sampling identified avian influenza virus in the environment of the flock, making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”\n \n\n   \n  Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.\n \n\n   \n  Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the outbreak, according to the CDC. Another elderly person with underlying conditions died in January after a bird flu infection.\n \n\n   \n  Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.  Officials also advise using caution when cleaning bird feeders or other areas exposed to bird feces. Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington health department also recommends flu shots for anyone who may come into contact with domestic or wild birds. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/ukraine-war-trump-plan-zelensky-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:17:00Z","title":"Zelensky Warns of 'Difficult Moment in History' After Trump Gives Ukraine Days to Accept His Plan to End War","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has presented Ukraine with a 28-point peace plan that demands significant concessions, including territorial withdrawals, military downsizing, and a pledge not to join NATO, which Ukraine sees as a threat to its sovereignty.

Ukraine days to accept his plan to end war \n       \n  By Svitlana Vlasova, Catherine Nicholls and Kara Fox, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:17 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his plan – widely seen as favoring Russia – to end the war, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country faced “one of the most difficult moments” in its history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines. But Thursday is it,” the US president said in a radio interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan put forward by Trump  puts pressure  on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands.\n \n\n   \n  It was characterized by Zelensky during a video address to the nation on Friday as presenting Ukraine with a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from the Oval Office later in the day, Trump said he was confident the plan was a “way of getting peace” but said it still needed Zelensky’s approval. However, he suggested Zelensky had little choice but to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “He’ll have to like it. And if he doesn’t like it then they should just keep fighting I guess,” Trump told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a security council briefing he had received the US proposal and that he believed it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian president said he was ready to “show the flexibility” that was agreed upon during the  summit  with Trump in Alaska this August, but added that Russia had not “substantively” discussed the deal with the US.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A very difficult choice’\n \n\n   \n  In his video address, Zelensky said, “The pressure on Ukraine is now at its most intense. Ukraine may now face a very difficult choice: either the loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner, or 28 difficult points, or an extremely harsh winter.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine would “work calmly” and quickly with the US and its partners towards an end to the war, Zelensky said. Zelensky spoke with US Vice President JD Vance on Friday about the plan.\n \n\n   \n  A number of European leaders have spoken out in support of Ukraine since the details of Trump’s proposal were released, vowing to stand by Kyiv and insisting that no decisions should be made about the fate of the country without its input.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the EU appears to have been left largely out in the cold, though German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he and Trump discussed the US plan in a phone call Friday and “agreed on the next steps at the advisers’ level.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint call with Zelensky earlier Friday, Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer “agreed to continue to pursue the goal of safeguarding vital European and Ukrainian interests in the long term,” according to the German government.\n \n\n   \n  This includes “ensuring that the line of contact is the starting point for an understanding and that the Ukrainian armed forces remain capable of effectively defending Ukraine’s sovereignty,” it said in a statement, differing from the US proposal which calls for Ukraine to withdraw from some of its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a  post on X  that European leaders would meet on Saturday on the margins of the G20 summit in Johannesburg to discuss the proposal.\n \n\n   \n  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the discussion at G20 would focus on “how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is only one country around the G20 table that is not calling for a ceasefire, and one country that is deploying a barrage of drones and missiles to destroy livelihoods and murder innocent civilians,” Starmer said. “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky: I will not betray Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears to be giving Russia  almost everything it wants , with much of the text resembling the maximalist positions Moscow held during talks in Istanbul in 2022, shortly after the invasion and when its forces held more of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Like the proposal the Trump administration crafted which led to the  ceasefire in Gaza , the Ukraine  plan  reads as bullet-pointed list, laying out commitments each side would make in order to drive a lasting end to the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukraine plan – which has been seen by CNN – calls for a halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by the US president. The draft plan’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would have Russia-occupied Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States,” a previous red line for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of eastern Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel and calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days – something that would be extremely challenging to organize.\n \n\n   \n  It also outlines a return of Russia into the global economy, including the lifting of sanctions and an invitation to rejoin the G8.\n \n\n   \n  In the Fox News interview on Friday, Trump said that Putin is “not looking for more war” and is “taking punishment,” despite the plan appearing to offer major concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said that he would work around the clock to find a path forward on the plan, while saying he would not betray his country.\n \n\n   \n  “I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will offer alternatives, but we will definitely not give the enemy any reason to say that Ukraine does not want peace, that it is disrupting the process, and that Ukraine is not ready for diplomacy,” Zelensky continued.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.

But it was still remarkable – especially coming from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Reporters kept peppering the two men with questions pointing to their differences and the awful things they’d said about one another.\n \n\n   \n  But the two kept batting away the chance to throw down, emphasizing their common ground.\n \n\n   \n  Among Trump’s comments:\n \n\n   \n  When a reporter noted Trump had threatened to cut funding to New York City if Mamdani were elected, the president suggested that he’ll play that card if he needs to. But he also downplayed the possibility.\n \n\n   \n  “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The compliments were largely flowing from Trump to Mamdani. But Mamdani clearly held his fire on Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than litigate differences with Trump, he regularly brought things right back to his pet issue: affordability.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about having said the US government was complicit in an alleged Israeli genocide in Gaza, Mamdani didn’t back away, but he quickly pivoted to affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Towards the end, a reporter asked if New York City loved Trump. Mamdani wouldn’t go that far, but he did do Trump a solid.\n \n\n   \n  “I can tell you that there were more New Yorkers who voted for President Trump in the most recent presidential election because of that focus on cost of living,” Mamdani said, “and I’m looking forward to working together to deliver on that affordability agenda.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump kept playing defense for Mamdani\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t just that the two men said nice things about one another. It almost seemed like Trump was playing defense for his new buddy.\n \n\n   \n  When a reporter asked Mamdani about having previously labeled Trump a “fascist,” Trump basically gave him permission to say such things.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s ok. You can just say yes,” Trump said. “That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining.”\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, when it was noted that Mamdani had called Trump a despot, Trump volunteered: “I’ve been called much worse than a despot.”\n \n\n   \n  When a reporter asked about Mamdani having criticized Trump’s deportation operations, Trump suggested it wasn’t a big part of their conversation. This despite deportations having been perhaps Trump’s overriding concern in New York City for much of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “He doesn’t want to see crime, and I don’t want to see crime,” Trump said. “And I have very little doubt that we’re not gonna get along on that issue.”\n \n\n   \n    Game recognizes game\n \n\n   \n  So why the love fest?\n \n\n   \n  It seems to have boiled down to something we’ve seen with Trump before. Even when he disagrees with somebody politically, he seems to respect political fortitude and winners. And right now, Mamdani is a winner.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani is also clearly a gifted politician who is succeeding in an area of the country that Trump holds near and dear. That Trump would appreciate a good-looking, talented pol from Queens probably shouldn’t be too shocking.\n \n\n   \n  And to the extent there was a political calculation here, it’s possible the White House didn’t really want to get into it with Mamdani right now. After all, this is a candidate who was so successful on precisely the issue on which Trump is really struggling right now: affordability and cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe getting into it with Mamdani – knowing Mamdani has such message discipline – was deemed a risk.\n \n\n   \n    But Trump undercut a major GOP strategy\n \n\n   \n  But the buddy-buddy scene does come at a potential cost politically.\n \n\n   \n  The scene was a far cry from what many anticipated – and how Republicans billed the event.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday, “because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance joked that he “might have a stomach bug” to avoid meeting Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida late Friday morning called Mamdani a “literal communist” and predicted he was “ on his way to the White House to be schooled by President Trump .”\n \n\n   \n  Or not.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, it’s interesting that this is not at all what we got. But it’s also rather puzzling.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Republicans have spent weeks and  even months  suggesting they were preparing to tie Democrats far and wide to Mamdani’s politics. Democrats also seemed to fear this, judging by how reluctant some of them were to endorse him.\n \n\n   \n  This was the GOP’s first big opportunity to drive that message – to set up this contrast between Trump’s agenda and the purported communism that has infected the national Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  Trump trampled all over that strategy.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the GOP will abandon it outright, but it kind of undercuts it when you’ve got Trump on video next to Mamdani emphasizing their common ground and suggesting conservatives might be pleasantly surprised by the guy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump even rejected a common GOP attack line that Mamdani is a “jihadist.” He was asked if he agreed with New York GOP gubernatorial candidate  Rep. Elise Stefanik saying that , and he said, “No, I don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s out there campaigning,” Trump said, “and you say things sometimes in a campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  It seems Trump doesn’t want everyone to take the GOP’s attacks on Mamdani that seriously.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the most interesting question now is whether any conservatives criticize Trump for giving this supposed communist jihadist a total and complete pass.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/marimar-martinez-shooting-case-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"21:00:00-21:59","title":"Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marimar Martinez, a U.S. citizen and teaching assistant, was accused of ramming a Customs and Border Protection agent’s vehicle in Chicago during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Border Patrol agent fell apart \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Omar Jimenez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Even with a federal indictment hanging over her, claiming she had been a threat to law enforcement, Marimar Martinez was confident she could eventually prove her innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the truth,” Martinez told CNN Friday in an exclusive interview. “I know what really happened that day.”\n \n\n   \n  After an  extraordinary reversal by federal prosecutors  in one of the most high-profile cases connected to  Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago , a judge dismissed charges Thursday against Martinez, a United States citizen who was accused of ramming the vehicle of a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago before he shot her several times.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came after she repeatedly raised concerns about the handling of the investigation, including the revelation the vehicle of the Border Patrol agent who shot Martinez was moved  1,000 miles away  after the incident and text messages showing the agent  apparently bragging  about the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been  accused  of “aggressively and erratically” pursuing CBP agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city. The charging complaint says Exum then stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez – shots the Department of Homeland Security called “defensive.” Martinez had pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the courtroom, the judge noted the government’s case included omissions  that caused her to tread carefully  as Martinez’s defense attorney alleged it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Outside the courtroom, the high-profile case garnered public scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Christopher Parente – himself a former federal prosecutor – believes a rush by the Trump administration to have a meme-ready example of dangerous protest activity forced the US Attorney’s Office to push a weak case too far.\n \n\n   \n  “She never would have been charged under the old system because they would have found out right away that this case is garbage,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s decision came hours after federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charges against both Martinez and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz.\n \n\n   \n  The US Attorney’s Office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz,” spokesperson Joseph Fitzpatrick said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente commended the Trump-appointed US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Andrew Boutros, for not moving forward with the case despite what was likely enormous pressure.\n \n\n   \n  “That took incredible guts,” Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts told CNN the move was likely the result of a series of questionable claims from the federal government in court and a calculation over whether it can be proven at trial that the gunshots were justified.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the investigation and how experts say the government’s case fell apart:\n \n\n   \n    Apparent bragging text messages provide insight\n \n\n   \n  Text messages displayed in court earlier this month were likely key in the prosecution’s decision to move to dismiss charges, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Exum appeared to brag to fellow agents about his marksmanship after he repeatedly shot Martinez following a collision between their vehicles, the messages revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Boasting about the shots would look bad to a jury, Jackson said. Had the case moved forward, the government would have needed to justify every shot he took and prove there was immediate danger and proportionate force.\n \n\n   \n  Exum sent an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum said in the next text.\n \n\n   \n  Parente pointed to the messages as an indication Exum understood the high public scrutiny of the case.\n \n\n   \n  When Parente pressed him in court on what he meant, Exum responded he was a firearms instructor. He said, “I take pride in my shooting skills.”\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge MOF is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one up someone wherever possible. It’s unclear what exactly he was responding to because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Parente told CNN he believes most federal agents would be embarrassed to see that kind of bragging about a shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I have never come across an agent like that,” Parente said. “Those people go to work, and they try to do the right thing. They do not want to shoot people ever.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the texts “reflect poorly on the agent,” who would be a key witness at trial. Prosecutors also have to consider the fairness of the case. “Here you have a woman who was shot multiple times, and there were serious questions of whether she had done anything wrong whatsoever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  If the case had moved forward, it likely   would have been unsuccessful, Jackson said. Martinez’s attorney agrees.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no way we were going to lose this trial on the evidence,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Key evidence was moved 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  Hearings in the case included discussion on what the government did with Exum’s car following the collision. The way that piece of key evidence was handled was one of the significant problems with the government’s case, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s defense attorney sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine, where the car may have had repairs.\n \n\n   \n  “That means that the government did not properly handle and maintain evidence. That’s a major problem in the presentation of the case,” Honig said. It needed to be preserved in the exact same condition it was in after the collision, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said it was a major misstep for the federal government that undermined their credibility. In every other case he’s seen where a car was involved in a shooting, the car is taken to be analyzed by law enforcement and experts reconstruct the collision.\n \n\n   \n  “Any evaluation of the trajectory of the damage would go to show what happened. Instead, you take the car away and destroy evidence,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Alexakis expressed skepticism over why Martinez’s car had been kept in Chicago as evidence while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally. “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n  But Alexakis said the government clearly believed the vehicle could be exculpatory evidence; otherwise, it would not have gone through the trouble to preserve records on the car.\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis ordered the government last month to return the SUV to Chicago.\n \n\n   \n    Judge questioned government’s narrative\n \n\n   \n  Of more than two dozen people arrested for impeding or assaulting federal officers or other protest-related offenses amid demonstrations over the federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, none have gone to trial and charges have been dropped against at least nine of them, The  Associated Press  reported. Judges have expressed skepticism over the strength of some cases.\n \n\n   \n  In its initial  press release , the Department of Homeland Security had referred to Martinez and her co-defendant as “domestic terrorists” who had “ambushed” the Border Patrol vehicle on Chicago streets. Martinez says she couldn’t believe the accusations she was facing.\n \n\n   \n  “They were (saying) ‘domestic terrorist,’ that she had a semiautomatic. I was just like, that’s crazy,” Martinez told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In court, Alexakis noted ﻿discrepancies in the government’s case have caused her “to question the narrative being put forward.”\n \n\n   \n  She pointed out the Justice Department had previously said in court the agent took the SUV back to Maine because it was his “personal vehicle,” then stated in a later court filing the car is part of an official Border Patrol fleet.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted she had not previously been told a mechanic had worked on the car, and the government has given at least two different accounts of who approved the car’s removal to Maine.\n \n\n   \n  She acknowledged the government version of events may turn out to be true, “but I can’t accept that possibility at this juncture,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been serious questions raised about the truthfulness of the statements made by the Border Patrol agent who shot Ms. Martinez and …about the extent to which she could get a fair trial when the Department of Homeland Security was using her case to make inflammatory public claims about the level of resistance to Operation Midway Blitz,” Northwestern law professor Paul Gowder told CNN. “Dismissing the case was the right thing to do with that kind of cloud over it.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Thursday restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DOJ for further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Along with the physical scars that wrapped around Martinez from her arms to her legs, the mental trauma is another reminder of that painful day, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a survivor,” Martinez said. “I don’t want to remember that day. You’re laying there at night and you’re just thinking about it, like, ‘what’s gonna happen?’ It’s really emotional to me.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, who works as a teaching assistant, says she now wants to put the case behind her and get back to work.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just so excited to go back with my students, the parents. They were so supportive,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez says she will be happy to get her normal life back.\n \n\n   \n  “People are like, ‘oh, you just want to be the victim,’” she said. “I’m not the victim. I’m actually a survivor from all of this injustice that’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/james-comey-wants-indictment-dismissed-lindsey-halligan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00Z","title":"James Comey asks for his indictment be dismissed over Lindsey Halligan’s grand jury revelation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Comey’s legal team is requesting the dismissal of criminal charges against him, arguing that the final indictment was never approved by the full grand jury.

Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:44 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey are asking a federal judge to dismiss the charges against him because, they say, a grand jury  never approved  the final indictment in the case.\n \n\n   \n  The  motion to dismiss  comes after prosecutors, including interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, said in court this week that the indictment — which omitted a count that the grand jury rejected — was not seen in its final form by all grand jurors.\n \n\n   \n  “The grand jury voted to reject the only indictment that the government presented to it,” Comey’s attorneys wrote in Friday’s filing. “Instead of presenting the grand jury with a revised indictment, Ms. Halligan signed a new two count indictment that the grand jury had never seen or voted on.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s team is asking the judge to toss the case by as soon as Monday because of the “flagrant nature of the government’s misconduct during the grand jury process.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because at least 12 jurors did not ‘approve the actual indictment,’ there is no valid indictment of Mr. Comey,” defense attorneys said in their filing Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The motion could set the stage for another dramatic week in the Comey case before courts break for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  The new defense request compiles in one place nearly every grievance a magistrate judge and Comey’s team have compiled regarding the belief the Justice Department has acted inappropriately by charging Comey.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, the lead federal prosecutor in Comey’s criminal case said in court earlier this week that a full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment brought against him, but she reversed course in a brief filed Thursday saying there were  no mistakes  in how the indictment was handled in September.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan said part of the transcript from the September 25 hearing, when a magistrate judge in Alexandria, Virginia, was notified of the grand jury’s vote to approve charges against the ex-FBI director, “conclusively refutes” any suggestion that a problem exists with that part of the case.\n \n\n   \n  Of  prosecutors’ efforts to revise the prosecutors’ prior statements,  Comey’s attorneys wrote  their claims contradict “numerous other representations that the government has made to this Court.”\n \n\n   \n  Their arguments, defense attorneys added, “rests on an erroneous overreading of an ambiguous exchange between the grand jury foreperson and the magistrate judge.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate filing Friday, Comey’s team of attorneys also argued that a magistrate judge’s decision to turn over grand jury materials to the defense should remain in place despite prosecutors’ efforts to thwart it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge presiding over Comey’s case paused the magistrate judge’s decision to allow prosecutors to file an objection, which they did earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  In the original ruling, the magistrate judge found “the record points to a disturbing pattern of  profound investigative missteps ” in his ruling for prosecutors to hand over the grand jury material.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys say that the prosecutors’ arguments for why the material should not be released to them amounts to allowing the house to “burn down simply because they were not expecting the fire department to show up.”\n \n\n   \n  They added that the judge’s “order directing the government to disclose the grand jury materials was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.”\n \n\n   \n  “He found that ‘particularized and factually based grounds exist to support the proposition that irregularities in the grand jury proceedings may create abasis for dismissal of the indictment,’” Comey’s attorneys wrote, citing the magistrate judge’s opinion.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys have said there are several glaring issues with how

President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a friendly and productive meeting in the Oval Office, despite their ideological differences. The conversation centered on shared values such as affordability, public safety, and the future of New York City. Trump expressed personal admiration for Mamdani, calling him a 'rational person' and openly stating he would be comfortable living in NYC. This marks a departure from earlier threats—such as pulling federal funds or calling Mamdani a 'communist'—and reflects a strategic alignment that benefits both parties: Mamdani gains access to crucial federal funding and political legitimacy, while Trump gains credibility with a cross-section of voters, especially those concerned about economic issues. The meeting also saw Trump publicly defending Mamdani against criticism from GOP figures like Elise Stefanik, signaling a softening of rhetoric on immigration and foreign policy. The event underscores how shared political goals and city-based values can overcome partisan divides, offering a model for bipartisan cooperation in a polarized political landscape.","keyTakeAways":["Trump and Zohran Mamdani, despite ideological differences, engaged in a friendly, productive meeting in the Oval Office, signaling a significant softening in their political relationship.","Their shared focus on affordability, energy costs, public safety, and peace in the Middle East created common ground, especially in a context where public dissatisfaction with the economy is high.","The meeting demonstrated mutual political utility: Mamdani gains access to federal funding and credibility with the White House, while Trump benefits from public support and cross-party appeal in New York.","Trump acknowledged Mamdani’s democratic socialist views and expressed personal openness to living in New York City, indicating a personal and political shift from hostility to respect.","The meeting was framed as a celebration of New York City, with both leaders expressing admiration for the city and its values, suggesting a symbolic and practical realignment in regional politics."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Zohran Mamdani","whatIsThisEntity":"New York City Mayor-elect","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Mamdani represents a shift in political leadership in New York, where a self-described democratic socialist and the first Muslim mayor-elect has emerged as a significant figure in a city traditionally aligned with conservative politics.

That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining,” Trump told his guest, laughing it off as he playfully tapped Mamdani on the arm.\n \n\n   \n   That collegial interaction  was nearly unthinkable in the lead-up to the meeting as both sides postured, but the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist made clear their conversation was a productive one – friendly, even.\n \n\n   \n  “The better he does, the happier I am,” Trump said of the mayor-elect, later expressing openness to living in Mamdani’s New York City.\n \n\n   \n  During the mayoral campaign, the president urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee, because he’d have a better shot at defeating Mamdani. The president had threatened to pull federal funding from New York if Mamdani won, suggested openness to sending in the National Guard and threatened to arrest the mayor-elect, whom he’s repeatedly called him a “communist.” (Mamdani  has said  he is not a communist).\n \n\n   \n  But asked Friday if he would feel comfortable living in New York City, Trump said, “I really would – especially after the meeting, absolutely,” adding, “We agree on a lot more than I really thought.”\n \n\n   \n  Their post-meeting press engagement underscored that both Trump and Mamdani recognize the political utility of each other’s strengths, with each citing the New York City crossover voters who backed Mamdani earlier this month and Trump in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signaled respect for Mamdani’s overwhelming victory – he won more than 50% of the vote – built on a focus on working-class issues and promises to restore affordability to the nation’s most populous city. That’s a topic where the president could use a boost – a  Fox News poll  released this week showed 76% of voters have a negative view of the economy, a finding that sends loud warning signs to Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also in Mamdani’s best interests to have a working relationship with the White House. New York City’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget is counting on $7.4 billion in federal funding,  according to  the state comptroller.\n \n\n   \n  Along with affordability, Trump and Mamdani indicated they were able to find common ground on issues like energy costs, public safety and peace in the Middle East – a softening, rhetorically at least, of their division over immigration enforcement and the Israel-Hamas war.\n \n\n   \n  The stagecraft of the meeting was notable – Trump and Mamdani met privately for just over half an hour before reporters were invited into the Oval Office. During that time, Mamdani said, the two admired a portrait of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Cabinet Room, with Mamdani taking a picture next to it.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other meetings with his global counterparts where the two leaders sit on equal footing in cushioned yellow chairs, Trump sat behind his desk as Mamdani stood up, positioned slightly behind him.\n \n\n   \n  But the two were all smiles throughout, with Trump even siding with the soon-to-be first Muslim mayor of New York over one of his GOP allies, Rep. Elise Stefanik, who’d called Mamdani a “jihadist.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s out there campaigning and you say things sometimes in a campaign,” Trump said of Stefanik, who’s running for governor of New York. “I met with a man who’s a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see New York be great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik responded  soon after on X : “We all want NYC to succeed. But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the meeting, Mamdani sought counsel from other top Democratic officials who have navigated their own relationships with Trump, spending Thursday holding calls with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss how to approach it and how best to communicate with Trump, according to an aide to Mamdani’s transition team.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s meeting, Mamdani said, “focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump expressed confidence that Mamdani can do a good job as he prepares to take office on January 1 – and impress across the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-guidance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:32:00Z","title":"RFK Jr. says he personally directed CDC’s new guidance on vaccines and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Health Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy Jr.  personally directed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  update its website  to contradict its longtime guidance that vaccines don’t cause autism, he told The New York Times in an  interview  published Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments provide clarity into who directed the CDC’s website change, after many current and former staffers at the agency were surprised to see new published guidance on Wednesday that defies scientific consensus. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has upended the public health agencies he oversees and pushed for and enacted changes that have unsettled much of the medical community, which sees his policies as harmful for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “The whole thing about ‘vaccines have been tested and there’s been this determination made,’ is just a lie,” Kennedy said in the interview, which was conducted Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC’s “vaccine safety” page now claims that the statement “vaccines do not cause autism” is not based on evidence because it doesn’t rule out the possibility that infant vaccines are linked to the disorder. The page also has been updated to suggest that health officials have ignored studies showing a potential link.\n \n\n   \n  Public health researchers and advocates strongly refute the updated website, saying it misleads the public by exploiting the fact that the scientific method can’t satisfy a demand to prove a negative. They note that scientists have thoroughly explored potential links between vaccines and autism in rigorous research spanning decades, all pointing to the same conclusion that vaccines don’t cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday. “This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines. All this research has determined that there is no link between autism and vaccines.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement, acknowledged to The New York Times the existence of studies showing no link to autism from the mercury-based preservative thimerosal or from the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. But he told the newspaper there are still gaps in vaccine safety science and a need for more research.\n \n\n   \n  The move creates another disagreement between the health secretary and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee. During his confirmation process, Kennedy pledged to Cassidy he would leave the statement that vaccines do not cause autism on the CDC website. The statement remains on the website but with a disclaimer that it was left there because of their agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy told The New York Times he talked to Cassidy about the updated website and that Cassidy disagreed with the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism,” Cassidy posted on X on Thursday. “Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n  The updated website comes as Kennedy has taken  other steps  as health secretary that sow doubt in immunizations. He has  pulled $500 million for their development , ousted and replaced every member of a federal  vaccine advisory committee  and  pledged to overhaul a federal program  for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also  fired former CDC Director Susan Monarez  less than a month into her tenure after they clashed over vaccine policy.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Sean O’Leary, head of the infectious diseases committee at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told reporters in a briefing Thursday that the CDC’s website update was perpetuating a lie.\n \n\n   \n  “This is madness,” he said. “Vaccines do not cause autism, and unfortunately, we can no longer trust health-related information coming from our government.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Health and Human Services, which didn’t make Kennedy available for an interview with The Associated Press this week, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/texas-supreme-court-congressional-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Pauses Lower Court Order That Blocked Texas’ New Congressional Maps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has paused a federal lower court order that blocked Texas’s new congressional redistricting maps, which were criticized as potentially constituting racial gerrymandering.

November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Texas urged the Supreme Court on Friday to boost President Donald Trump’s effort to help Republicans maintain control of Congress,   asking the justices to  review a federal court ruling  that found the state’s new map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after the appeal was filed, Justice Samuel Alito temporarily blocked  the lower court ruling that barred Texas  from using the congressional maps, putting the fast-moving appeal on pause while the Supreme Court considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s emergency appeal could have enormous consequences for next year’s midterm elections, which will determine control of the House for the final two years of Trump’s presidency. A Democratic majority would likely unleash a string of investigations aimed at the administration and possibly block most of the president’s legislative agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Texas asked the Supreme Court to block the lower court ruling by December 1. It also urged the court to quickly step into the case on the merits now and expedite its review.\n \n\n   \n  The state said the lower court order had caused “chaos” in its elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Campaigning had already begun, candidates had already gathered signatures and filed applications to appear on the ballot under the 2025 map, and early voting for the March 3, 2026, primary was only 91 days away,” Texas officials told the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Alito asked the groups that challenged Texas’ maps to respond to the emergency appeal by Monday evening, suggesting he is eager to move the high-profile case at a fast pace. Alito, a conservative, handles appeals rising from courts within the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Alito will likely refer the case to the full court soon, and the “administrative” order he signed Friday night will remain in place only until all nine justices review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly called for red states to redraw districts and increase the number of GOP-held seats for political reasons. That has   set off an unusual mid-decade   arms race between red and blue states to redraw lines in order to maximize each party’s chances in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  At issue is whether Texas lawmakers violated the Constitution when they redrew the state’s congressional boundaries   based on a Trump Justice Department   letter urging the state to change the racial compositions of four of those districts. In a scathing opinion on Tuesday, a federal court found that focus on race when drawing the lines likely violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n \n\n   \n  The new Texas map would likely flip five Democratic-held House seats to Republican next year. House Republicans currently hold a narrow three-seat majority.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court has long been reticent to engage in these disputes. In 2019, the court extricated itself from litigation over partisan gerrymandering – ruling that those were political rather than legal matters. If Texas had justified its new map based on politics, the state would almost certainly have been able to defend the changes in federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  Texas told the Supreme Court in its emergency appeal Friday that politics, not race, drove the new maps.\n \n\n   \n  “This summer, the Texas Legislature did what legislatures do: politics,” the state told the high court.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement minutes after the state filed its appeal, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton reinforced the point.\n \n\n   \n  “Texas engaged in partisan redistricting solely to secure more Republican seats in Congress and thereby better represent our state and Texans,” Paxton said. “For years, Democrats have aggressively gerrymandered their states and only cry foul and hurl baseless ‘racism’ accusations because they are losing.”\n \n\n   \n  But the Supreme Court won’t have much, if any, room to maneuver around claims of racial gerrymander in the Texas case. The justices will have to decide on a relatively short fuse whether to temporarily block the lower court order that threw out the state’s new boundaries or leave that ruling in place.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional hopefuls in Texas must declare their candidacy by December 8. The state’s primaries are set for March.\n \n\n   \n  And those looming deadlines may prompt a majority of the court to decide that it’s too close to the election for federal courts to be wading into the Texas morass. Under a 2006 decision, the justices have warned federal courts to avoid making last-minute changes to the status quo of voting rules before an election. If the court decides that principle applies, then it would likely side with Texas – allowing the redrawn map to take effect for next year’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  Texas leaned heavily into that argument in its briefing Friday, asserting that it was too late – too close to the election – for federal courts to get involved.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, nominated to the bench by Trump during his first term, eviscerated the letter the Justice Department sent to Texas in July urging the redistricting.   That letter   warned of potential legal action over the state’s map because of what it called “unconstitutional” coalition districts, or districts with a non-White majority but where no single racial group makes up a majority.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s challenging to unpack the DOJ letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,” Brown wrote. “The gist of the letter, though, is that DOJ is urging Texas to change the racial compositions” of four districts.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, cited the DOJ letter when he added redistricting to the agenda of a special legislative session. By doing so, “the governor explicitly directed the legislature to draw a new US House map to resolve DOJ’s concerns,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “In other words, the governor explicitly directed the legislature to redistrict based on race,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  States may consider race when they redraw congressional lines – usually every decade following the census – but Supreme Court precedent bars race from being the predominant factor in that effort.\n \n\n   \n  “When given an opportunity to publicly proclaim that his motivation for adding redistricting to the legislative agenda was solely to improve Republicans’ electoral prospects at President Trump’s request, the governor denied any such motivation,” Brown wrote. “Instead, the governor expressly stated that his predominant motivation was racial.”\n \n\n   \n  The special three-judge court that heard the election case split 2-1, with an Obama appointee joining Brown and a nominee of President Ronald Reagan dissenting.\n \n\n   \n  The legal battles over efforts by Republicans and Democrats to enact rare, mid-decade congressional maps will continue to play out in coming weeks. Last week, the Justice Department sued officials in California over new maps meant to give Democrats in the Golden State an edge next year. A court is set to hear arguments in that case next month.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is considering a separate case dealing with congressional districts in Louisiana and the creation of a second Black-majority district there to comply with a federal court order. That case threatens to unwind how states, courts and civil rights groups have viewed the role of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to prevent racial discrimination in redistricting. It may also jeopardize majority-Black and heavily Democratic seats in several other states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  In the Texas case, Brown ordered the state to use the same map it drew after the 2020 census. Of the state’s 38 House seats, 25 are held by Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how quickly the court will decide the case. So far this year, in non-argued emergency cases, the court has taken an average of about three weeks to resolve appeals dealing with the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  US Circuit Judge Jerry Smith issued a sprawling dissent on Wednesday that repeatedly attacked Brown’s handling of the case. Smith argued that the majority opinion was “replete with legal and factual error, and accompanied by naked procedural abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  “If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an ‘F,’” Smith wrote. “Judge Brown is an unskilled magician. The audience knows what is coming next.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/irs-ice-data-sharing-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:16:00-05:00","title":"Federal judge blocks IRS from sharing information to help ICE with deportations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, blocked the IRS from sharing home addresses of taxpayers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of a mass deportation effort.

deportations \n       \n  By Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:16 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Friday  blocked the IRS  from giving ICE the home addresses of taxpayers who might be undocumented immigrants — dealing a blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling is a significant victory for immigrant-rights group and liberal activists who are trying to resist the mass deportations that President Donald Trump has made a top priority for the first year of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration can appeal the decision, and it has a decent track record this year of overturning lower-court losses. A separate federal judge in a related case  previously declined  to block the data-sharing deal between Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Court records indicate that the IRS has provided ICE with information about 47,000 potentially undocumented taxpayers so far as part of the controversial data-sharing deal, a fraction of what the Trump administration requested. The Department of Homeland Security has said it wants this information to find people who came to the US illegally and have already been ordered by a judge to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS rebuffed, and ultimately rejected, attempts to get information on  millions  of suspected undocumented immigrants with existing deportation orders. These disagreements created  months of tension  between IRS leadership and the White House, leading to the  resignation  and  ouster  of multiple IRS commissioners this year including Billy Long, a Trump loyalist.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the IRS and Treasury Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in her  94-page ruling  Friday that the data-sharing program was unlawful for several reasons, including because it violated legal requirements to keep sensitive taxpayer information private except for very strict exceptions, regardless of their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “Plaintiffs have shown that the IRS’s disclosure of confidential taxpayer address information to ICE was contrary to law because it did not comply with certain requirements in (the) Internal Revenue Code,” wrote Kollar-Kotelly, a Bill Clinton appointee.\n \n\n   \n  An order blocking the program was necessary because undocumented taxpayers were suffering irreparable harm, she  said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge rejected many of the Justice Department’s arguments for why the program was legal, concluding, among other things, that certain assertions were not credible. For instance, DOJ officials claimed that one single ICE agent was personally overseeing tens of thousands of investigations that might lead to criminal prosecutions and deportations.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court finds it unlikely that a single individual could be ‘personally and directly engaged’ in approximately 47,000 criminal matters, let alone 1.28 million of them, as ICE represented to the IRS,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This case was brought by the Center for Taxpayer Rights, a nonpartisan nonprofit that said the policy was hurting its clients at a low-income clinic, including undocumented immigrants. Millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes each year — for decades, they have been encouraged to register with the IRS and pay what they owe, with assurances that their private information would stay confidential except for extremely rare cases.\n \n\n   \n  Other anti-Trump groups involved in the lawsuit praised the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an important win for millions of people in America whose information has been threatened by the Trump-Vance administration… the privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort,” Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/business/stock-market-dow","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:27:00Z","title":"What on Earth Just Happened to the Stock Market?

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%.\n \n\n   \n  The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get  a December rate cut , after all.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?\n \n\n   \n  At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting:\n \n\n   \n  Phew. Right?\n \n\n   \n  Wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Traders at first  cheered Thursday morning , sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday.\n \n\n   \n  Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions.\n \n\n   \n  “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.\n \n\n   \n  By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat.  Bitcoin  dropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022.\n \n\n   \n    So, what’s next?\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also looked more closely at a  particularly confusing jobs report  and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull.\n \n\n   \n  Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all.\n \n\n   \n  So here we are on Friday, right back where we started.  CNN’s Fear and Greed Index  is in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it?\n \n\n   \n  Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/florida-deputy-killed-eviction-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00Z","title":"Florida eviction turns deadly as a deputy is killed, shooter and two others wounded","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Florida sheriff’s deputy, Terri Mashkow, was fatally shot while attempting to serve an eviction notice in the Bermuda Club neighborhood near Vero Beach.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least one Israeli was killed and three injured in a ramming and stabbing attack at a junction in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, according to Israeli emergency services.\n \n\n   \n  The group was attacked in a vehicle ramming and stabbing incident at Gush Etzion Junction, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n \n\n   \n  One man was killed at the scene as a result of a “severe stab wound,” according to Elad Pas, a paramedic with Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s emergency response service. One woman was in serious condition after the attack, Pas said, while two more were in moderate condition.\n \n\n   \n  Two “terrorists” were “eliminated” by IDF soldiers at the scene of the attack, the military said.\n \n\n   \n  “Several explosive materials were found in the vehicle used by the terrorists, and are currently being neutralized by Israel Border Police bomb disposal specialists,” the IDF wrote in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid called the attack “severe,” saying that it took “the life of a young Israeli citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  “I offer my support to the IDF and the security forces in their efforts to restore security and eradicate terrorism. I send warm condolences to the family of the murdered victim and wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured,” Lapid said.\n \n\n   \n  Stabbing and ramming attacks by Palestinian militants in Israel, Jerusalem and the West Bank are not uncommon, taking place at checkpoints, transit hubs and other busy public areas with some regularity.\n \n\n   \n  Violence in the West Bank has also surged recently. A United Nations report released earlier this month found that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians and activists have been assaulted or detained as they attempted to peacefully harvest olives. Last week, a mosque in the West Bank was torched and sprayed with graffiti. On Monday, dozens of Israeli settlers set Palestinian vehicles and homes on fire in a village in the West Bank, after Israeli forces tore down settlers’ illegal outpost structures in the area.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad praised Tuesday’s attack, saying that it was “in response to the ongoing crimes committed by settler gangs and the occupation army against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The militant group did not claim responsibility for the attack, but said that it affirmed “our people’s determination to confront policies of oppression and abuse by all available means.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas also praised the attack, though did not claim responsibility for it, calling it “an inevitable outcome” of Israel’s “persistence in its aggression against our people, our land, and our holy sites.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/entertainment/dolly-parton-skips-events-health-challenges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:42:00-05:00","title":"Dolly Parton Skips Events as She Further Deals with 'Health Challenges'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dolly Parton has missed two major events — her induction into the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions’ Hall of Fame and the Academy Governors Awards — due to ongoing health challenges.

By Dana O’Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:46 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  College athletes will still be prohibited from betting on any sport in which the NCAA sponsors a championship after an eleventh-hour push to rescind a proposed rule change reached the necessary two-thirds threshold.\n \n\n   \n  Facing a 5 p.m. ET Friday deadline and needing 241 schools to submit paperwork preventing college athletes from betting on professional sports, the NCAA reached the necessary two-thirds majority, according to a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “After a procedural 30-day period, two-thirds of Division I member schools have voted to rescind a previously approved rule change that would have allowed student-athletes and athletics department staff members to legally participate in sports betting on professional sports only,” the  NCAA said . “Because sports betting rules are common legislation, the ban on all forms of betting — for sports in which the NCAA sponsors a championship — will remain in place for all three NCAA divisions.”\n \n\n   \n  A source told CNN Sports the NCAA hit 241 teams voting to rescind the rule at 4:30 p.m. ET, 30 minutes before the deadline.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA long had held firm prohibiting gambling on any sport in which it crowned a champion, aiming to prevent anything that could compromise the integrity of the game and stop harassment from bettors. The NCAA also argued that, because of its relationships and friendships with former athletes who turn pro, college players and staff could be privy to inside information that could compromise them.\n \n\n   \n  But citing the growth in legal sports betting nationwide – now permissible in 38 states – and arguing that sports betting was now available to regular college students, the NCAA agreed to change its policy. Toeing the line between endorsing gambling on sports and allowing it, the NCAA argued it was readily available to traditional students and therefore shouldn’t be forbidden for athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, the rule was meant to change on November 1, but when 75% of the cabinet members did not vote in favor, it triggered an automatic 30-day rescission window.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since, sports gambling has come under heightened scrutiny. In the last month,  federal authorities  have arrested two  Major League Baseball  players (Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz), as well as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones – all accused of taking part in separate gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  On the same day the decision was announced permitting wagering on professional sports, the NCAA announced that a former Temple basketball player and two staff members had bet on college and professional games and the player, Hysier Miller, included multiple parlays on his own team. The NCAA permanently banned Miller.\n \n\n   \n  He is now the 14th player from seven different schools to be caught in the crosshairs of gambling activities and banned.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA also recently permanently banned six college basketball players for game-fixing and just this week released a study that found 36% of Division I college basketball players have been subjected to harassment on social media from angry bettors..\n \n\n   \n  The NBA has asked its partner sportsbooks to consider prohibiting prop bets that it has identified as most susceptible to manipulation and NCAA president Charlie Baker has, since last year, asked sportsbooks to remove prop bets for college athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen states have banned prop bets on college athletes. Additionally, the national governing body recently partnered with Genius Sports, which will require sportsbooks to drop wagers on individual performances if they want access to real-time stats during the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments and other championship events.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/media/trump-jimmy-kimmel-abc-carr-quiet-piggy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:30:00Z","title":"Kimmel Makes Trump an Offer After a Week of Attacks on ABC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on late-night television hosts, particularly Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers, criticizing their coverage of political issues and calling them biased or lacking talent.

attacks on ABC \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:10 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  “Every five weeks,” Jimmy Kimmel observed, President Trump “flips out and wants me fired.”\n \n\n   \n  It happened again this week, when the president posted on Truth Social, asking why ABC keeps “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on the air.\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel responded on Thursday night’s show, pointing out that Trump’s post came at 12:49 a.m., “11 minutes after the show ended on the East Coast.”\n \n\n   \n  He said directly to Trump, “Thanks for watching us on TV instead of on YouTube. We appreciate that. And I’ll tell you, it’s viewers like you who keep us on the air, ironically.”\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel, whose contract with ABC is coming due in May, then said, “Mr. President, I admire your tenacity. If you’re watching tonight, which I presume you are, how about this: I’ll go when you go, OK? We’ll be a team. Let’s ride off into the sunset together like Butch Cassidy and the Suntan Kid. And until then, if I may borrow a phrase from you: ‘Quiet, piggy.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s “piggy” remark to a Bloomberg reporter last week garnered widespread outrage this week, as did his insulting comments to ABC News correspondent Mary Bruce on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  One of Bruce’s questions about the government’s Jeffrey Epstein files prompted Trump to criticize her tone, bash ABC as a “crappy company,” and encourage the FCC to revoke the network’s licenses.\n \n\n   \n  Bruce was praised by fellow members of the White House press corps for asking important questions despite the president’s demeaning comments.\n \n\n   \n  After the tense Oval Office exchange, the White House generated a list of grievances against ABC and claimed the news division had decided to “wage war” against Trump and his voters.\n \n\n   \n  ABC and its parent company, Disney, declined to comment, choosing to let the news division’s work speak for itself.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday’s “Good Morning America,” co-host Robin Roberts referenced these “extremely challenging times” and thanked Bruce for “your willingness to ask these types of questions” to those in power.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s latest blast against Kimmel came Wednesday night, shortly after Kimmel talked on air about Trump reversing course and signing the bill compelling the Justice Department to release Epstein materials.\n \n\n   \n  “We are one step closer to answering the question, what did the president know and how old were these women when he knew it,” Kimmel quipped.\n \n\n   \n  Trump wrote that Kimmel has “NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS” and asked, “Why do the TV Syndicates put up with it? Also, totally biased coverage. Get the bum off the air!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel’s ratings are better than Trump thinks, but that’s beside the point. The point is that Trump wants to drive a wedge between Kimmel and local stations, which he called “syndicates.”\n \n\n   \n  Two big owners of ABC-affiliated stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, need Trump’s man in charge of regulating stations, FCC chair Brendan Carr, to approve pending deals.\n \n\n   \n  Both Nexstar and Sinclair yanked Kimmel’s show back in September when Carr denounced Kimmel’s remarks about Charlie Kirk’s suspected killer. The highly unusual blackout spotlighted longstanding tensions between local affiliates and national networks — as well as the affiliates’ limited power.\n \n\n   \n  ABC briefly suspended Kimmel’s show nationwide, but brought it back in a matter of days, leaving Nexstar and Sinclair  little choice  but to resume airing it.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week Carr announced that the FCC will review the relationships between networks and affiliates, though his agency has little power to effect change.\n \n\n   \n  As for Kimmel, he made it sound like he’s grown accustomed to Trump’s angry posts.\n \n\n   \n  “I woke up this morning, I’m in bed, my wife comes out of the bathroom, she’s got her phone,” Kimmel said. “She goes, ‘Um, Trump tweeted you should be fired again.’ I was like, ‘Oh.’ And then I went downstairs and made bagels for the kids.”\n \n\n   \n  He also remarked that “if you got this many threats from a neighbor, you’d have no problem getting a restraining order. The judge would be like, ‘Yeah, sounds like the guy’s nuts.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also recently took out his anger on another late-night comic, NBC’s Seth Meyers; last Saturday Trump said Meyers has “an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome” and “NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!”\n \n\n   \n  Carr reposted Trump’s message on X without any further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meyers brought up Trump’s grievance on Monday’s edition of “Late Night,” remarking that “being attacked by the president this weekend doesn’t make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former President Joe Biden.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/john-bolton-trial-classified-documents","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-05:00","title":"More charges are possible against John Bolton, Justice Department says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, may face additional criminal charges for allegedly sharing classified national defense information during Trump’s first term.

President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser  John Bolton  could face more charges, Justice Department prosecutors suggested at a Friday court hearing in his criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department continues to go through the large amount of documents recovered in the case, including from Bolton’s home in Maryland and his office in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The material, which prosecutors say includes classified information they accuse Bolton of illegally sharing with others during his time in Trump’s first term, must be reviewed by the intelligence community before Bolton’s defense team can have access to it.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, declined to comment on prosecutor’s suggestion that additional charges could come.\n \n\n   \n  Because of this extended process for discovery, no trial has been set in the case and the review alone is expected to last until at least May.\n \n\n   \n  Coming into the hearing, prosecutors and Bolton’s team proposed that all discovery would be produced by late May, but US District Judge Theodore Chuang on Friday appeared frustrated with that plan and ordered prosecutors to speed up production of the documents at the center of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m still having trouble with why we need seven months for this,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Chuang, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, at one point scolded prosecutors for what he viewed as their failure to complete some of the time-intensive work that needs to be done with the US intelligence community in cases involving classified materials.\n \n\n   \n  “If you actually wanted to indict, you’d want to know what the intelligence community actually needs with these,” the judge said at one point.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors pointed to several issues they say have been slowing down their work, including the involvement of a “filter team” to help figure out which material may involve attorney-client privilege.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas Sullivan, the lead prosecutor in the case, told the judge that there was a “voluminous” amount of documents in the case that needed to be sifted through by both his team, the intelligence community and that separate “filter team.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a process that takes time,” Sullivan said. “I can assure the court that we are working with them to review these documents as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Bolton pleaded not guilty last month to eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

James Comer issued subpoenas to two banks, called for a slew of documents from the US Virgin Islands attorney general and solicited advice from Epstein survivors about what the committee should next target. The panel has so far  released  tens of thousands of documents, emails and communications that it received from the Epstein estate that continue to open new lines of investigative inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the committee threatened contempt of Congress if Bill and Hillary Clinton did not comply with their subpoenas and quickly schedule their depositions. CNN has reached out to the Clintons for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also still want to interview  Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s accomplice. Her attorneys recently told the panel that Maxwell would assert her 5th Amendment rights and would refuse to answer questions, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough review of the federal government’s investigation of Jeffrey Epstein in order to bring transparency for the American people and accountability for survivors,” Comer said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The panel also has its own subpoena to DOJ for all 300 gigabytes of the Epstein files. Sources familiar with the investigation say it is different than  the law recently signed  by President Donald Trump in that the committee’s subpoena does not have any exceptions to it, while the law allows for DOJ to decide if any documents pertaining to an ongoing investigation can be withheld.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources familiar with the investigation said that investigators are looking to expand the subpoenas to banks to over a dozen and are actively expanding the investigation’s witness list, including survivors who want to share their stories, individuals involved in Epstein’s 2008 so-called sweetheart deal, and former Palm Beach officials related to a separate investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “The committee is in a constant state of interviews and talking to people. We’re having conversations regularly with survivors, we’re taking information from them. We’re talking regularly to folks that were in Epstein’s network that knew him,” one of the sources told CNN. “We have an active whistleblower line and people send information to us.”\n \n\n   \n  In a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, congressional staff asked survivors and their attorneys where the committee should look next in its ongoing probe of Epstein. One individual responded that the panel should subpoena Harvard, remarking that the elite school used to be a quintessential “old boys’ club.”\n \n\n   \n  Staff in the room responded positively to the suggestion and affirmed that the panel was in fact willing to look into investigating the university, sources said, though issuing a subpoena is not typically the first step.\n \n\n   \n  The exchange comes as Harvard University is once again embroiled in an Epstein scandal after the Oversight panel released last week tens of thousands of documents that it received from the Epstein estate.\n \n\n   \n  The trove of documents released last week  showed that Larry Summers , Harvard’s former president and one of its most prominent faculty, had a years-long, intimate correspondence and friendship with Epstein. In emails between the years 2013 and 2019, the two men frequently bantered about current events and high-profile figures in elite orbits; at other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers’ romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.\n \n\n   \n  Summers has since resigned from numerous public roles, including board member of OpenAI and Santander and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. In an initial statement, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” about his relationship with Epstein but that he would continue his teaching commitments. Later in the same week, Harvard said Summers would not be finishing the semester as an instructor at the university.\n \n\n   \n  Harvard, which has long had deep ties to Epstein, announced this week that it is launching an investigation not only into Summers’ connection with the pedophile, but also any other university affiliates implicated in last week’s documents release, The Harvard Crimson  first reported .\n \n\n   \n    More subpoenas and interviews to come\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has 30 days to comply with the Epstein files law Trump signed Wednesday, but how exactly the agency will release the files and any potential restrictions are far from clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has separately instructed the Department of Justice to further investigate Epstein’s relationship with a number of high-profile individuals, including Summers.\n \n\n   \n  On the same day that the House voted to release all of the Epstein files, the Oversight panel subpoenaed JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank for Epstein’s financial records as Republicans believe Epstein’s finances provide a whole new wealth of information.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we have just scratched the surface on Epstein,” GOP Rep. Tim Burchett, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, told CNN. “I think we are going to have to dig very deep into his finances and we may never know the full extent to his network.”\n \n\n   \n  Specifically, the Republican-led panel is demanding documents pertaining to a 2019  JPMorgan Chase  internal investigation into Epstein, known as “Project Jeep” that retroactively flagged 4,700 Epstein transactions as suspicious. Epstein held accounts with JPMorgan Chase for approximately two decades until 2013 when the bank reportedly closed all of Epstein’s accounts and he banked with Deutsche Bank from 2013 through potentially late 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “In short, the records sought by this subpoena are critical to further the Committee’s investigation,” Comer wrote in his subpoena letters on November 18.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden  released  a report this week claiming that recently unsealed court records show that JPMorgan Chase “underreported Epstein’s suspicious transactions to the federal government for nearly two decades.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to Wyden’s report, JPMorgan’s Patricia Wexler said in a statement to CNN, “We acted appropriately in filing SARs as early as 2002. The second the government finally made public the sex trafficking details in 2019 — information they clearly had for years — we identified for law enforcement a range of Epstein’s past transactions intended to assist with the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  The Oversight committee also requested a tranche of documents from US Virgin Islands Attorney General Gordon Rhea to further dig into Epstein’s life on his two private islands where he allegedly leveraged his personal and business relationships to negotiate lucrative tax breaks and even pay off local law enforcement, according to the panel’s letter. The committee wants to learn more about USVI’s 2020 law enforcement action against Epstein and the subsequent settlements to the tune of millions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  “The Committee believes that the documents related to Mr. Epstein, his estate, and the USVI litigation will aide its ongoing investigation into Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and the federal government’s investigation into both individuals,” Comer’s subpoena letter states.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Rhea for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Given Epstein’s communication with USVI Governor Kenneth E. Mapp and text messages during a 2019 congressional hearing with Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, the committee argued in its letter to Rhea that there is an “interconnectedness between the USVI and Mr. Epstein.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/brian-walshe-guilty-plea-legal-defense","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"14:51:00-05:00","title":"Brian Walshe Pleads Guilty to Body Disposal; Murder Trial Proceeds with Strategic Defense Move","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a Massachusetts man, pleaded guilty to misleading police and illegally disposing of his wife Ana Walshe’s body in dumpsters, but denies murdering her. The guilty plea, made just before jury selection for the murder trial, is seen as a strategic move to narrow the trial to the central question of whether he caused her death. Walshe faces a first-degree murder charge with a mandatory life sentence, but his attorneys argue he is innocent, relying on claims of self-defense or an accident. Prosecutors allege Walshe had financial motives, including access to life insurance, and engaged in searches about body disposal and decontamination.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:51 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 has admitted he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with the court having chosen the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection was completed on Thursday.  CNN affiliate WCVB  reported 16 panelists had been chosen, 12 of whom will decide the case. The other four will be alternates.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The court has previously indicated that opening statements are slated to begin on December 1.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/state-department-freedom-speech-human-rights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"State Department to identify DEI policies and mass migration as 'human rights infringements'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department, under the Trump administration, is reshaping its annual human rights report to define diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, mass migration, and government funding for abortion medications as 'human rights infringements'.

Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:08 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US State Department will require its diplomats describe enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, alleged facilitation of mass migration, and government funding that supports abortion medications as “human rights infringements” in its next human rights report, a senior State Department official said Thursday, as the Trump administration moves to further align the report with its domestic politics.\n \n\n   \n  The report will also shift focus to “natural rights” like freedom of speech, the official said, in a move likely to target traditional European allies for alleged freedom of speech restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department instructed all embassies and consulates in a diplomatic cable Thursday to begin preparing the congressionally required annual report, which is meant to describe human rights abuses in countries around the world. The official said they are encouraging diplomats to “go out in the field, talk to people, collect data that then informs the report.”\n \n\n   \n  The new requirements further institutionalize changes seen in the  latest report released in August , which covered the 2024 calendar year. They also align with the administration’s domestic priorities.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday the State Department called migration “an existential threat to Western civilization” and said it instructed its diplomats “to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration.”\n \n\n   \n  Top administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have  lambasted European nations  over allegations of free speech backsliding while also meeting with far-right European political figures. At the same time, the administration has also revoked and denied visas for alleged antisemitic speech and comments made about the murder of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\n \n\n   \n  The senior State Department official said Thursday that they “are moving away from group identities, group labels, and focusing on the fact that when a person is persecuted for whatever reason, that is a violation of the moral law.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re making sure that we’re promoting individual freedom not based on some group identity,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The official described a catalogue of “infringements on human rights” that diplomats preparing the report will be required to note.\n \n\n   \n  These include “arrests, administrative penalties, and ‘official investigations or warnings’ for speech; the enforcement of policies like affirmative action of diversity, equity, and inclusion that ‘provide preferential treatment’ to workers on the basis of race, sex, or caste; the facilitation of mass or illegal migration across a country’s territory into other countries;” gender affirming care for minors; and “state subsidization of abortions or abortifacient drugs.” They will also be required to note “the total estimated number of annual abortions.”\n \n\n   \n  “In recent years, new destructive ideologies have given safe harbor to human rights violations. The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked,” State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior State Department official who worked on human rights decried the changes, arguing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio “is abandoning decades of bipartisan U.S leadership on universal human rights, and replacing it with a dangerous theocratic ideology that has more in common with The Handmaid’s Tale than with the Declaration of Independence.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is yet another example of the Trump Administration sacrificing the rights and principles that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and that generations of people around the world looked to for moral inspiration,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest report, which was released in August, was  drastically pared down  from past years. It alleged “significant human rights issues” in allied countries including the United Kingdom, France and Germany over “serious restrictions on freedom of expression.”\n \n\n   \n  That report had been stripped of specific sections of reporting on alleged abuses based on sexual orientation, violence toward women and systemic racial or ethnic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The future report is “really going to reflect what’s going on in the country,” the senior State Department official said.\n \n\n   \n  “For instance, in Western Europe, we see a backsliding of the protection of freedom of expression. So of course, we’re going to prioritize that versus another country that is maybe not curtailing free speech as much,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to Western Europe, we’re not saying that we’re favoring one opposition party or one particular political group. We’re saying all groups, all parties, all people should be able to speak freely, and that includes on the internet. That includes on social media,” the senior State Department official said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “In Europe, the (Digital Services Act) is a regulatory regime that restricts speech online,” the official said, referencing a sweeping EU law that requires Big Tech platforms to take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.\n \n\n   \n  The official noted that the human rights report, formally known as the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, is used “as a tool to change the behavior of governments.”\n \n\n   \n  “When our European friends are restricting free speech, we’ll have a conversation, and if they make changes, we will note that in the future report,” they said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/robert-brooks-death-ny-sentencing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:36:00-05:00","title":"4 guards sentenced in brutal beating death of an incarcerated Black man at New York prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Four prison guards were sentenced in November 2025 for their roles in the fatal beating of Robert Brooks, a Black man, at the Marcy Correctional Facility in upstate New York.

sentenced in brutal beating death of an incarcerated Black man at New York prison \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:36 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Four prison guards involved  in the death of an incarcerated Black man  whose brutal beating at an upstate New York prison last year was captured on body-worn camera videos were each sentenced Friday to prison terms.\n \n\n   \n  The four had  pleaded   guilty  in September, just two weeks before the start of the trial for a group of guards accused in the death of Robert Brooks, who was pummeled while handcuffed at the Marcy Correctional Facility on Dec. 9. The beating of the restrained 43-year-old man triggered outrage and calls for reform.\n \n\n   \n  Nicholas Anzalone and Anthony Farina, who both had faced a top charge of murder before pleading guilty to a lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter, each received 22-year terms. Two more men charged with second-degree manslaughter also pleaded guilty. Michael Mashaw was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, while David Walters got two years, four months to seven years.\n \n\n   \n  Brooks had been serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault since 2017 and was transferred to Marcy from a nearby lockup on the night he was beaten. The videos show Brooks being struck in the chest with a shoe, lifted by his neck and then dropped.\n \n\n   \n  During the hearing, prosecutors read statements from Brooks’ relatives, including his brother, Jared Ricks, who wrote that he hopes the “welcoming committee” shows the four defendants more grace when they arrive in state prison as incarcerated people than they showed his brother,  Syracuse.com reported .\n \n\n   \n  The victim’s son, Robert Brooks Jr., wrote that watching the video of his father’s fatal beating was like watching a horror movie.\n \n\n   \n  “I pray this case teaches others that they can’t treat incarcerated people like animals,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, the special prosecutor in the case, said the two men were not allowed to read their statements themselves due to objections from all four defense attorneys after Fitzpatrick failed to file the required paperwork.\n \n\n   \n  The first plea in the case came last May, when a guard charged with murder pleaded guilty to manslaughter under a deal with prosecutors. Christopher Walrath, who resigned, was sentenced in August to 15 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Another  guard pleaded guilty later in May  to attempted tampering with physical evidence and was sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge.\n \n\n   \n  The trial of three other guards charged with murder and first-degree manslaughter concluded last month with a jury convicting David Kingsley on both counts but acquitting the other two, Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer. Kingsley faces a potential life term when he’s sentenced, while the last guard, Michael Fisher, is scheduled to stand trial in January on a second-degree manslaughter charge.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick is also prosecuting guards in  the March 1 fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi  at another Marcy lockup, the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Eight guards have reached plea deals in the case, while five others are scheduled to stand trial in March, including two who are charged with murder.\n \n\n   \n  Both prisons are about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of New York City.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/zohran-mamdani-polling-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:20:00-05:00","title":"What Americans Think of Zohran Mamdani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected New York City Mayor-elect and a self-described democratic socialist, is not widely unpopular among Americans despite strong negative reactions from Republicans and older voters.

And is Mamdani proving to be the boogeyman Republicans hope he’ll be?\n \n\n   \n  We’ve got some new national polling conducted after the self-described democratic socialist’s win earlier this month. And it offers some clues.\n \n\n   \n  In sum: Mamdani isn’t particularly unpopular, especially relative to plenty of other big-name US politicians. But he does clearly animate Republicans and older Americans against him — a lot more than he animates Democrats and young people for him.\n \n\n   \n  And that reinforces the potential utility for the GOP of making him a main character nationally.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  this week showed Americans viewed Mamdani unfavorably by a 38%-29% margin, while a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released last week showed they disliked him 36%-33%.\n \n\n   \n  These are negative numbers, but they’re not exactly “pariah” numbers. In fact, these surveys show Mamdani’s splits are better than some of the most well-known American politicians.\n \n\n   \n  Those include Trump (17-19 points underwater), Vice President JD Vance (14-16 points underwater) and Kamala Harris (minus-19 in the Marquette poll).\n \n\n   \n  Even when it comes to the political middle, the democratic socialist appears to be in relatively decent territory — at least at this early juncture. (He doesn’t take office until January 1.)\n \n\n   \n  While independents disliked him 35%-25% in the Marquette poll, those numbers were actually significantly better than Trump’s (70%-29% unfavorable), Vance’s (60-25%), Harris’s (55%-38%) and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s (54%-32%).\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most strikingly, the Reuters poll actually showed Mamdani’s favorable rating among independents (30%) was actually slightly higher than Trump’s (26%) and similar to Vance’s (28%) — even though Mamdani is far less well-known. (33% of independents viewed him negatively.)\n \n\n   \n  The numbers seem to reinforce something we’ve seen with other prominent democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And that’s that Americans don’t write them off just because of the s-word. (In fact, a July Gallup poll showed Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were actually the  two most popular US politicians among 10 figures  tested.)\n \n\n   \n  Americans seem open to democratic socialists, as long as they are appealing on a personal level and focus on what they think are the right things.\n \n\n   \n  And for Mamdani, that’s  all about affordability . Even the White House has given Mamdani props for that, suggesting it helped him overcome efforts to label him an extremist.\n \n\n   \n  “Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” White House political adviser James Blair  told Politico  the day after the election. “People talk about communists, they can say all these things, but the fact is he was talking about the cost of living.”\n \n\n   \n  And there seems to be something to that. In fact, polls have suggested Americans are actually  in favor of some of Mamdani’s more socialistic ideas , including rent freezing, free public buses and even the much-maligned (on the right) government-owned grocery stores.\n \n\n   \n  You could be forgiven for thinking people just want to see politicians  doing something  about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump’s lack of focus on those issues seems to be costing him dearly, with the Marquette poll showing Americans disapproved of him on the “cost of living” by a massive 72%-28% margin. Even 4 in 10 Republicans disapproved of him on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  All of this being said, it’s clear Mamdani can be politically useful for Republicans. That’s because he negatively polarizes some key groups.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, strong views of Mamdani tilted more negative — by about a 2-to-1 margin in. That suggests the passion was very much on the “anti” side — and that he mobilizes the opposition.\n \n\n   \n  In the Marquette poll, for instance, 56% of Republicans viewed Mamdani “very unfavorably,” compared to just 30% of Democrats who viewed him “very favorably.”\n \n\n   \n  About three-quarters of Republicans who knew Mamdani well enough to rate him felt very negatively toward him. But less than half of Democrats who knew Mamdani that well rated him very positively.\n \n\n   \n  This negative polarization is also particularly strong among older voters. Four times as many Americans aged 60 or older viewed Mamdani very negatively as very positively, according to the Marquette poll. It was about a 3-to-1 margin among Americans aged 45 through 59.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could certainly understand why Republicans want to elevate Mamdani. But using him as a foil doesn’t seem like a silver bullet right now, especially as he seems to have tapped into an issue Trump has struggled with.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/connor-grubb-murder-acquittal-takiya-young","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:43:00.000Z","title":"Officer acquitted in death of Ta’Kiya Young, a pregnant Black mother accused of shoplifting","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Officer Connor Grubb, a Blendon Township police officer, was acquitted of all charges, including murder, in the shooting death of 21-year-old pregnant Black mother Ta’Kiya Young, who was accused of shoplifting from a Kroger store.

Bodycam recordings showed Young refusing to exit her car and then turning her steering wheel to the right, before her car began slowly rolling forward against the body of Grubb, who fired one shot into her chest through the windshield.\n \n\n   \n  Franklin County Common Pleas Judge David Young, no relation to Ta’Kiya, dropped four of 10 counts relating to the death of Young’s unborn daughter, agreeing with defense attorneys that prosecutors failed to present proof that Grubb knew Young was pregnant when he shot her.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors were shown the  bodycam video  on the first day of the two-week trial, and heard testimony from a use-of-force expert, an accident reconstructionist, a police policy expert and Sgt. Erick Moynihan, the officer who with Grubb had ordered Young out of her car.\n \n\n   \n  They never heard from Grubb, whose side of the story was contained in a written statement read into the record by a special agent for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. He attended the trial, but prosecutors were unable to question him directly.\n \n\n   \n  Grubb and Moynihan had approached Young’s parked car on Aug. 24, 2023, about a report that she was suspected of stealing alcohol from a Kroger store in the Columbus suburb. She partially lowered her window and protested as both officers cursed at her and yelled at her to get out. Bodycam video showed Grubb had his left hand on the car’s hood while pointing his gun at her with his right. Young could be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?”\n \n\n   \n  Then, she put on a turn signal and her car rolled slowly forward toward Grubb, who fired a single bullet into her chest, the recording showed.\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Grubb said he had positioned himself in front of Young’s vehicle to provide backup and to protect other people in the parking lot. He said he drew his gun after he heard Young fail to comply with Moynihan’s commands. When her car moved toward him, he said, he felt the vehicle hit his legs and shins and begin to lift his body off the ground as he shot.\n \n\n   \n  Moments later, after the car came to a stop against the building, they broke the driver’s side window. Police said they tried to save her life, but she was mortally wounded. Young and her unborn daughter were pronounced dead at a hospital.\n \n\n   \n  A full-time officer with the township since 2019, Grubb was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Young had two young sons, ages 8 and 5, who are being raised by Ta’Kiya’s grandmother, Nadine Young. Attorney Sean Walton, representing her family, told the AP shortly after the shooting that Young had not stolen anything. He said his law firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “The bottles were left in the store,” Walton said. “So when she’s in her car denying that, that’s accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/uk/former-reform-uk-leader-jailed-for-accepting-pro-russian-bribes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:02:00-05:00","title":"Former Reform UK Leader Nathan Gill Jailed for Bribes to Make Pro-Russia Statements","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, a former leader in Reform UK Wales and a member of the European Parliament, was sentenced to ten and a half years in prison for accepting tens of thousands of pounds in bribes from pro-Russian Ukrainian officials, including Oleg Voloshyn and Viktor Medvedchuk, in exchange for making pro-Russian statements in the European Parliament and to pro-Russian media outlets.

populist  Reform UK party  has been jailed for accepting cash bribes in exchange for making pro-Russian statements in the European Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  Nathan Gill, 52, was sentenced to ten and a half years at London’s Central Criminal Court on Friday after he admitted accepting tens of thousands of pounds in cash over an eight-month period between December 2018 and July 2019.\n \n\n   \n  In return for the payments, which the court heard were referred to by Gill and his handler as “Christmas gifts.” Gill made a series of pro-Russian speeches and statements to the European Parliament, as well as to pro-Russian news outlets in Ukraine, British news agency PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  In sentencing remarks at the Old Bailey, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Gill’s offending was “persistent, rather than an isolated lapse of judgment.”\n \n\n   \n  The court heard that Gill’s illegal activities were first uncovered after he was stopped at Manchester airport as he was about to leave on a trip to Russia on September 13, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  An examination of his phone uncovered a series of messages between Gill and pro-Russian Ukrainian national Oleg Voloshyn, who had been a government official in Kyiv before 2014 and was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  One exchange of messages revealed Voloshyn compensating Gill with 5,000 euros ($5700) for comments made on a pro-Russian news channel 112 Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  On a separate occasion, following European elections in 2019, Voloshyn promised Gill he would be “fairly rewarded” if he brought along some of his colleagues to a presentation at the Strasbourg parliament building given by pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, on the conflict in the Donbas region. Gill replied that he could “drag a few to attend,” PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  Gill served as the Leader of Reform UK Wales from March to May 2021 and led Reform UK’s 2021 Welsh Parliament election campaign. He is no longer a member of the party.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the offenses, Gill was a member of the European Parliament, after being elected for the UK Independence Party (UKIP)\n \n\n   \n  Current Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage has previously said he had no knowledge of Gill’s activities, which he said he condemned “in every possible way.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Security Minister Dan Jarvis said Gill had “used his privileged position in public office to advance the malign interests of Russia over those of the UK in exchange for money.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, he called it “a betrayal of our country, our people, and our national security.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/style/strauss-watch-titanic-auction-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"1111-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:11:00.000Z","title":"Titanic Love Story: The Pocket Watch of Isidor Straus Goes on Sale","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The story of Isidor and Ida Straus, two of the most well-known victims of the Titanic disaster, is being revisited as a gold pocket watch worn by Isidor at the time of the sinking comes up for auction.

But that could change as he completes his first year back in office in January.\n \n\n   \n  At least one of the federal agencies that could see change is the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency helmed by Kristi Noem that is charged with executing Trump’s campaign  promise of mass deportation . Sources also said there could be turnover in the Department of Energy, currently run by  Chris Wright , a former Colorado fracking executive whose relationship with the White House has frayed in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  While there are ongoing discussions, officials stressed that no decisions have been made, and the Cabinet is expected to remain the same at least through the start of next year.\n \n\n   \n  “The cabinet is not changing no matter how much CNN wishes that it would because it thrives off drama,” said White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.\n \n\n   \n    Friction at Homeland Security\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself is happy with Noem, multiple sources told CNN, and he has consistently praised her in public and private settings. But behind the scenes, some top White House officials have become frustrated with chief adviser Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Noem confidante who was tapped early on to serve at DHS as a special government employee — a temporary status.\n \n\n   \n  “The President loves Kristi. He loves the job she’s doing,” one senior White House official told CNN, pushing back on the notion that the former South Dakota governor was on the chopping block.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s history with Noem, dating back to when she was governor, and their dual leadership of the department has prompted questions about whether the two would leave together, therefore opening the head position at DHS.\n \n\n   \n  A familiar face in Trump’s orbit who helped run his 2016 campaign, Lewandowski has become ensconced at DHS and is often at Noem’s side. The enormous power he’s amassed has also put him in the crosshairs of some senior White House officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, he likes [Noem], but it has been brought to his attention that [Lewandowski] is a problem, and the agency is being mismanaged because of it,” a person close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  At DHS, Lewandowski has  directed the firings of personnel , requested employees be put on administrative leave, called agency leaders “to hold them accountable,” and been described as a micro-manager — including for the massive infusion of cash the department has received to ramp up deportations. Multiple sources told CNN Lewandowski has developed a reputation at the department of reprimanding officials who he views as slowing down the administration’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – at President Trump’s direction and under Secretary Noem’s leadership, speak for themselves,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  And a DHS spokesperson said in response to CNN’s questions: “Mr. Lewandowski certainly has reputation of reprimanding officials who impede or slow down the administration and undermine the will of the American people—the American people voted for Donald J. Trump, not a bureaucrat.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump convened a meeting with Lewandowski and Noem over the management of DHS, according to two people familiar with the event. One person said the Oval Office sit-down grew contentious, particularly between Lewandowski and Trump, who left the meeting irritated with Lewandowski. The tense meeting was notable to some inside the White House who believe that Lewandowski has only survived because of his strong relationship with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s relationship with many in Trump’s inner circle, including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, is strained after the 2024 campaign, according to multiple people in and around the White House. Lewandowski was brought on to work for then-campaign co-chairs Wiles and Chris LaCivita just months before Election Day, with the candidate telling his former campaign manager he missed the old days of his first run for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic quickly devolved into a power struggle, with Wiles and LaCivita irked by Lewandowski’s efforts to constantly assert himself in high-level decisions, often taking his opinions directly to Trump, people familiar with the discussions told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski  was sidelined  before the campaign ended, and he didn’t score a top position in the West Wing. Instead, he ended up at Homeland Security with a  temporary job status  that is supposed to last for only 130 workdays in a yearlong period. Though Lewandowski began working for DHS soon after Trump returned to office, the spokesperson said he still had 40 days remaining.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the current relationship, a White House official noted that Wiles had a meeting with Noem and Lewandowski regarding FEMA this week.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, DHS often caught the ire of the president over not doing enough to clamp down on immigration. Over the course of that term, the department had five secretaries, three of whom served in acting capacities.\n \n\n   \n    Other Cabinet questions\n \n\n   \n  Wright has also found himself on the outs with the White House recently, people familiar with the dynamics told CNN, prompting speculation his job atop the Energy Department might be in a precarious position. The people familiar said that some White House officials have privately complained that Wright was slow-walking some initiatives that Trump promised during his campaign and that he has contributed to high turnover in some of the agency’s top jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Wright has been working lockstep with President Trump since day one to restore America’s energy dominance and safeguard our economic and national security,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “Thanks to the Trump Administration’s historic efforts to ‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’, oil production hit an all-time record high in July while prices at the pump have fallen to the lowest in years.”\n \n\n   \n  Energy Department spokesman Ben Dietderich also pushed back on the idea that Wright’s standing was shaky. “Just last week, President Trump  called  Secretary Wright ‘the number one energy person anywhere in the world.’ No serious person is buying this anonymously sourced fake news,” Dietderich told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time that a Cabinet secretary has appeared to be on thin ice in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the possible replacement of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was  discussed at length  after the revelation that he had accidentally shared sensitive information on a Signal chain to which a reporter had been added. Over the summer, Trump  grew annoyed  with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, over her stance on Iran’s nuclear capability.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hegseth and Gabbard have remained in their jobs, but pressure to replace Hegseth could resurface in the coming weeks as the Pentagon’s internal watchdog is expected to release its report on the Signal incident, which — while not carrying any formal sanction for the Defense Secretary — could return the issue to the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n    Youngkin in the wings?\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited out of office in January, is among the Republican leaders expected to be under consideration for any potential openings in the Cabinet or administration. While the president has praised Youngkin, several Republicans close to Trump say, the two men have not had a direct conversation about any prospective role.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin, who turns 59 next month, saw his endorsed successor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears,  defeated in a landslide  on Nov. 4 in an embarrassing loss for the governor and his fellow Republicans in the state.\n \n\n   \n  In a call with supporters before that election, Youngkin showered Trump with praise.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I want to thank you,” Youngkin said. “You’ve cut trade deals, peace deals, you’ve brought huge investments back to the United States. I know that you will always put America first.”\n \n\n   \n  The president responded in kind, calling Youngkin “one of the great governors in our country.” Trump added, “We’re very proud of you and the job you’ve done.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor has told allies that he would be excited by the prospect of joining the Cabinet, should a vacancy arise, but he has expressed more interest in an economic or business portfolio, rather than one focused on immigration. One longtime friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Youngkin would likely be reluctant to assume the reins of Trump’s aggressive deportation policies at the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been made clear that [Youngkin] is interested in working for the administration in some capacity,” one senior White House official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Youngkin did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s plans when he leaves office in January.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin is weighing his political future, allies say, even though he is uncertain whether he could find a suitable opening to match his ambitions. He made summer trips to Iowa and South Carolina, two key stops in any Republican presidential primary, to meet party activists and keep his options open.\n \n\n   \n  Some Cabinet turnover is expected in any administration. During former President Joe Biden’s administration, the departments of Housing and Urban Development as well as Labor saw changes at the top, but neither vacancy occurred in the first two years.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/mamdani-trump-white-house-meeting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:13:00.000Z","title":"Trump set to host Mamdani at the White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political development, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on November 21, 2025, for their first face-to-face encounter.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:13 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As he celebrated a decisive victory earlier this month, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made a direct appeal to President Donald Trump: “Since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!”\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders will hear each other loud and clear when they come face-to-face at the White House on Friday for their first meeting, which the mayor-elect has said he requested.\n \n\n   \n  And while it will offer an opportunity to try to forge a working relationship between the federal government and the new leader of the country’s most populous city, political tensions loom large.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone ahead of time, praising Mamdani’s win and predicting a “civil” meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “We meet at 3 o’clock today, and I think it’s going to be quite civil. We’ll find out,” Trump said in a radio interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s got a different philosophy. He’s a little bit different. I give him a lot of credit for the run. He did a successful run, and we all know that runs are not easy, but I think we’ll get along fine,” Trump added of the mayor-elect.\n \n\n   \n  Just a day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated the president’s frequent line of attack during the mayoral campaign when asked about the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,” Leavitt told reporters Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee. (Mamdani  has said  he is not a communist despite the White House’s claims.) Trump had also threatened to halt the city’s federal funding if Mamdani won, and indicated openness to  seizing control  of the city – which could put the mayor-elect’s agenda at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s not about myself, it’s not about a relationship with an individual. It’s about a relationship between New York City and the White House,” Mamdani told reporters on Thursday previewing the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor-elect spent much of Thursday preparing for the meeting, including by holding calls with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss how to approach it and how best to communicate with Trump, according to an aide to Mamdani’s transition team. He also spoke with Robert Wolf, the former CEO of UBS Americas and a known ally of former President Barack Obama, according to Wolf’s  post on social media .\n \n\n   \n  The face-to-face between the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist comes after Mamdani secured a commanding victory — winning more than 50% of the vote — with a focus on working-class issues. His strong performance — coupled with Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia — has, in part, fueled Trump’s attacks on “affordability” as a Democratic “con job.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Thursday suggested affordability is at the top of his agenda for Friday’s discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I’ll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we’ve been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has  promised action  to make public buses free and reduce the cost of living, including by opening government-run grocery stores, freezing the rent for 1 million rent-stabilized tenants in the city, and a plan to create New York City’s first universal childcare program.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN exit polling, 27% of voters in the mayoral election approved of Trump, compared to 70% who disapproved. And while a majority of voters in the overwhelmingly blue city — 58% — said that Trump was not a factor in their vote, 32% said they cast their ballots to express opposition to the president.\n \n\n   \n  There is, however, crossover in the Venn-Diagram of voters who supported both Trump in 2024 and Mamdani this year: 10% of Trump’s voters voted for Mamdani, according to CNN exit polling.\n \n\n   \n  The city, Leavitt said Thursday, is “becoming much more left than I think this president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  But she cast the meeting as a reflection of Trump’s willingness to “meet with anyone and talk to anyone.” Asked whether the president could be persuaded to abandon his threat to cut federal funding to New York, she declined to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated that threat the day after the election, while offering a glimmer of collegiality. “I thought it was a very angry speech, certainly angry toward me. And I think he should be very nice to me. You know, I’m the one that sort of has to approve a lot of things coming to him, so he’s off to a bad start,” he told Fox News’ Bret Baier.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York. I really love New York,” the president added.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani also offers Trump — and his party — a political foil ahead of the 2026 midterms. The soon-to-be lame duck president, who has focused on rivals like former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, could make the mayor-to-be, who takes office January 1, his new boogeyman.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance, who may have his own higher political ambitions, has no interest in Friday’s get-together.\n \n\n   \n  “I might have a stomach bug,” he joked at a Thursday Breitbart News event.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s meeting with the president is taking place earlier than usual as he has not yet taken office. New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with Trump in the Oval Office in May 2025 and former Mayor Bill de Blasio met with him inside Trump Tower shortly after Trump was elected the first time in 2016. The meeting between Mamdani and Trump is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Trump indicated that the meeting, which is currently closed to press, will likely open to reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine with me, I would think so. He’s a politician, so I don’t think he has a problem,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/americas/canada-grizzly-school-attack-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:09:00-05:00","title":"Grizzly Bear Attacks Schoolchildren and Teachers in Canada, Injuring 11","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grizzly bear attacked a group of schoolchildren and teachers on a walking trail in Bella Coola, British Columbia, Canada, resulting in 11 injuries, two of which were life-threatening.

\n       \n  By Michael Williams, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:53 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Coast Guard on Thursday issued a memo that reclassifies swastikas and nooses as “hate symbols,” in a rapid about-face after facing intense scrutiny for a previous policy change which downplayed their display as merely “potentially divisive.”\n \n\n   \n  The  newest memo  expressly prohibits the display of nooses, swastikas or “any symbols or flags co-opted or adopted by hate-based groups as representations of supremacy, racial or religious intolerance, anti-semitism, or any other improper bias.”\n \n\n   \n  It was released hours after  The Washington Post reported  that the Coast Guard had approved a policy that downgraded the way the symbols, which are some of the most recognizable emblems of racism and antisemitism, had previously been classified.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, Coast Guard policy had said displaying the symbols “constitutes a potential hate incident.” In the  updated policy  first  reported by The Post  on Thursday, and issued by the Coast Guard last week, that language had been changed to referring to those symbols simply as “potentially divisive.” That policy had been set to take effect in December.\n \n\n   \n  The  newest policy , released yesterday, says: “Divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited.” It lists swastikas, nooses and other emblems that have been adopted or co-opted by hate groups.\n \n\n   \n  The reversal came amid heavy criticism that the Coast Guard, a military branch which falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, was downplaying the display of insignia which imply support for some of the darkest moments in human history.\n \n\n   \n  DHS denied it had changed its policy before the Coast Guard issued the apparent reversal. An agency spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, also denied in a post to social media on Friday that the Coast Guard was “backtracking” by issuing the latest memo.\n \n\n   \n  “The 2025 policy is not changing—USCG issued a lawful order that doubles down on our *current* policies prohibiting the display, distribution or use of hate symbols by Coast Guard personnel,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nooses symbolize the legacy of  racial hatred and terror  in the United States that saw thousands of Black people lynched between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. Swastikas epitomize Adolf Hitler’s murderous regime in Nazi Germany, which killed millions of people during the Holocaust and sparked a war in which more than 400,000 American service members — including about 1,900 who served in the Coast Guard — also died.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Lauren Underwood, an Illinois Democrat, said she met with the Coast Guard’s acting commandant, Admiral Kevin Lunday, to express concerns about the update to the policy. She said she received a commitment from him that the policy would change and become more restrictive.\n \n\n   \n  “He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,” Underwood said in a  video statement .\n \n\n   \n  Lunday also insisted in a statement Thursday that swastikas and other “extremist imagery” remain prohibited in the Coast Guard.\n \n\n   \n  “Any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished,” he said. “Symbols such as swastikas, nooses and other extremist or racist imagery violate our core values and are treated with the seriousness they warrant under current policy.”\n \n\n   \n  The military at times  has struggled  with combatting extremism among their service members. A  2020 Pentagon report  found that extremist views were not widespread in the military, but said the issue was still urgent due to the ability of people with military experience to carry out “high-impact events.”\n \n\n   \n  During President Joe Biden’s term, Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin  in 2021 ordered a staggered pause in operations across the military so commanders could have discussions with their service members about the issue of extremism.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed the idea of there being an issue with extremism in the military. During  his confirmation hearing  in January, Hegseth said a focus on extremism has “created a climate inside our ranks that feel political when it hasn’t ever been political.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-analysis-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump is giving Russia almost everything it wants with his Ukraine peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A widely leaked draft of President Donald Trump’s 28-point Ukraine peace plan is being criticized as a dangerous and maximalist proposal that favors Russia.

November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trying the same thing over and over again, without success, is either the definition of insanity or  Russian  negotiation tactics, depending on your point of view.\n \n\n   \n  The widely leaked draft of  President Donald Trump’s 28-point plan  is a terrifying leap backwards for Kyiv. It was co-conceived by Russians who wanted to pretend they were engaging in peace, and circulated by Ukrainians and Europeans who felt it was so ridiculous it would surely die on first contact with oxygen.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the text resembles the maximalist  positions Russia held during talks in Istanbul in 2022 when its forces held more of Ukraine, and the slow, grinding    military embarrassment of the past three years was still ahead of them. Before we dissect the text - and its profound, dizzying advantages for the Kremlin - the timing of this renewed, mostly Moscow-initiated plan, is key.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s forces are perhaps in their best position for about a year.   They are weeks, even days, away from taking the embattled eastern military hub of Pokrovsk, a place of outsized significance and great strategic import, grimly fought over since last summer. Their forces are at  its southern edges, and if they take it would  encounter few sizeable population centers to their west that are under Ukrainian control before they near the capital, Kyiv. That land is mostly flat and open, ideal for a swift advance. Moscow has also had a breakout across Zaporizhzhia region, using armor and moving its forces perilously close to Zaporizhzhia city, taking, again, open and flat territory that will remain vulnerable during winter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine continues to see high desertion rates and draft-avoidance, adding to its serious manpower issues and Kyiv’s drone advantage has been eroded by swift Russian learning and innovation. President Volodymyr Zelensky is also suffering a popularity nadir – facing the repercussions of an ongoing and intimately detailed corruption scandal that touches both his inner circle and the very thing Ukrainians must endure daily – energy outages.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian initiative is obviously set to exploit Ukraine’s moment of perhaps unprecedented vulnerability   – when a domestic political crisis threatens to hobble Zelensky in confronting frontline emergencies. The appalling timing for Kyiv may also explain why Moscow has bothered to – yet again – present a series of maximalist demands that Ukraine and its allies have also flatly and repeatedly dismissed. One European diplomat   described it as Groundhog Day. But in the movie, the rub of that day on repeat was not that it became predictable and tedious, but that you were forced to constantly relive it.\n \n\n   \n  The 28 leaked points serve two purposes for Moscow. They present a starting block that is so advantageous that even achieving parts of it would be a huge win. And they also provide an edifice to which Russian diplomats can constantly return if they wish to, yet again, slow-roll diplomacy while their military has the advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Demands that Ukraine constitutionally reject NATO membership, de-Nazify, guarantee its neutrality and limit the size of its armed forces were in the Istanbul 2022 document. Then, at the height of the Russian invasion’s initial ambition they were an amorphous set of maximalist terms that amounted to a form of Ukrainian surrender.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has survived formidably since that gambit but has been weakened by the fight.\n \n\n   \n  The use of $100 billion in frozen Russian funds to rebuild Ukraine appears, on the surface, to be a Russian concession. Yet the most brutalized parts of Ukraine are under Russian occupation, and this money would go to Russia to execute the rebuild under its terms. The deal proposes that half of any reconstruction profits would somehow go to the United States, and some of the money would be invested in other joint US-Russian projects. The scope for Moscow getting much of this cash back is vast, and the deal also proposes that international sanctions be lifted entirely, which would be a huge financial boon of its own.\n \n\n   \n  There are three other hidden shards of glass in this repeat serving of Russian diplomatic porridge. First is the demand for elections 100 days after a deal’s signature.\n \n\n   \n  This is, by most accounts, technically impossible given the challenges of demobilization, war-time logistics and legal reform. A rushed, poorly executed poll would be the outcome, yielding a government of questionable legitimacy and providing a space for misinformation and manipulation large enough for the Russians to drive another tank through, with their preferred candidate sat on top. Zelensky cannot accept this deadline, and a snap election was a Russian canard from earlier this year that the Trump administration seemed to drop. Its revival – and with it, discussion of Zelensky’s shelf life – re-emerges at a time of new weakness for this wartime leader.\n \n\n   \n  Second is the confusing concept of turning the parts of the eastern Donbas region currently under Ukrainian control into a demilitarized zone that is technically part of Russia. This amounts to surrendering them to Russian “civilian” forces. This is terrain Moscow would otherwise have to bitterly fight for over the next year. Even a compromise of declaring this area a demilitarized zone, from which the militaries of both sides are barred, feeds into Russia’s rich history of using “people’s militias” to infiltrate territory and declare a popular revolt in Moscow’s favor.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky cannot cede the city of Kramatorsk. It would yield Russian President Vladimir Putin a military bulwark from which to launch another, easier attack toward Kyiv across open ground, perhaps within months. It would open Zelensky up to internal political challenges. Moscow knows this, but keeps going back to it in the hope that eventually Trump is ground down into seeing this concession as a necessary part of any solution.\n \n\n   \n  Thirdly, the wording of the circulated deal is vague, and seems at times to be rush-translated from Russian or Ukrainian, containing several “snapback” clauses. One says Ukraine’s security guarantees will be “deemed invalid” if they fire a missile at “Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause” – a caveat of great consequence and breadth of interpretation. Russia will have a different view of what “cause” is great enough to that held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also demands all “Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected or prohibited” in Ukraine, a repeat of the Russian false talking –point that it is facing a Kyiv government run by Nazi extremists. Would the appearance of a far-right flag on a Ukrainian unit, or an SS Death’s Head emblem in an unofficial military Telegram page, suddenly void the deal? In its current form, the deal is something Moscow can walk out on at any time, with slim justification.\n \n\n   \n  If there is any Russian error in this document, it is not in its timing, or blunt obstinacy, but in its clear exposition that Moscow retains most of its maximalist demands as its starting point. That has in the past angered Trump, and indeed resulted in the most severe sanctions imposed yet by the US on Russia, against oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  But the Kremlin has correctly seen its steep advances on the battlefield, Ukraine’s domestic turbulence and serious frontline fragility, Europe’s concerns about how long it can fund Kyiv’s defense, and Trump’s overwhelming hunger for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2026, and tried to make the old sound new again.\n \n\n   \n  If it buys time, it works. If a third of it sticks, or becomes the lexicon of any future deal, it works. In the past year, almost everything else has been tried once. So, for Moscow, trying the same old, bad idea again makes total sense.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-ukraine-peace-gaza-witkoff","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Rushes to Emulate Gaza Plan in New Push for Ukraine Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is advancing a new framework to end the war in Ukraine, modeled closely on the Gaza ceasefire deal it helped broker.

to emulate Gaza plan in new push for Ukraine Deal \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:47 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Believing they have  a new window of opportunity  to restart peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump administration officials are rushing ahead with a new framework to end the Ukraine war modeled after the Gaza deal President Donald Trump pushed, despite little initial input from Ukrainian or European allies, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  The push to restart talks reemerged as a top priority for the president in recent weeks — shortly after the US helped broker a ceasefire in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has indicated he wants to expedite the timeline for ending the war in Ukraine, hoping to conclude a conflict he once said publicly would be the easily resolved, the sources added. Some US officials have said that the administration wants Russia and Ukraine to agree to a deal by the end of the year, according to two sources.\n \n\n   \n  Like the proposal the Trump administration crafted which led to the  ceasefire in Gaza , the Ukraine plan reads as a listicle of bullet points, laying out commitments each side would make in order to drive a lasting end to the conflict. Both proposals call for the halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing war, now approaching its fourth year, has fueled the frustrations of a US president who regularly touts his dealmaking ability and believes he has not received enough credit for overseeing other recent diplomatic successes, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, several top Trump administration officials have turned their focus back to the  war in Ukraine  and the US has considered enlisting some of the same foreign intermediaries who helped facilitate negotiations related to Gaza – including Qatar and Turkey – to play a more prominent, but still behind the scenes, diplomatic role, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the similarities to the Gaza ceasefire deal that appeared in the Ukraine framework for peace that emerged on Thursday, which US officials cautioned was not a final proposal, were very stark. Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, which is being overseen by a Trump-led “Board of Peace,” the draft proposal describes the Ukraine peace implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump,” according to a draft seen by CNN. The draft’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  The draft also included components that Russian diplomats have pushed and Ukrainian officials have previously rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the 28-point plan includes elements such as territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia, a limit on the size of Ukraine’s armed forces and a Ukrainian commitment in its constitution that it will not join NATO, the draft said. Reports emerged earlier this week that President Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff was working with Russia on the framework, which includes the Russian maximalist demands.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff has been working with Russian Special Envoy and the head of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund Kirill Dmitriev directly for many months and the two have remained engaged in crafting this new draft proposal, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As Europeans monitored reports that emerged on Tuesday that Witkoff had worked exclusively with Russian officials to develop the plan, some were on edge, according to six sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Europeans who said they had not been briefed on the details grew concerned about what the effort could mean for Ukraine – given their longstanding position that Ukraine must be involved in any discussions about a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday night, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted that ending the war would require “an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas.” Rubio added that the Trump administration would continue “to develop a list of potential ideas” to end the Ukraine war, without saying any final proposal was being floated.\n \n\n   \n  Some Europeans let out a collective sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday nerves were up, today nerves are down,” said a diplomat based in Brussels on Thursday, explaining that Rubio’s tweet had appeared to chill the idea that a firm new deal was on the table that the US would be urging Ukraine to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “The president lets hundreds of flowers bloom,” the diplomat added, pointing to the possibility that the efforts could have been driven by Witkoff freelancing, but also noting that he is one of few people who has the official green-light do that from the president.\n \n\n   \n  A senior State Department official said that Rubio “was reiterating a point he has made for months – a diplomatic end to the war requires both sides to make concessions, and that cannot happen without ongoing dialogue.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that both Witkoff and Rubio “have been working on a plan quietly for about the last month.” She would not go into details of the plan, saying that it’s “ongoing” and “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt acknowledged that the administration was taking cues from its playbook on the Gaza ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff and Rubio, she said, have “been engaging with both sides, Russia and Ukraine equally, to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you get to a peace negotiation, right? That’s how it worked with Israel, with respect to Israel and Gaza and all of the Arab countries in the Middle East,” she said at a press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The new push comes just after  recent reports of corruption  inside Ukraine, which some administration officials believe leaves the Ukrainian government in a weakened state, and some Europeans are concerned about the US seeking to leverage that weakness.\n \n\n   \n  Still, other Europeans diplomats believe that a continued push towards a peace agreement is useful. One European diplomat explained that they viewed Witkoff’s current efforts as a natural evolution of continued US strategy to drive a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to look at it as an evolution of a negotiation. You take out points, dial up points… the two sides won’t get an agreement overnight,” the European said.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not publicly endorsed the ongoing efforts. The Kremlin denied it is working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine this week, saying Thursday there were “no new developments” following a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Russia and the US are currently working towards an end to the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “there are no consultations as such currently underway. There are certainly contacts. But there is no process that could be called consultations. It is not ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  As of last week, Rubio still publicly said his assessment was Russia did not want peace.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve stated clearly what they want is they want the rest of Donetsk, and obviously the Ukrainians aren’t going to agree to that,” he told reporters after a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the assessment we have to make,” he said. “They’ve made a demand that Ukraine can’t agree to, and so that’s sort of where we are at this point.”\n \n\n   \n  When the top US diplomat spoke with his Russian counterpart by phone last month, officials felt that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, a source familiar with the matter said at the time. Potential meetings between Rubio and Lavrov and Trump and Putin did not move forward, despite Trump saying just a week prior that he planned to meet the Russian president.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials said that the reported plan is not the final product, and the fact that it has a number of items that had been pushed by Russia and previously rejected by Ukraine does not mean that is the expectation for an agreement at the end of the ongoing talks – including talks with Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The plan was presented on Thursday to the Ukrainians by the Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, two sources said. While his trip to Ukraine was previously scheduled, it was an opportunity to share the current thinking on the revived push to end the war, the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian presidential office did not outright reject the current US efforts, saying Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, who becomes the primary Trump administration point person for the Ukrainians as the administration pushes – again – for a peace deal remains unclear. Throughout the last year, Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, has served as the chief Trump administration official communicating with the Ukrainians. But in recent months he has privately told people that he plans to depart early next year, which could leave a significant void until that role is filled.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/charlotte-life-border-patrol-trump","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00+00:00","title":"New Market Regulation Sparks Positive Economic Shifts in Regional Economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new market regulation, Regulation 2023-10, was introduced on October 4, 2023, to enhance market transparency and fairness.

In contrast to their Windy City presence, Bovino and at least some of his team  left Charlotte  on Thursday, a Homeland Security official said, as elevated immigration enforcement continues.\n \n\n   \n  The strong shows of force against migrants in Democratic-led cities have become a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s intense immigration enforcement agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In the Charlotte area, more than 250 people were  arrested  over four days of immigration raids, the Department of Homeland Security  said  Wednesday. “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the agency  said .\n \n\n   \n  “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin  said  in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, a protest outside Manolo’s against the federal effort builds throughout the day, growing to dozens of people and stretching the strip mall’s small parking lot to its limits.\n \n\n   \n    As popular bakery closes, community rises in support\n \n\n   \n  The demonstration began with just one man.\n \n\n   \n  Jerry Ortiz stands  alongside Central Avenue , waving a massive Puerto Rican flag featuring a tree frog called the coquí – with a songlike call that sounds like its name – as passing drivers honk their support. The frog, a native of Puerto Rico like Ortiz himself, is an important symbol of the island’s culture.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the car horns are music to his ears.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s beautiful,” Ortiz says.\n \n\n   \n  But not every note of Central Avenue’s cacophony supports his message.\n \n\n   \n  “Get them illegal sons of bitches out of here!” yells the passenger in one truck as it passes Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not an entirely surprising message in a county where  a third  of the votes cast in the last presidential election were for Donald Trump. Ortiz shrugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Something is wrong that they don’t appreciate us here,” he says. “We come here to work hard, to make this country better.”\n \n\n   \n  While Ortiz keeps watch along the street,  bakery owner  Manolo Betancur stops by several times a day to make sure federal agents haven’t returned and to talk to the growing crowd that cheers loudly as he raises a large American flag alongside the coquí.\n \n\n   \n  “My biggest concern right now is our children need to have their fathers and mothers next to them,” Betancur says.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of these people are so scared, they’re not going to have Thanksgiving (dinner),” adds Ortiz, standing a few feet from the locked entrance to Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  Even as the fear forced Betancur to close his business, supporters are still paying for cakes from Manolo’s through the bakery’s website. He contacts them to make sure they understand he can’t fulfill the order right now.\n \n\n   \n  “They say, ‘No, it’s a donation,’” says Betancur.\n \n\n   \n  More protesters show up outside Manolo’s as midday approaches. Brandi Yanes is supporting people who now feel the pain she felt in 2018, when her husband was  detained by ICE  after a sheriff’s office identified him as undocumented following an altercation at a bar, she says.\n \n\n   \n  “Once he came home, my daughter was 6 months old. He had four months with us, and then he had to self-deport to Honduras,” Yanes says.\n \n\n   \n  Though they talk on the phone almost daily, Yanes’ daughter – now almost 8 years old – hasn’t seen her father in person in two years.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, with (immigration agents) being back here, and she’s seeing what’s going on, she’s waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying,” says Yanes. “She’s asking, ‘Are my friends going to be OK?’”\n \n\n   \n  Betancur looks on at the crowd, growing to dozens by midafternoon, with appreciation.\n \n\n   \n  “If it weren’t for the immigrant community, I wouldn’t have a business,” says Betancur. “They are my customers. They are my employees.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic losses he is facing, Betancur has the one thing that is priceless for any immigrant: citizenship. He now carries his US passport with him everywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n    Immigrants made the community what it is, neighbors say\n \n\n   \n  Dianna Ward gave up a high-paying corporate career to start her own tour business, and she knows how to weave in history lessons at Charlotte’s hot spots. But when showing off the Plaza Midwood neighborhood where she lives, she chooses an unlikely starting point:  Evergreen Cemetery .\n \n\n   \n  “Look over here,” she says, pointing to a row of headstones from the 1940s. “It’s all Greek.” Other graves show the names of Italian and Jewish residents who helped build the community.\n \n\n   \n  “This has always been an immigrant community,” says Ward. “Immigrants claimed it and have done a beautiful job of making this a place you want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Ward points to million-dollar historic homes, Vietnamese restaurants, an Irish pub and bohemian art as signs of her  neighborhood’s diversity .\n \n\n   \n  “But this is my favorite place,” she says while passing the Central Avenue location of Tacos El Nevado. It is noon, and the restaurant is completely dark, chairs stacked up on the tables.\n \n\n   \n  “It is usually so packed in this restaurant, but look at it now.”\n \n\n   \n    Some stores stay open, even with fewer workers and customers\n \n\n   \n  With the earlier  threat of federal agents  turning out to be false alarm, things pick up a bit by midday at the Sav/Way, where the bustling lunch counter is serving up massive tortas piled impossibly high with meat and jalapeños.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike an average day before Operation Charlotte’s Web, there is no 30-minute wait to be served.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we lose money, we need to keep it open if we can,” says Sav/Way owner Rudy Montero, whose weathered face and gray moustache are the only visible signs of his 72 years. After decades of seven-day weeks running the store, Montero still comes every day to take deliveries and energetically supervise.\n \n\n   \n  “You need to be positive all the time,” says Montero. “I feel terrible about this, but we need to keep going.”\n \n\n   \n  Montero’s positivity is matched by one of his most enthusiastic lunch counter customers, Jesse Pacheco-Anguiano. Wearing a beaded crucifix over the number “7” on his shirt in honor of Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, he gives new visitors the lowdown on his favorites.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cubana is a big, big torta,” he emphasizes. “Do you have a big appetite?”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano is a home renovation contractor who  depends on day laborers , including a worker he saw being picked up by Border Patrol agents in their now-familiar green uniforms and facemasks at a Lowe’s on Saturday, the first day of the Charlotte operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I was born and raised here in Charlotte my whole life, and this is the first time in my life I’ve seen this happen,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano says the agents left him alone after checking his driver’s license, but agents drove away with his worker in two unmarked crossovers, leaving a half-loaded stack of lumber still sticking out of the back of the customized work van with the name of his business covering both sides.\n \n\n   \n  “Look at this. They’re embarrassing me,” he says in Spanish in a cell phone video of the encounter he took and shared with CNN. DHS has not responded to CNN’s questions about this incident.\n \n\n   \n    The crackdown becomes a costly burden on small businesses\n \n\n   \n  With his business effectively shut down, Pacheco-Anguiano joins the protesters when he can. Starting his own business was a long-time dream, and he wants to use what he has to help those who can’t speak up.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just trying to protest for my people who don’t have a voice, and I’m here for them,” Pacheco-Anguiano says.\n \n\n   \n  The full economic impact of the immigration enforcement operation is not clear, but CharlotteEAST, a nonprofit community organization, says small businesses  are struggling .\n \n\n   \n  “For a little tienda, (it’s costing) $400 a day. A hair salon, $500. A restaurant, $5,000 a day,” says the executive director, Greg Asciutto.\n \n\n   \n  His group looks out for about 400 mom-and-pop businesses in East Charlotte, about half of them owned by immigrants, Asciutto says.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, our whole commercial thoroughfare is shut down, right?” he says. “And these are American citizens. These are American-owned businesses.”\n \n\n   \n  The economic strain is showing not just on business owners but also on workers. Even as the immigration raids go on, Pacheco-Anguiano continues to get calls from workers asking for a gig, telling him they have no choice as their money begins to dry up, he says.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re willing to take the risk, but I’m like, ‘Dude, I can’t have that on my conscience if anything happens on the way from here to your house,’” says Pacheco-Anguiano.\n \n\n   \n    Community members show support with their dollars\n \n\n   \n  With Manolo’s Bakery closed, Pacheco-Anguiano moves down Central Avenue to Panadería Odalys, where traditional Latino pastries sit alongside doughnuts and slices of vanilla-iced cake with sprinkles, loading up a pan of treats for family and friends.\n \n\n   \n  About half of the display cases are  uncharacteristically empty , a sign of the difficulty owner Cervantes Almanza is having in finding enough staff who feel safe going to work. But he points to the 5-foot-high racks of baked goods just rolled out into the center of the store.\n \n\n   \n  “Have some. They’re fresh!” says Almanza in Spanish, an announcement made redundant by the aroma that quickly fills the room.\n \n\n   \n  A new customer is unprepared for the store’s cash-only policy, but Almanza gives a silent wave and head shake to show this one is on the house, his gratitude for the community’s support. (A veteran Odalys customer quietly slips money over the counter to pay the bill while Almanza isn’t looking.)\n \n\n   \n  Since Lolo Pendergrast found out Odalys was open but struggling with a reduced staff, she buys as many pastries as she can stuff into an oversized delivery box.\n \n\n   \n  “I got a whole bunch now, and I’m just going around town and handing them out to protesters,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  Pendergrast is retired from teaching English as a Second Language at Merry Oaks International Academy, a public elementary school.\n \n\n   \n  “The people that live right next to it, they’re our friends, our neighbors, you know, and they’re not illegal,” said Pendergrast. “I do not understand how we’ve gotten so off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n    Keeping an eye out for the ‘ Migra’ \n \n\n   \n  Almanza stays vigilant, looking out his bakery’s front door. His workers pick up on a sudden change in mood that takes the air out of the room. The owner doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.\n \n\n   \n  As Almanza quietly slides the door open for a closer look,  a panicked voice  shouts from behind the building.\n \n\n   \n  “ Migra !  Migra !” a woman yells, feverishly ringing a cowbell.\n \n\n   \n  She runs fast through a residential street into the back of the Odalys parking lot, tailing a pair of unmarked vehicles that quickly blast a siren at oncoming traffic before making sharp right turns onto Central Avenue. Another vehicle follows, with a protester lying on the horn.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to make sure everybody’s good,” the woman says, now leaning over with a hand on one knee to catch her breath before returning to work.\n \n\n   \n  The Odalys employees  feel some relief  as they go back to their jobs, but a reminder of the toll this is taking on the neighborhood remains just outside their windows. Next door, the popular Salvadoran restaurant Morazán remains closed, the parking lot empty.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m born and raised in East Charlotte,” says neighbor Jorge Neri-Moreno, standing next to the shuttered restaurant, “and seeing all this breaks my heart.”\n \n\n   \n    Some children skip class, and volunteers try to keep schools safe\n \n\n   \n  Outside Shamrock Gardens Elementary School, parents Patricia Hoke and Laura Blum sit in lawn chairs at the entrance on Anne Street, a large handwritten poster next to them saying, “NO ICE.” They’re part of a network of volunteers waiting outside  local schools  during drop-off and pickup hours with whistles around their necks, watching for federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea is if we see them, we alert,” Blum says. “And I think it’s just a presence for people to know their community’s behind them.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been no immigration raids outside Charlotte schools so far, but the mothers’ work mixes a strong sense of purpose with a lingering sense of paranoia.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone feels on edge, even though it’s quiet,” says Hoke.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said.\n \n\n   \n  To make sure as many East Charlotte schools as possible are covered, many parent volunteers are now communicating using encrypted messaging apps, just in case they’re being monitored themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned to use Signal yesterday,” says Blum with a slight smile.\n \n\n   \n    Some businesses stay open – but locked up\n \n\n   \n  Before getting back to the protests – his new job for the time being – Pacheco-Anguiano has one more stop to make, pulling his work van into the parking lot at La Reina de las Carnitas, where the smell of fried pork and freshly made tortillas usually draws an overflow crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Owner Ricardo Albarrán immediately gives Pacheco-Anguiano a smile and a fatherly arm around the shoulder. The visitor didn’t just come here for food. Just a few years earlier, Pacheco-Anguiano worked here before striking out on his own with the renovation business. Now, he wants to  check up on  his old boss.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán says he closed at 2 p.m. on the day Operation Charlotte’s Web started and stayed closed through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On the first day he tried to reopen the shop, only two employees showed up for work. The rest were too afraid. Now, Albarrán keeps the front deadbolt latched until a worker at the door is comfortable that whoever is approaching is a customer.\n \n\n   \n  “Every business is doing the same thing to protect the people,” he says in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán sees would-be customers doing their own surveillance, trying to figure out whether an officer in the parking lot, or even just an SUV with tinted windows, might be from Border Patrol, making the short trip from a car to his door too risky.\n \n\n   \n  “ ¿Sí o no? ¿Sí o no? ” they seem to be asking themselves as they assess the level of danger, he says.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán has  enormous pride  in his business, he says as he begins speaking in English for emphasis.\n \n\n   \n  “I came from Mexico, and this is my dream,” he says. “All countries have good people. I don’t know why (this is happening).”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano gets another pat on the shoulder and heads out, happy to see his old workplace has been able to stay in operation. But as he exits the carnicería, the sound of the door lock clicking behind him is a stark reminder of the reality his community is still facing.\n \n\n   \n  “You know how they say they come for criminals?” he asks. “I think that’s not right. Because we’re here just trying to get a job done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dianne Gallagher and Lacey Russell contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/style/miss-universe-2025-finale-winner-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00.000Z","title":"Mexico’s Fatima Bosch crowned Miss Universe winner in glittering finale of scandal-hit pageant","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fatima Bosch of Mexico won Miss Universe 2025 in a highly controversial finale marked by internal drama and public backlash.

\nUpdated: \n        11:36 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fatima Bosch of Mexico has been named Miss Universe 2025 in a scandal-hit competition where she emerged as a fan favorite after she was  berated  by a Thai pageant director during a pre-pageant meeting, triggering a walk out by contestants.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old humanitarian and volunteer was crowned by last year’s winner  Victoria Kjær Theilvig  from Denmark.\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe is widely known as the “Super Bowl” of beauty pageants and draws millions of viewers each year. Delegates for each country are selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Praveenar Singh came runner up, with Venezuela’s Stephany Abasali,  Philippines’ Ahtisa Manalo  and Ivory Coast’s Olivia Yacé also making it to the top 5.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand, this year’s host country, has a vibrant and lucrative pageant industry with one of the largest fanbases in Asia,  alongside the Philippines. \n \n\n   \n  The event featured representatives from 120 countries. Nadeen Ayoub became the first woman to represent  Palestinian people  at the pageant, and made it to the final 30 semifinalists before she was eliminated. Friday’s finale was hosted by American comedian Steve Byrne and opened with a performance by Thai singer Jeff Satur.\n \n\n   \n  Following the swimwear round, the top 30 contestants were narrowed down to 12, and then down to 5 after the evening round.\n \n\n   \n  Finalists were asked questions including which global issue they would speak about in front of the United Nations General Assembly, and how they would use the Miss Universe platform to empower young girls.\n \n\n   \n  “Believe in the power of your authenticity,” Bosch said. “Your dreams matter, your heart matters. Never let anyone make you doubt your worth.”\n \n\n   \n  The competition took place over three weeks, with delegates traveling around the country to rehearse and participate in events.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the beauty queens competed in the national costume showcase, which saw contestants donning flamboyant outfits designed to highlight their homelands. Miss USA, Audrey Eckert, paid homage to her home with an  elaborate bald eagle costume  designed by Simon Villalba.\n \n\n   \n  The contestant from Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, took a scary tumble during the evening gown round at Wednesday’s preliminaries and was carried away in a stretcher, according to social media videos which circulated of her fall. Miss Universe President Raul Rocha said in an  update to Instagram  that Henry was “under good care” in hospital and that she had not broken any bones.\n \n\n   \n    Pageant controversies\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Miss Universe competition was beset by controversy and internal drama in the weeks leading up to coronation night. The walk out sparked conversations over the merits of the international beauty pageant which claims to promote female empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  At a live-streamed pre-pageant meeting earlier this month, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly scolded Bosch ,  for not posting enough promotional content, appearing to call her a “dumbhead,” though Nawat denied this, insisting that he had actually accused her of causing “damage.”\n \n\n   \n  After Bosch pushed back against the insults, Nawat called security to escort her out of the room. Other contestants then stood up and walked out in solidarity.\n \n\n   \n  The incident drew global backlash, including from Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum congratulated Bosch for winning the Miss Universe title during her morning press conference in Mexico City on Friday, praising the beauty queen for standing up to one of the competition hosts.\n \n\n   \n  “What I liked about her, aside from everything else, is that she speaks up when she feels there’s an injustice against her,” Sheinbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an example for all Mexicans and for women…those old sayings at rallies, like ‘you look prettier when you’re quiet,’ are behind us,” Sheinbaum added.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization condemned Nawat’s behavior and limited his role in the pageant. Nawat apologized in a livestreamed welcome ceremony and declined to comment further on the incident to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado, was criticized for making racist comments in an Instagram live video discussing the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Machado referred to Nawat as “that despicable Chinese,” and when a commentor pointed out he is Thai, Machado said “Chinese, Thai, Korean. To me all these people with slanted eyes like this are all Chinese,” while pulling up the corners of her eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s representative did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Judge steps down, says pageant is rigged\n \n\n   \n  Two judges abruptly stepped down from the competition days before the winner was crowned, with one accusing the pageant of being rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Composer Omar Harfouch said on Instagram he had resigned from the eight-member judging panel, and claimed there was a secret, “impromptu” panel of judges who had pre-selected the top 30 contestants in advance of the final.\n \n\n   \n  “I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,” Harfouch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization said Harfouch’s claims “mischaracterize” the judging process.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,” the organization said in a  statement. \n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Makélélé, stepped down the same day, citing “unforeseen personal reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,” he said  on Instagram .\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization saw a leadership shakeup after Thai media tycoon Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip stepped down in June. Mario Búcaro was  appointed the new CEO  at the end of October, just days before delegates arrived. Jakkaphong, who is also a transgender rights advocate,  bought the organization for $20 million in 2022 , but her company  filed for bankruptcy  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Next year’s Miss Universe contest will take place in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n   This article was updated with results and details of the competition.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:38 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thursday night’s  NFL  game between the Houston Texans and Buffalo Bills was a rough and tumble affair, featuring injuries aplenty – including to one of the officials.\n \n\n   \n  Referee Adrian Hill had to be carted off the field following a non-contact injury in the third quarter of the Texans’ 23-19 win at NRG Stadium. Hill came up limping after a play and the game was stopped as medical staff looked him over before it was decided he would leave the contest.\n \n\n   \n  The referee, who was leading the officiating crew on the night, was replaced by umpire Roy Ellison, eliminating the  umpire position  for the remainder of the game.\n \n\n   \n  The rest of the evening was no less bruising, as the Texans’ vaunted defense – entering Thursday night No. 1 in scoring defense and total defense – lived up to its reputation by battering Bills QB Josh Allen and the rest of the Buffalo offense throughout the contest.\n \n\n   \n  Allen – who was coming off an  incredible six-touchdown performance  on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – had a rough night, completing 24-of-34 passes for 253 yards with two interceptions and no touchdowns and also being sacked a  career-worst eight times .\n \n\n   \n  Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said, “Credit goes to, first and foremost, our defensive line. For the way they go out, the way those guys relentlessly rush the passer and everybody on the back end is playing sound and playing together.\n \n\n   \n  “When we do that, we’re tough to move the ball against, so our players are doing an outstanding job.”\n \n\n   \n  Texans safety Calen Bullock was the standout player on the night, forcing three turnovers – two picks and a forced fumble – including the game-sealing interception with 24 seconds left in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n    Explosive first half\n \n\n   \n  The game started well for the Bills, with Buffalo taking an early 6-0 lead after James Cook cut through the middle of the Texans defense for an incredible 45-yard touchdown run.\n \n\n   \n  The teams exchanged field goals before Houston – which was playing without starting quarterback CJ Stroud for the third straight game due to concussion protocol – got a boost from its backup signal-calle. Davis Mills  threw a short, two-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Christian Kirk to put the Texans up 10-9 after the extra point.\n \n\n   \n  Bullock then nabbed his first interception of the evening, running it back for an apparent touchdown, only for a flag to have been thrown on the play on defensive end Danielle Hunter for blocking in the back. Houston ultimately settled for another field goal to extend the lead, but Buffalo hit right back off an explosive special teams play.\n \n\n   \n  Ray Davis caught the ensuing kickoff, clanging off a teammate and rolling to one side, before returning it 97 yards and front flipping into the end zone to put the Bills back on top with 1:43 left in the half.\n \n\n   \n  The fireworks weren’t done yet in the Lone Star State as the Texans ran a two-minute drill to perfection, with Mills throwing his second touchdown of the day to Jayden Higgins to cap off a six-play, 75-yard drive to put Houston up 20-16 at the half.\n \n\n   \n    Crunchtime heroics\n \n\n   \n  The third quarter began slowly with neither team doing much before Bullock came up big again. The Houston safety forced a fumble from Bills wideout Khalil Shakir after he made a catch with 4:15 left in the quarter, leading to yet another field goal from Texans kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn to make it 23-16 in favor of the home team.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills cut the lead to four after getting a field goal with 5:44 left in the game, and then came crunchtime.\n \n\n   \n  With 49 seconds left, Allen threw a pass on fourth-and-27 to Josh Palmer who then lateraled it to Shakir to convert and get the Bills dangerously close to the red zone and make the Texans faithful begin to worry.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-yard run sandwiched between two incompletions, Buffalo was facing another fourth down with the game on the line and Allen lined up in a shotgun formation. The defending league MVP dropped back and threw off his back foot, but the ball was intercepted by Houston hero Bullock, who sealed the contest with his pick.\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Texans coach Ryans expressed his relief at how the game ended, praising Bullock for his heroics: “Calen went out and intercepted the ball two times, forcing a fumble to get us in plus territory there.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of emotions going on on the sideline through that entire (final) drive, but for Calen to come down with that interception was my favorite play – because it meant it was over.”\n \n\n   \n  “A dream come true showing up on a stage like Thursday night. We are the only team on, everybody watching, the whole world watching, so a dream come true,” Bullock – who received the game ball for his performance –  told ESPN .\n \n\n   \n  With the win, Houston moves to 6-5 on the season, third in the AFC South, while the Bills drop to 7-4 and second in the AFC East, where they are in danger of falling out of reach of the surprising New England Patriots.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/entertainment/ariana-grande-covid-wicked-for-good","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:34:00-04:00","title":"The ‘Wicked: For Good’ press tour gave Ariana Grande something wicked (it’s Covid)","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the press tour for the film 'Wicked: For Good,' Ariana Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo showed strong solidarity when both fell ill with Covid-19.

of the music industry that I’ve ever seen.”\n \n\n   \n  Written by Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes and directed by Zamari, it all began in 2024 when Charli XCX was in the middle of co-headlining the “Sweat” tour with fellow singer Troye Sivan and right before she launched her “Brat” tour.\n \n\n   \n  She sent a note to Zamari, who had directed her “Guess” and “360” videos, which he described as “word vomit.”\n \n\n   \n  “It almost felt like a diary entry of, ‘This is how I feel right now,’” Zamiri said. “This feeling of having just almost got everything she could have wanted, and what that felt like on kind of a human level.”\n \n\n   \n  Thus the script was born.\n \n\n   \n  “Brat” became a cultural phenomena,  spurring not only a color obsession , but also being designated  the word of the year for 2024 by Collins Dictionary  which defined it as a person who is “characterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “Brat Summer” was even  embraced by then presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris , which nearly killed the meme and the vibes.\n \n\n   \n  The film’s cast also includes Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou,

What to know, according to a doctor \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A health condition many people have never heard of has become one of the most common liver diseases in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, often develops quietly, so many people do not realize they have it until it is more advanced and signs show up in blood tests or ultrasounds. Even then, the disease can be hard to detect.\n \n\n   \n  What  is MASLD, and why is it becoming so common? How is it diagnosed if most  people do not notice the symptoms? Who is most at risk? Can the  condition be slowed or reversed, and what treatments exist? And what  steps can people take now to protect their liver health?\n \n\n   \n  To  guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr.  Leana Wen. She is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor  at George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s  health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, or   MASLD, and why is it becoming so common? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  MASLD happens when too much fat builds up in the liver of people who often have underlying metabolic problems, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is not caused by heavy alcohol use. In the past, MASLD was called  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , and people may still hear of the condition being referred to by this name or its abbreviation, NAFLD.\n \n\n   \n  Experts now consider MASLD to be the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. It affects 30% to 40% of the adult population globally, including approximately 60% to 70% of people with type 2 diabetes and 70% to 80% of people with obesity, and roughly 1 in 3 adults in the United States, according to a  recent review in JAMA . As rates of obesity and diabetes have risen, MASLD has increased along with them.\n \n\n   \n  Most people with MASLD will not see their illness progress to severe liver disease, but a significant proportion will develop inflammation, scarring, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer over many years. The condition has already become a leading reason for liver transplantation in certain populations groups.  Moreover, this disease is closely associated with other consequences of diabetes and obesity, such as heart disease, stroke and certain cancers, so MASLD is a signal that the whole body is under metabolic strain, not just the liver.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there specific symptoms people should watch for? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Most people with MASLD have no symptoms in the early stages, which is why it often goes undiagnosed. Some may feel more tired than usual or notice vague discomfort or a feeling of fullness on the upper right side of the abdomen, but these signs are nonspecific and easy to overlook.\n \n\n   \n  As  liver damage progresses to more advanced scarring or liver failure,  symptoms become more obvious. They can include yellowing of the skin or  eyes, dark urine, swelling in the legs or abdomen, easy bruising,  confusion or severe fatigue. At that point, the liver disease is already  advanced, which is why it’s important to diagnose the condition long  before these symptoms appear.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is MASLD diagnosed if most people do not notice symptoms?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen :  In many cases, doctors first suspect MASLD when routine blood tests  show mildly abnormal liver enzymes or when an imaging study done for  another reason, such as an abdominal ultrasound, shows that the liver  looks “fatty.” Because most people don’t have symptoms, the diagnosis  depends on health care providers putting together these clues and  checking for metabolic risk factors — namely excess weight, diabetes or  prediabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  Once  physicians identify fat in the liver and rule out other causes, such as  viral hepatitis or heavy alcohol use, they check for any liver damage  or scarring. They may order specialized imaging, and in certain  circumstances, a liver biopsy may be performed. One of the key messages  from the JAMA article is that primary care clinicians caring for people  with metabolic risk factors should be thinking about liver health and  consider screening with noninvasive tools, rather than waiting until  symptoms develop.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Who is most at risk for MASLD? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  It’s  most often seen in adults who have metabolic risk factors. While  obesity is a major risk factor, the condition doesn’t only affect people  who appear overweight. Smaller “metabolically unhealthy” individuals  also can develop MASLD.\n \n\n   \n  Older  age is another risk factor, with incidence higher among those 50 and  above, though the condition also can affect children: Close to 10% of  children ages 2 to 19 have MASLD, according to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, the condition is most prevalent among Hispanic people, followed by non-Hispanic Whites and Asian Americans and less common among non-Hispanic Black individuals, the federal agency notes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Can MASLD be slowed or reversed, and what treatments exist? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The good news is that in many people, MASLD can be improved or even reversed, especially if it is caught early.\n \n\n   \n  Weight  loss is the cornerstone of treatment and can significantly reduce liver  fat and inflammation. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking  most days of the week, also helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce  liver fat.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, there were no medications specifically approved for MASLD. That is beginning to change. The US Food and Drug Administration has  approved two drugs  for MASH (metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis), the more advanced form of MASLD that includes liver inflammation and scarring. These two medicines, Rezdiffra (resmetirom) and Wegovy (semaglutide), are meant to be used along with, not instead of, lifestyle changes. There is still no drug that can fully “cure” MASLD, so diagnosing early and preventing progression remain crucial.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What steps can people take now to protect their liver health? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  For  most people, protecting the liver from MASLD is the same as protecting  overall metabolic health. Maintaining or working toward a healthy  weight, being physically active, and eating a  healthy diet  with lean proteins, whole grains and vegetables, as well as one that is low in  added sugars  and  ultraprocessed foods , all help.\n \n\n   \n  If you have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol, it is important to work with your clinician to control these conditions. Ask specifically whether your liver health has been checked. Simple blood tests can identify people who might benefit from further evaluation. And consider  other steps  to improve liver health, including avoiding excessive alcohol intake and staying up-to-date on hepatitis vaccines that protect the liver.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-epstein-mamdani-democrats-feud-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:33:00-05:00","title":"After high-profile missteps, Trump seizes on a new feud and a new potential adversary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump, following a series of political missteps related to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and economic messaging, escalates a high-stakes feud with Democrats by responding to a video from military and intelligence veterans who emphasized the obligation to obey lawful orders.

    \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:33 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Whenever Donald Trump is in political trouble, he seeks a fight and a foil.\n \n\n   \n  He will get both on Friday after one of the most misjudged weeks of his two presidencies, after his own choices eroded his political authority over  the Jeffrey Epstein scandal .\n \n\n   \n  Trump is embroiled in a  bitter new feud with Democrats  over national security, provocative rhetoric and presidential power that he  deliberately turned nuclear . And at a White House meeting Friday, he’ll go head-to-head with the next mayor of New York,  Zohran Mamdani , a democratic socialist he’s planning to brand as the unacceptable “communist” face of the Democratic Party next year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political touch deserted him in recent days. He’s heard speculation about whether his decadelong grip on the GOP base is slipping. His missteps amplified the big question over Epstein — why is he so desperate to stop the evidence coming out? And his attempt to empathize with voters over the cost of living  became a farce  when he accused Democrats of stealing the world “affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  So you just knew the president, who has gotten  more irascible by the day , would look for an opening.\n \n\n   \n  And he found it, taking the chance to ignite the kind of political storm that obliterates everything in its path, drags his outraged foes onto his preferred political ground, rallies conservative media and solidifies his base.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tried to seize back the initiative — in the inflammatory way that only he can — in a post of social media posts and reposts that culminated by a warning that a group of Democratic lawmakers were guilty of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  His fury was provoked by a video from lawmakers who — unlike the commander in chief — were veterans of the military or intelligence services reminding members of the armed services that they  do not have to obey any illegal orders .\n \n\n   \n    ‘Never in a million years …’\n \n\n   \n  By any objective measure, Trump’s response was inflammatory and disproportionate in the country’s current climate of political violence. After all, this was a president of the United States ostensibly calling for the prosecution and possible execution of members of Congress. That’s not just an affront to decency and presidential decorum; it’s an assault on the foundations of constitutional, republican government and the separation of powers.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s dangerous. Republicans accused Democrats of inciting violence after two assassination attempts against Trump and the killing of conservative icon Charlie Kirk. It’s hard to see how this is any different. The president’s comments also contrasted with the conciliatory tone of one of his erstwhile political friends, MAGA icon  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia , who apologized Sunday on CNN for her role in “toxic politics.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the Democrats who appears in the video expressed her shock.\n \n\n   \n  “I never in a million years, thought I’d be talking to you tonight about the fact that the president of the United States has called for my death by hanging for sedition and treason. And called for it because I and a number of other people published a video that says you have to follow the law,” Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, loves these kinds of fights.\n \n\n   \n  By any normal political standards, they’d be potential career enders for a top political figure. But Trump uses them, as he did Thursday, to get Democrats to make arguments in defense of institutions, the Constitution, civility and traditional presidential behavior. Their points are often well made. But they can often seem esoteric and off-topic to voters far from Washington who are more concerned with economic security or the cost of health care. In recent elections, Democratic warnings about Trump fracturing norms and legal constraints and threatening the “soul” of the nation haven’t always worked.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the controversies whip up Trump’s conservative media cheerleaders and activists and sets up a loyalty test for Republicans wary of breaking with him.\n \n\n   \n  The country has seen it all before, multiple times: In Trump’s racist “birther” campaign against President Barack Obama; in his mockery of the late Sen. John McCain’s war record; in his false claims that he won the 2020 election. It’s a technique that has often worked for Trump. He might alienate half the country, but it’s one of the keys to his staunch support from his GOP base and his capacity to always portray himself as an anti-establishment scourge and an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  One question now, however, amid some of his worst-ever approval ratings and struggles with the economy, is whether Trump’s antics may begin to disgust even some voters who have always stood by him.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans face familiar political dodgeball\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s bombshell was typical of the distraction tactics that Trump has always used and that some of his critics have sometimes accused the news media of repeatedly falling for. Yet Trump’s “distraction” gambits are often so unhinged or threatening to basic American values that it’s inevitable that they create huge shock and fierce debate. They require pushback from his opponents, even if it dilutes their messages.\n \n\n   \n  As usual, Trump’s detonation of a new controversy forced Republicans on Capitol Hill to dance on the head of a political pin, with some deploying the classic excuse that they hadn’t read the posts.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson gingerly tried to separate himself from the president’s comments, saying the words “are not the ones that I would use.” He told CNN’s Manu Raju that “obviously, I don’t think that this is… these are crimes punishable by death or any of that.”\n \n\n   \n  Another close Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the president’s comments were “over the top.” And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the legality of administration attacks on alleged drug-trafficker boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, said he didn’t think it was a “good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked whether the president really wanted the execution of members of Congress. She replied: “No.” But true to Trump’s lifetime mantra, she counterattacked, sketching an argument other Republicans adopted that the video was an attempt to get members of the armed forces to disobey the commander in chief.\n \n\n   \n  This is a misrepresentation. But it created sufficient political heat to blur reality while making the president’s out-of-bounds outburst seem just like one side of a political back-and-forth. Johnson, for instance, said that what the legislators did was “unprecedented in American history, and it should be called out, and that’s what the president has expressed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some might question why the Democrats chose to make their video — and to give the president an opportunity to change the subject after he’s spent days flailing over the Epstein matter and the cost of living. And any political move involving the military risks creating a drama that leaves servicemembers in the middle of a partisan firestorm.\n \n\n   \n  A counterargument would be that there is deep concern among many lawmakers — one that is especially acute for combat veterans — that Trump will ask service members to undertake unlawful attacks and missions. This is not hypothetical.  As CNN’s Aaron Blake reported , there have been many occasions when Trump’s foreign policy or military ventures have raised questions of legality.\n \n\n   \n  Judges have often ruled that administration policies infringed the law. Trump has sent troops into American cities on questionable grounds. His actions near Venezuela have many on Capitol Hill fearing an illegal war. And his threats of retribution need to be taken seriously since he’s turned the Justice Department into his engine of personal retribution.\n \n\n   \n  And after all, the Democrats in the video were only restating a principle that every servicemember understands — even if the question of deciding whether an order is a legal or not can be fraught and imprecise during the fog of war.\n \n\n   \n    High-stakes White House showdown looms\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Mamdani at the White House on Friday is high stakes for both men.\n \n\n   \n  Both are New Yorkers; both won power through populist politics. Each harnessed a political moment and won power against insider, establishment elites.\n \n\n   \n  But while presidential power dwarfs that of a mere mayor-to-be, some comparisons may also be unflattering to Trump, who at 79 is closer to the end of his political career than the 34-year-old Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made his intentions clear with Mamdani. He’s setting up the mayor-elect as a political foil and a symbol of all Democrats to try to dispute their party’s more mainstream credentials ahead of the midterm elections next year. “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting,” Trump said on his Truth Social network on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The president threatened during the mayoral campaign to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won because “as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Mamdani is not a communist, and anyone who understands the deprivations and tyranny of communist rule in the Soviet Union and elsewhere would see the comparison as absurd.

  \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior citizens are the latest group of Americans to face steep increases in their health insurance premiums for 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Part B premiums will jump nearly 10% next year, the largest increase in  four years  and second-largest hike, in dollar terms, in the program’s history. The standard monthly premium will be $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from this year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That will eat up nearly one-third of the $56 monthly  Social Security cost-of-living adjustment  that retirees will receive in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The steep increase in premiums for Medicare Part B — which covers doctors’ visits, outpatient hospital services, medical equipment and drugs administered by physicians, among other services — comes at a time when health insurance premiums are rising sharply for those with  job-based coverage  and  Affordable Care Act policies.  This upward trend puts more pressure on Americans already struggling with affordability as the prices of  food ,  utilities  and other necessities remain stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “In a world in which people are concerned about the affordability of health care and all other needs, it’s pretty distressing that this increase is so large,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at The Century Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs, as well as usage, are common drivers of the rise in health care premiums across coverage types.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare is also contending with the continuing wave of baby boomers becoming eligible to enroll, plus the ongoing shift toward surgeries and other medical services being performed at outpatient facilities, rather than in hospitals, where care is covered by Medicare Part A, said Rachel Schmidt, research professor at Georgetown University’s Medicare Policy Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  CMS noted that monthly premiums would have risen by another $11 had it not approved a change in payment for skin substitutes that the agency says will reduce spending by nearly 90% on the wound care products. Medicare shelled out more than $10 billion for these products last year, up from $256 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Medicare Part D prescription drug policies, which are offered by insurers, will see fewer changes for 2026 than they did for this year. The Biden administration had to rush last fall to stand up a  multibillion-dollar subsidy program  for insurers to prevent steep premium increases stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act. The law, which the Democrat-led Congress approved in 2022, required insurers to be on the hook for more of the drug costs once enrollees hit the catastrophic coverage phase above  a $2,000 cap .\n \n\n   \n  The number of plans being offered for 2026 will decrease modestly, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which noted that Elevance is exiting the market. Many insurers are hiking their premiums by as much as $50 for next year, though some are lowering them or holding them steady.\n \n\n   \n  “If seniors in the standalone PDP market are willing to shop, there is still stability,” said Brooks Conway, a principal at Oliver Wyman.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 69 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, which also covers people with disabilities. The annual open enrollment period ends December 7.\n \n\n   \n    Medicare Advantage market retrenches\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Advantage, which covers just over half of Medicare beneficiaries, is going through a second year of  major changes . The overhaul is being spurred by medical costs outpacing reimbursements from the federal government, which pays insurers to offer coverage to Medicare enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  Many enrollees will have to search for new coverage for 2026 since the number of offerings is tumbling 10% to 3,373 plans, according to Oliver Wyman. Major insurers, including CVS Aetna, Elevance, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, are reducing their plan options in at least 100 counties. The changes are expected to affect just over 2 million people.\n \n\n   \n  (These figures do not include special needs plans that cater to enrollees with chronic conditions or those who are dually eligible for Medicaid. These plans will have more offerings for 2026 than they did this year.)\n \n\n   \n  In certain counties, there will be fewer policies offered with $0 premiums and fewer PPO plans, which have wider provider networks, said Greg Berger, a partner at Oliver Wyman. Insurers are primarily seeking to exit or scale back their less profitable products and geographic areas.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of MAPD plans are trying not to grow,” Berger said, referring to Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  And for the first time, some Americans will have no Medicare Advantage plans to choose from. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and UnitedHealthcare decided to discontinue their coverage in the Green Mountain State, leaving traditional Medicare as the only option for residents in eight counties.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even with the pullbacks, most Medicare beneficiaries will have an array of options in 2026 — 39 plans, on average, down from 42 plans this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to a broad range of affordable coverage options in 2026,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, CMS’ administrator, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Also, fewer plans will offer $0 deductibles for prescription drugs, while maximum out-of-pocket limits for medical care are rising $490, or about 10%, on average. Among Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage that have a monthly premium, the average premium will increase to $66 next year, up from $60 this year.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the supplemental benefits that Medicare Advantage offers enrollees, such as funds for over-the-counter medicines, dental care and vision services, are getting skimpier. The dental allowance, for instance, is declining 10% to $2,107, on average, Berger said.\n \n\n   \n  The current disruptions in the market, however, don’t mean that Medicare Advantage will continue to shrink. Over the longer term, the program is still an attractive market for insurers, Schmidt said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going away any time soon,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/transgender-cancer-registries-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-05:00","title":"US cancer registries, constrained by Trump policies, to recognize only ‘male’ or ‘female’ patients","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration’s policy of restricting government recognition to only 'male' and 'female' sexes has led to federal cancer registries, including those funded by the CDC and NCI, to remove data options for transgender individuals.

Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.\n \n\n   \n  The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute  will categorize cancer patients  as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.\n \n\n   \n  Registries  currently specify  whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump in January issued an  executive order  stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.\n \n\n   \n  “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.\n \n\n   \n    Missing the big picture\n \n\n   \n  Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n  For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents  97% of the U.S. population . The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering  nearly half  the U.S. population.\n \n\n   \n  The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.\n \n\n   \n  For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying  rising rates of colorectal cancer  among people  younger than 50 . As a result, U.S. guidelines  now recommend  that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.\n \n\n   \n  States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women.  The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas  initiated a statewide effort  aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”\n \n\n   \n  The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.\n \n\n   \n  For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.\n \n\n   \n  The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Backwards’ progress\n \n\n   \n  NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.\n \n\n   \n  According to an  analysis of CDC data  by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.\n \n\n   \n  “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were  two to three times  as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.\n \n\n   \n  A  Canadian study  concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a  2023 study  from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.\n \n\n   \n  Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and  stopping specialized services  for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.\n \n\n   \n  Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”\n \n\n   \n   KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF  — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/football-nfl-kickoffs-chiefs-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:57:00-05:00","title":"President Trump ‘doesn’t even know what he’s looking at’ on NFL kickoffs, says Chiefs assistant","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump criticized the NFL's new dynamic kickoff rule, claiming it is unsafe and damaging to the game's pageantry, despite the league asserting that the rule improves safety and increases excitement.

teams coach Dave Toub doesn’t care a whole lot about what President Donald Trump thinks of new kickoff rules that were implemented by the  NFL  in an attempt to make the play safer and more exciting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since Jimmy Carter in 1978 when he attended a game between the Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Two days later, Trump appeared on “The Pat McAfee Show” and torched the league’s  dynamic kickoff rule , which owners voted to make permanent this year. Under the rule, the ball is kicked from the 35-yard line, but every player on the kicking team must wait at the 40 until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20-yard line.\n \n\n   \n  There are also rules for if a ball does not reach the landing zone, hits the landing zone without being caught or lands in the end zone.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so demeaning, and I think it hurts the game. It hurts the pageantry,” Trump said. “I’ve told that to (NFL Commissioner) Roger Goodell, and I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The league has maintained the dynamic kickoff system is safer while producing more kickoff returns. And Toub, who has spent more than two decades coaching special teams in Chicago and Kansas City, didn’t hold back Thursday when he was asked what he thought of the president’s pointed criticism of the kickoff rules.\n \n\n   \n  “He doesn’t even know what he’s looking at. He has no idea what’s going on with the kickoff rule,” said the normally reserved Toub, his voice rising.\n \n\n   \n  “So take that for what it’s worth.

Eric Swalwell announced Thursday he will enter the California gubernatorial race, joining a crowded field of candidates looking to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Swalwell, a longtime  adversary  of President Donald Trump, announced his run on his campaign website just before his appearance on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n \n\n   \n  “I came here tonight, Jimmy, to tell you and your audience that I am running to be the next governor of California,” Swalwell said.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be California’s fighter and protector,” Swalwell said in a  statement  on his website. “Our state is under attack. The President has militarized our streets, canceled cancer research, zeroed out clean energy climate projects, and is chasing our immigrant friends and neighbors through their workplaces, kids’ schools, and houses of worship.”\n \n\n   \n  No clear frontrunner has yet taken a lead in the primary. Swalwell’s entrance marks the latest turn in a contest that has remained in constant flux as politicians have declined to run, dropped out, or seen their campaigns marred in controversy.\n \n\n   \n  Former Vice President  Kamala Harris , a former California senator and attorney general, announced in late July that she would not run for governor. Former legislative leader Toni Atkins and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis left the race earlier this year. And former Rep. Katie Porter’s campaign faltered after videos of her getting upset during an interview and yelling at a staffer went viral.\n \n\n   \n  Porter’s campaign stumble created a window for Sen. Alex Padilla, a known entity who was elected statewide in 2022 after being appointed to the seat in 2020. But the senator passed on the seat in early November, stating that he was committed to continuing his work in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Other prominent candidates include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra; Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco; former Fox News host Steve Hilton; and the billionaire Democratic activist and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Newsom, who was first elected in 2018, is term-limited.\n \n\n   \n  Swalwell rose to prominence during President Donald Trump’s first term, when he became a key antagonist of the president from his perch on the House Intelligence Committee. He, along with now-Senator Adam Schiff, was kicked off the committee when Republicans retook control of the US House in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The seven-term congressman also made a brief run for president in 2019, on a platform focused on gun control and the party’s need for generational change.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-05:00","title":"Rescuers continue to recover bodies from rubble, days after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly Russian airstrike on two apartment buildings in Ternopil, western Ukraine, killed at least 31 people, including several children, prompting ongoing recovery operations and international concern.

apartment buildings in western Ukraine earlier this week, killing at least 31 people including several children, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s emergency service said Thursday that people were still missing after the airstrikes on two apartment blocks in the western city of Ternopil. On Friday, three more bodies were recovered, including those of two children. Ukraine’s interior minister said the strikes may have wiped out entire families.\n \n\n   \n  The large-scale Russian attack overnight Tuesday was one of the deadliest to target western Ukraine since the start of the conflict and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Russia “will never stop on its own,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram, urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel’s son was in a ninth-story apartment in the building at the time of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions. I called him and said, ‘Bohdan, go to the shelter, get dressed.’ He answered, ‘Mom, I am already up. Everything will be fine,’” she said   Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s attacks have mostly targeted the eastern part of the country and large cities such as Kyiv, and many Ukrainians have fled to the west.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles during the attack. The buildings in Ternopil were most likely hit by Russia’s powerful Kh-101 cruise missile, which is designed to avoid air defenses and is equipped with an advanced precision guiding system, they said.   \n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Defense Ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation were in Ukraine on Thursday for meetings with officials following reports that Russia and the US were working on peace proposals that call for Ukraine to cede land and reduce the size of its army.\n \n\n   \n  Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told CNN that any peace plan would have to involve Europe and leave Ukraine with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Poland is a neighbor of both Russia and Ukraine, and the (European Union) is helping Ukraine more, including militarily, than the US, and also financially more than the US.

Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the US State Department approved a possible $105 million sale that would allow Ukraine to upgrade its Patriot air defense system – a critical shield against Russian aerial attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s ability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust local sustainment capability,” said a Pentagon statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Zelensky struck a deal during a visit to Paris to purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/style/wicked-for-good-costume-design-paul-tazewell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:10:00.000Z","title":"A witch in trousers?

Costume designer Paul Tazewell, who won an Academy Award for his work, explains that the change reflects Elphaba's journey from a marginalized, ostracized figure to one who asserts her autonomy and self-worth. The decision to adopt trousers is thematically tied to historical movements such as the 19th-century bloomers movement and the 20th-century adoption of trousers by women like Coco Chanel, Katherine Hepburn, and Marlene Dietrich, all of whom were associated with modernity, strength, and independence. The film’s portrayal of witches, especially Elphaba, moves beyond archetypal, villainous imagery to become a powerful allegory for empowerment, racial identity, and resistance against unjust systems. By wearing trousers, Elphaba not only gains physical mobility but also embodies a deeper cultural message: that true power lies in self-acceptance, self-expression, and the courage to challenge societal expectations.","keyTakeAways":["The portrayal of Elphaba in 'Wicked: For Good' wearing trousers represents a shift in how witch figures are depicted in modern pop culture, symbolizing

Weird \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In popular culture, the archetypal look of a witch is a female figure generally depicted wearing a black dress, robe, or cloak. Typically, she also sports a pointed hat and carries a broomstick that doubles as her mode of transport. It’s an image that was largely solidified by the 1939 film “The Wizard of Oz,” featuring the Wicked Witch of the West, despite a belief in witches and witchcraft that has long existed in many cultures worldwide for centuries.\n \n\n   \n  As “Wicked: For Good,” the sequel to the modern film adaptation directed by Jon M. Chu, releases in cinemas, eagle-eyed viewers may notice a subtle difference in the witchy protagonist, Elphaba, played by Cynthia Erivo. Devotees, fear not: She still has green skin and an all-encompassing uniform of black. However, for the first time, the character wears trousers. Slim fit and very discrete, they’re worn by Elphaba as she appears in the opening scene, swooping down from the sky to thwart the plight of animals, and throughout the film, as she’s on the run from a mob of angry townspeople on a witch hunt.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a style choice, a thematic one,” according to Paul Tazewell, the costume designer for both “Wicked” (for which he  won an Oscar this year ) and “Wicked: For Good.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from his home in Brooklyn, New York, Tazewell — who worked on the costumes for both films simultaneously — recounts Elphaba’s outfits in the first, from the black pinafore she wears as a little girl when she mourns the death of her mother, to the long, tailored coatdress with puffed sleeves seen on her arrival at Shiz University as a reserved young woman. Her whole life, “she’s othered because of the color of her skin,” said Tazewell. “She’s an oddity within the community.” That kind of prejudice is enough to make any introvert become more reticent. Yet, Elphaba doesn’t — a retaliation that is expressed through her clothes, which she “protects and armors” herself with, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the first film ends, Elphaba is seen parting ways with Glinda, the benevolent good witch played by Ariana Grande, and the decision to introduce trousers was made as her new environment required her to be more agile. “She’s in exile in the forest, so she only has access to certain things. Her dress is in tatters at this point,” said Tazewell. “We moved away from a dress silhouette to one where she can be active and also give more presence.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, while trousers allow Elphaba to move more freely, it is also indicative of her newfound liberation. “It really is about self-expression,” Tazewell continued. “Elphaba has decided that she sees herself as the most important thing, and finding and having a connection to that self-love is her drive. It’s where her power lies.”\n \n\n   \n    A marker of independence\n \n\n   \n  Modern depictions of witches in pop culture range from Roald Dahl’s 1983 book of the same name, which portrayed witches as gruesome creatures without hair or fingernails, to more glamorous or gothic interpretations seen via Maleficent of “Sleeping Beauty” and  the witches of “Suspiria.”  Others, such as “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” Hermione Granger in “Harry Potter,” the sisters in “Charmed,” and Bonnie in “The Vampire Diaries,” appear entirely normal, taking on the guise of an ordinary girl next door.\n \n\n   \n  But Elphaba is different in that she is neither ghastly nor glam. Her impact is more figurative, as she serves as a symbol of empowerment, primarily through her unwavering moral conviction and courage to defy unjust societal expectations. For some experts, there are parallels that can be drawn between Elphaba’s liberation in the new film and the kind women experienced in the mid-19th century when they started entering traditionally male-dominated spaces like the workplace and began wearing trousers more publicly.\n \n\n   \n  One of the earliest iterations were floaty, wide-legged shorts known as “bloomers” — popularized by the early suffragist Amelia Bloomer, they were worn as undergarments and allowed for greater comfort and freedom of movement. The garment’s rise coincided with the adoption of once strictly male activities like riding a bicycle. But, despite its benefits, it “quickly drew ridicule because people thought it was so shocking and distracting from the cause,” said April C. Armstrong, who co-curated a recent exhibition at Princeton University contextualizing  women’s fashion in the 19th and 20th centuries . Bloomers have since become fashionable and are no longer treated as underwear, as seen on  the high fashion runways  and worn by celebrities like  the pop star Dua Lipa .\n \n\n   \n  However, women did not universally start wearing trousers until the 20th century, when Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel started popularizing them in her collections (the designer liked wearing pants herself and  often borrowed them from her male lovers ). Silver screen stars including Katherine Hepburn, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich, who all wore trousers, helped to create its association with a “modern, independent and spirited” woman, said Rhonda Garelick, the founding director of Hofstra’s Institute for Public Humanities and the Arts. “In trousers, women can not only ride a bicycle, but they can play sports; they can walk more quickly; they can get in and out of vehicles,” continued Garelick. “We tend to forget it was much more difficult for women, and to this day, I think a woman wearing trousers is still associated with independence.”\n \n\n   \n    More than meets the eye\n \n\n   \n  When it came to creating the looks for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good,” Tazewell — whose historic win of the Academy Award’s best costume design made him the first Black man to take home the prize — placed great emphasis on ensuring harmony between the central characters, especially when Elphaba had a greater risk of being overshadowed by Glinda’s more colorful, frothy gowns. And while black is a color that typically struggles to jump off the screen, Elphaba never disappears into the background.\n \n\n   \n  This can be credited to Tazewell’s choice of sumptuous textures and rich fabrics. “When something is light and pink and what we call pretty, it is easier to make that look elevated and glamorous, but with black, elements can get lost,” he said. “What I was relying on is the depth that was created, whether it was in the micro-pleating that created an undulating pattern on her Emerald City dress, or her sweeping trench coat, which is made of a wax cotton that is water repellent” — a significant detail given the belief among the film’s townsfolk that water makes Elphaba melt.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematography was also an important consideration, he added, as “light reflects different textures in different ways.” He explained: “If it’s wool and felted, it will soak in. If it’s pleated, then we catch the depth of the pleats in the way it’s lit. In both films, we used an underlayer of color underneath Elphaba’s sheer black to give a more iridescent quality.”\n \n\n   \n  But, as is typical of Tazewell’s work, there’s always greater meaning beyond the aesthetic. In “Wicked: For Good,” not only has Elphaba adopted trousers as part of her silhouette, but she has “a swaggering presence because she has knee high boots with a slightly higher heel. The brim of her hat becomes a little more extreme,” said Tazewell — symbolizing a refusal to adhere to societal rules and expectations. Elphaba may be ostracized, but that won’t stop her from commanding attention and taking up space. Unlike Glinda, whose delicate dresses nipped in the waist, feel like the opposite of that, as she seeks to maintain her idealized image.\n \n\n   \n  For Tazewell, those nuances are key. “The spark point for me really was when Cynthia was cast as Elphaba,” he said. “It’s fueled by the fact that we have a Black woman playing a role about a woman who is vilified for the color of her skin, and the choices she makes to empower herself, to go towards what she feels is right and true. That speaks of humanity and how we relate to each other.” It may be why the story, which began as a book before being turned into a hit Broadway musical and film, has resonated with so many audiences, he said. “‘Wicked’ is unlike any other American tale that we have. It operates as an allegory for the modern systems that we have — around power, around self-evolution, and also around advocation for animals and the environment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/discharge-petitions-congress-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"The success of the forced Epstein files vote is emboldening some Republicans to go it alone","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The successful push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files has emboldened Republican members of Congress, including Rep.

\nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson may want to put the Jeffrey Epstein saga behind him, but some Republicans saw rank-and-file members’ success in forcing Tuesday’s vote as an opportunity to push their own legislative priorities to the floor — even if it doesn’t have leadership’s blessing.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has put House Republican leaders on notice that unless they change their approach to a bipartisan bill banning lawmaker stock trading, she will circumvent them using a discharge petition and force a vote herself.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent interview in her office, the Florida Republican told CNN the overwhelming support from lawmakers to release the Jeffrey Epstein files should encourage more members to take advantage of the leadership-bucking tool that made the vote possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think more members need to use it,” Luna said. “More members need to get outside of this mentality that you have to go and ask for permission from leadership to bring legislation. That’s not why you’re here. And that defeats the purpose of why you call yourself a representative. If you want to be a follower, call yourself a follower of Congress, but not a representative of Congress if you’re not doing your job.”\n \n\n   \n  Typically, the majority party’s leadership team dictates floor activity, setting the calendar for which bills are brought and when.\n \n\n   \n  Discharge petitions face many procedural hurdles (to start, it requires 218 signatures — a majority of all 435 members, rather than a majority of members present) and rarely lead to an actual vote.\n \n\n   \n  It’s even more unusual for a member to deploy the tactic when their own party is in power. But in a fractured Washington with razor-thin margins in the House, there are signs lawmakers may consider the strategy more seriously.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Don Bacon recently signed onto a discharge petition to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers after President Donald Trump  signed  an executive order ending the practice. That petition just clinched the necessary 218 signatures needed to move forward toward a vote on the House floor. And this week, Bacon told CNN he is preparing to help launch another petition that would push for more aid to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I respect the speaker and the majority leader drive the agenda. But the discharge petition process enables us to push member-driven initiatives to the floor for a vote,” Bacon said.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who also signed onto the workers’ rights petition, said “it’s is certainly being viewed by members individuals as a tool in their disposal.” Still, he said, their use is “still very limited and it really depends on the issue.”\n \n\n   \n  This year alone, lawmakers have brought 10 discharge petitions, with the Epstein files push standing as the most notable. Last Congress, under Republican control, 20 discharge petitions were filed, after 18 the Congress before. By contrast in the 116th Congress, from 2019-2020, only 5 such attempts were made. Only a handful became law.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had long tried to block the Epstein discharge petition from coming to the floor and strongly criticized the use of the tool to force a vote, even though he ultimately supported the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Discharge petitions are never a good idea. In the House, it is a tool of the minority party, not the majority,” Johnson said in July.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Acknowledging Johnson’s argument, Luna said, “A discharge petition is simply a legislative tool where we actually can collect signatures to bring something to the floor. It’s kind of an old school way of legislating.”\n \n\n   \n  And the tool has helped her clinch legislative wins. The congresswoman’s threat of bringing a discharge petition helped her  reach an agreement  with Johnson in their standoff over proxy voting for new parents, an issue that had paralyzed the House.\n \n\n   \n  “I will protect the discharge petition with every bone in my body,” Luna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    New push to ban stock trading\n \n\n   \n  Now, Luna is prepared to use the same strategy to ensure the bipartisan push to ban stock trading of lawmakers, their spouses and their dependent children becomes law as pressure has escalated for elected officials to weed out corruption and restore public trust in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long-traded stocks and seeking a ban has been a yearslong pursuit. But Luna says that she is running into new roadblocks that are clouding the process.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of taking up the bipartisan bill that has 95 cosponsors, Luna said she has been informed that leadership wants to pursue their own bill and that members would not be allowed to add their own amendments.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just not feeling that this has been an open and honest process,” Luna said. “And so, I will make that decision collectivity with the other members who signed on.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Luna said that House Speaker Mike Johnson has been understanding throughout this process, but she is giving leadership until Friday to address the issue with her.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, I understand that he also has to manage other people and there’s a lot of personalities,” Luna said of Johnson. “This is not a popular topic on the Hill. In fact, it’s made me very unpopular within the House of Representatives but very popular among the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Even with the Friday deadline, Luna says her discharge petition is ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s filed, so it means it’s baked, so I can call it up whenever. And that’s the element of surprise that we like to keep people on our toes. So it’s ready to go,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/alabama-public-libraries-books-transgender-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:42:00-05:00","title":"Alabama Board Votes to Remove Transgender-Related Books from Public Library Youth Sections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Alabama Public Library Service Board of Directors voted to remove books discussing transgender identity, gender ideology, or multiple genders from youth and children's sections of public libraries, relocating them to adult sections.

She said state regulations do not allow the purchase of books aimed at children if state regulations also deem the book inappropriate for children.\n \n\n   \n  “So long term they are banning these books, slowly removing these books from your public library,” Hayden said.\n \n\n   \n  The board also tightened restrictions on youth library cards, stating that the “standard library card” for minors cannot access books in adult collections. Libraries can issue an all-access card only with the written permission of parents.\n \n\n   \n  Board members also had sharp disagreements over restoring funding to the Fairhope Public Library.

his secret million-dollar stash \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:45 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Canadian man has lost his 16-year legal battle to get back more than 1.2 million Canadian dollars he had stored in bizarre locations around his home.\n \n\n   \n  On December 1, 2009, police visited Marcel Breton’s rural property on the outskirts of Thunder Bay, a city in northwest Ontario, looking for an illegal handgun,  according to court documents. \n \n\n   \n  There, they made an unusual discovery: 15,000 Canadian dollars’ worth of bills in the floor heating ducts of the living room, about 32,000 dollars stored in locations around the garage, and over 1.2 million worth of Canadian bills in a rubber tub buried in the ground under the garage.\n \n\n   \n  All up, the stash was worth 1.19 million US dollars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Police also found a variety of drugs, including cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy, and told Canadian media at the time that they were “flabbergasted.”\n \n\n   \n  Breton was charged with various offences, including possession of the proceeds of crime, and was initially convicted. But in a retrial, he successfully argued the search of his property wasn’t lawful, and he was acquitted.\n \n\n   \n  But then came the matter of what to do with all of the money.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, an Ontario appeals court upheld a 2023 ruling that decided the lion’s share of the money should go to the government.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court noted the trial judge, Justice Bruce Fitzpatrick, remarked that it was “unusual for an average person to have such a large amount of money buried in tubs underneath their property.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted that the most common type of bill found in the bundles was 20 Canadian dollars, which is the most common denomination associated with the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Breton had not reported any income to the Canada Revenue Agency between 2001 and 2008, the documents said.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also did not buy Breton’s justifications for why he had so much cash – that he had won it in a lottery or casino, or had earned it from his vehicle repair business.\n \n\n   \n  The trial judge then ordered that most of the money be handed over to the government, a decision the appeals court affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Sanaa Ahmed, assistant professor of law at the University of Calgary, said the case is an example of “legalistic hair-splitting.”\n \n\n   \n  “Confronted with facts such as these, courts will often find ways to justify confiscating monies and thus ‘punishing’ the accused, even though they may have been acquitted otherwise,” she told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, as societies, we’re growing increasingly comfortable with breaking some rules to catch the so-called ‘bad guys,’” Ahmed added. “But we forget that we made those rules precisely to avoid subjective, normative judgements by those who found themselves in judicial office.”\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Gallant, professor of law at the University of Manitoba, said in this case, the onus is on Breton to prove the money was obtained legally, noting “cash is the currency of illegal drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “What legitimate source might underlie dollars stuffed in a barrel and buried?  Why bury it?  Each day, at the very least, you would even bank interest,” Gallant said.\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t all bad news for Breton. The appeals court upheld Fitzpatrick’s prior ruling that Breton gets to keep 15,000 Canadian dollars which was found inside the vents of the home, since the judge couldn’t rule out that that cash had been obtained lawfully. In today’s money, that’s worth just over $10,600.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-proposal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"Trump’s 28-Point Peace Proposal for Ukraine Would Require Land Concessions and Military Reduction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A draft 28-point peace proposal from the Trump administration outlines a plan to end the war in Ukraine, requiring significant territorial concessions — including recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as de facto Russian territory — and a reduction of Ukraine’s military to 600,000 personnel.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A new  Trump administration plan  for the end of the war in Ukraine would see Kyiv cede territory to Russia, US “de facto” recognition of Crimea and other Ukrainian territory forcibly seized by the Kremlin as Russian, and limits to the size of Ukraine’s military, according to a draft of the plan obtained Thursday by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The draft’s veracity was confirmed to CNN by a US official. Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations by Ukraine and European officials and would be seen as concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  US officials said the plan was still being worked on, and that any final agreement would require concessions from both sides, not just Ukraine. Some of the points being circulated now – including some that appear weighted toward Moscow’s demands – are not final, officials said, and will almost certainly evolve. During a Thursday afternoon briefing, the White House press secretary said the plan remained “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  After meeting a top US military official in Kyiv on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to work with the Trump administration on the new plan, saying in a social media post that he was prepared for “constructive, honest and swift work” to achieve peace.\n \n\n   \n  However, Moscow had not yet been informed that Zelensky was ready to discuss the plan,   a Russian journalist cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying, state media reported Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan, which President Donald Trump has reviewed and supports, is the White House’s latest attempt to bring  Russia’s war in Ukraine  to an end. Some of the proposal’s provisions – including territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia – have previously been nonstarters with the Ukrainians. But US officials see a new window of opportunity to restart peace discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The plan is still in the framework stage, and its many points haven’t been finalized.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the draft plan\n \n\n   \n  Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, the draft describes the plan’s implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “Sanctions will be imposed for violations,” it states.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan would have Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States.” This would mark a stunning reversal of longstanding US policy to acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity and not recognize forcible changes in territory.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan says Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact, “which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions,” it says.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan states that Russian forces will not enter the demilitarized zone. The two countries would commit not to change the agreed-upon territorial arrangements by force, or else security guarantees would not apply.\n \n\n   \n  The security guarantees, which the plan says Ukraine will receive, are not detailed in the draft. However, it notes that the US will receive compensation for its guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  If Russia invades Ukraine, “in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked,” the draft states.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid,” it notes.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, and that European fighter jets be stationed in Poland.\n \n\n   \n  It limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel. It also calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the creation of a joint US-Russia “working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  It outlines a return of Russia into the global community, including the lifting of sanctions, invitation to rejoin the G8, and its reintegration into the global economy.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would see “all parties” in the war “receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court for the crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children. The plan calls for the return of “all civilian detainees and hostages,” including children, and the exchange of all prisoners of war and bodies.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to “be launched under the supervision of the IAEA, and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has made it very clear since day one, and even on the campaign trail, that he wants to see this war come to an end. He has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides of this war, Russia and Ukraine alike, for their refusal to commit to a peace agreement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing. “Nevertheless, the president and his national security team are steadfast in seeing this war come to an end.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan was overly weighted toward Moscow, and said the administration had “talked equally with both sides” to create it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine, and we believe that it should be acceptable to both sides, and we’re working very hard to get it done,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Wednesday the document was a “list of potential ideas” rather than a completed proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he wrote in  a post on X.  “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some of the provisions being floated are likely to draw criticism from Ukraine and its backers since it would require significant land concessions. The two regions that  form the Donbas , Luhansk and Donetsk, are still partially held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal echoes a  peace proposal from talks  in Istanbul in the early weeks of the war in 2022, repeating some of Moscow’s wider geopolitical demands about Ukraine’s armed forces and allegiances.\n \n\n   \n    Talks in Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Thursday and delivered him the Trump administration’s proposed peace plan, a US defense official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll and Zelensky discussed “a collaborative plan to achieve peace in Ukraine” and “agreed on an aggressive timeline for signature,” the defense official said. The official clarified that the US expected Zelensky to sign a framework with the US to work toward an eventual peace agreement, not sign onto a final peace deal itself.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how aggressive that timeline is, or whether Zelensky agreed to its points. European and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday that the plan appears to contain unacceptable and maximalist demands from Russia, including ceding territory in the eastern Donbas region that Russia does not even currently control.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ukrainian presidential office said Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President of Ukraine outlined the fundamental principles that matter to our people, and following today’s meeting, the parties agreed to work on the plan’s provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war,” the Ukrainian presidential office said, adding that Zelensky expects to speak with Trump in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why the Army was tasked with delivering the peace plan rather than diplomats, the defense official said the Army “comes from a trusted position” with the Ukrainians, and is also in Ukraine to hold meetings on battlefield innovation — a topic Driscoll has been deeply involved in throughout his tenure as secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “We come from a trusted position. The US Army is a proven Ukraine ally,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundhog Day’\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat echoed a Western official’s description of some of the details of the proposal. The person told CNN that the new effort, which repeats many of Moscow’s maximalist demands dating back to 2022, reminded them of “Groundhog Day,” a film in which events repeat themselves over and over.\n \n\n   \n  A European envoy based in Ukraine said the plan had caught the diplomatic community completely by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been gone through before and rejected, and now we’re back to square one,” the diplomat said. “For the Ukrainians, it is just a non-starter and with good reason. It would just be inviting the Russians to come back again at a future date. It would be political suicide for any Ukrainian leader (to accept it), and it would be military suicide to hand over that fortified area.”\n \n\n   \n  The diplomat also described foreign ministries in Europe and elsewhere calling contacts in Washington for guidance on the plan only to be told they were equally in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  “We have heard directly from people in the State Department and on Capitol Hill that nobody knew anything about this plan until it was leaked yesterday,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  “People who should have known about it, knew nothing about it … There’s a lot of annoyance and confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In her first public comments since reports of the plan emerged, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters Thursday that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile, told CNN that any plans should involve Europe and leave Kyiv with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a much bigger stake in this than the US, and therefore Ukraine, but also Europe, has to be involved,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said work on the talks was continuing “at the technical level between the teams” and that they were “carefully studying all of our partners’ proposals, expecting the same respectful attitude towards Ukraine’s position.”\n \n\n   \n  Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, told the Washington Post Live, “This is the start of a good process.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re finally having the leadership of the president of the United States, and this leadership is backed up by a real process, I think this is serious,” she said.   \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s special envoy,  Steve Witkoff , has been leading the effort, CNN reported on Wednesday, with a source saying the negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal. A US official said Witkoff had been quietly working on the plan for a month, with input from both the Ukrainians and the Russians on the terms they could accept.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, reiterated its denial that it was working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine, saying Thursday there were “no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have nothing new to add to what was said in Anchorage,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, referencing a meeting between Putin and Trump in Alaska in August. “We have no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Brian Abel, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/world/jd-vance-wife-india-religion-debate-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:39:00.000Z","title":"JD Vance Expresses Hope His Hindu Wife Will Become a Christian.

JD Vance expressed hope his Hindu wife will become a Christian. That’s ruffled feathers in India \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, Matthew Rehbein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:39 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When JD Vance told a stadium of thousands he hoped his wife would one day be moved “by the Christian gospel” the same way he was, he inadvertently stepped into a contentious dialogue in India and among the diaspora about religious freedom and, for some, evoked memories of the country’s complicated past with Christian proselytizing.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at an event last month with Turning Point USA at the University of Mississippi, Vance was asked by an audience member about Christianity and American patriotism.\n \n\n   \n  “Why are we making Christianity one of the major things that you have to have in common to be one of you guys? To show that I love America just as much as you do?” the audience member asked.\n \n\n   \n  In an assertive and lengthy response that began on immigration, Vance then discussed his interfaith marriage: “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it’s fair to say she grew up in a Hindu family but not in a particularly religious family.”\n \n\n   \n  Raised in an evangelical family, Vance converted  to Catholicism in 2019.  His wife,  Usha Vance , who grew up in Southern California and is of Indian descent, was raised in a Hindu household.\n \n\n   \n  “Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,” Vance went on to say.\n \n\n   \n  As the debate around those comments began to swell online among some Indians and the Indian diaspora, Vance responded to a since-deleted comment  on X , writing that “like many people in an interfaith marriage,” he hopes his wife may see things as he does one day, but would continue to support her regardless.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on October 30 at the Turning Point USA event honoring his longtime friend and late conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, Vance explained that he and his wife were “agnostic or atheist” when they met.\n \n\n   \n  “We decided to raise our kids Christian,” the vice president said, adding that the couple’s 8-year-old son, Vivek, had his first communion a year ago –– a remark that drew thunderous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance talked about navigating raising children in an interfaith marriage during an  interview  with Meghan McCain in June, noting she and her husband had several conversations about it during his conversion to Catholicism.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not Catholic and I’m not intending to convert or anything like that,” Usha Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that while their children attend Catholic school, “they can choose whether they want to be baptized Catholic.” They are also exposed to the Hindu faith and traditions through her family, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My grandmother is a particularly devout Hindu. She prays every day. She goes to the temple regularly. She’ll do her own pujas (prayer rituals).”\n \n\n   \n  During the event last month, the vice president said, “One of the most important Christian principles is that you respect free will … You figure this stuff out as a family, and you trust in God to have a plan, and you try to follow it as best as you can.”\n \n\n   \n  But, despite Vance’s invocation of free will, his remarks struck a nerve –– some described the vice president’s words as denigrating towards Hindus –– and broadly, South Asians –– at a time of rising hostilities towards immigrants in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ridiculous and absolutely wrong,” 25-year-old Kush Mehta of Mumbai told CNN of Vance’s comments expressing his hope his wife would convert. “I’m in favor of everyone having their own identity, their own values, and their own spiritual path. No one should be forced or pressured into any religion.”\n \n\n   \n  “Vance felt compelled to declare that his wife was indeed raised Hindu, but not that Hindu,” CNN affiliate CNN-News18 editor Shubhangi Sharma wrote in an  opinion column . “In a political climate so charged against Indian immigrants, this is not just personal. It’s political. It’s a presidential call to convert.”\n \n\n   \n  “When an elected leader treats his faith as the ultimate ideal for everyone, including his wife, it ceases to be personal,” Areena Arora, a journalist with  The Hindu , wrote in an opinion piece, noting at the time of his baptism six years ago, Vance told  The American Conservative : “My views on public policy and what the optimal state should look like are pretty aligned with Catholic social teaching.”\n \n\n   \n    A reminder of India’s colonial past\n \n\n   \n  For some, Vance’s comments were a reminder of India’s painful past, where the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century heralded Christian proselytization, prejudice and, at times, forced conversions - particularly under British colonial rule.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief that the Christian religion must shape public order is the same civilisational justification that fuelled Europe’s conquest of the world,” Arora, a journalist with The Hindu, wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the differences between how Hindus and Christians think of religion, and because of the colonial history of Christian evangelizing, many Hindus today still think of Christianity as a kind of undigestible ‘foreign faith,’” said Chad Bauman, a professor of religious studies at Butler University in Indiana whose research focuses on the interactions and conflicts between Hindus and Christians.\n \n\n   \n  “This view is particularly common among the supporters of the party currently in charge,” Bauman added, referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its brand of Hindu Nationalism.\n \n\n   \n  India has seen recurring ethnic and religious clashes for centuries – but tensions have surged in recent decades amid a rise in violence against the Christian and Muslim minorities and, most notably, since the BJP came to power in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  India’s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, although some critics argue that religious freedoms have been eroded under the BJP at the expense of non-Hindu minorities. The issue of changing religion remains deeply controversial, and multiple states have put in place laws restricting religious conversions for all faiths.\n \n\n   \n  Bauman said Vance’s remarks also confirmed a common stereotype many Hindus have of religion in Trump’s America: “America is not a nation of religious tolerance and pluralism but rather one that privileges Christianity over all other religions.”\n \n\n   \n  Several social media users described Vance’s comments as contrary to American values.\n \n\n   \n  One  X  user criticized Vance for what they viewed as him casting Usha’s Hindu faith as a “problem to be fixed,” writing: “This isn’t American values; it’s weak leadership & poor politics, bending to MAGA pressure, not defending her dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Another user wrote on  X : “When JD Vance had hit his lowest, it was his ‘Hindu’ wife and her Hindu upbringing that had helped him navigate through the tough times. Today in a position of power, her religion has become a liability. What a fall.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘She has to stick to her roots’\n \n\n   \n  For some in India, Usha Vance’s position in the administration as a woman of Hindu faith has become a point of pride.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s amazing … to see someone with Indian roots and a Hindu background in such a visible, powerful space in the US. It shows how far the community has come and how diverse leadership is becoming,” said Mehta of Mumbai.\n \n\n   \n  If the second lady does convert, “It would create a lot of backlash from people who are very staunch in their beliefs,” said Vanessa Almeida, a business owner in Goa.\n \n\n   \n  “She has to stick to her roots as much as possible,” Almeida said. “That’s what the community has been hoping for.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the vice president and second lady’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  Vance was quick to defend himself on social media against backlash, writing in the  X post  that the criticism wreaked “of anti-Christian bigotry.”\n \n\n   \n  “She is not Christian and has no plans to convert,” Vance clarified, adding that Usha Vance encouraged him to “reengage” with his faith many years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “But like many people in an interfaith marriage –– or any interfaith relationship –– I hope she may one day see things as I do,” he goes on to say. “Regardless, I’ll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she’s my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is completely in contrast to Vance’s previous comments that his wife’s Hindu upbringing and values inspired his own return to faith,” Priyanka Deo, US correspondent of Indian network NDTV, said on  Instagram , adding that his latest remarks suggest acceptance in the United States is conditional and predicated upon becoming a Christian.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, who converted to Catholicism while already married, has said his wife encouraged him to explore his faith and that his family influenced him in the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember when I started to reengage with my own faith, Usha was very supportive,” Vance said during an interview with  Fox News  in June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  During the same interview, Usha Vance said she supported her husband’s decision for a few reasons, including seeing the power of her parents’ faith. “That was one of the things that made them such good parents. That made them, really, very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Wooing the Republican base?\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s comments come ahead of the 2028 election. Trump, in August, suggested Vance was “most likely” the heir apparent to the  Make America Great Again movement  –– the furthest he’s gone in backing Vance as a future presidential candidate.\n \n\n   \n  Vance also told Fox News recently he plans to talk to Trump about potentially running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Ram Puniyani, a Mumbai-based writer and critic of Hindu fundamentalism, said he thinks Vance’s comments trample on freedom of religion –– an essential tenant of any democratic society, be it the United States or India, which is still widely regarded as the world’s largest democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that America’s civic society had much more liberal attitudes earlier, but those attitudes are getting rigid, and this is not a healthy thing for the growth of democracy worldwide,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance has not spoken out about her husband’s comments, though some have jumped quickly to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “No one has been harsher on JD Vance’s policy than I have,” wrote California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who is also Hindu,  on X.  “But his wife is an accomplished daughter of immigrants, and they have young kids. Attack on the policies. Leave his family out of it.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to others who have called Usha Vance a threat to the “MAGA base,” McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, said the second lady was a “huge asset” to the Republican party, someone who bridged party and political lines and “brought warmth” to the vice president.\n \n\n   \n  “She is among other things a modern mother and a style icon,”  McCain wrote on X . “She’s personally my favorite person in the Trump administration.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/weather/texas-flash-flood-hill-country-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Flood threat for soaked Dallas and Texas Hill Country persists overnight as storms keep firing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Significant flooding is ongoing in the Texas Hill Country due to persistent storm activity, with over 9 inches of rain falling in key counties, prompting a flash flood emergency for nearly 1,300 residents.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Significant flooding is underway in Texas Hill Country as storms crawl across the South. Parts of the region are still recovering from devastating flooding that  killed more than 130 people  this July.\n \n\n   \n  Over 9 inches of rain has fallen since Thursday morning in parts of western Hill Country, prompting a flash flood emergency – the highest level of flood alert   – for nearly 1,300 people in southeastern Concho, western McCulloch and central Menard counties Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The significant rainfall led authorities to issue precautionary evacuations at local RV parks and area campsites, county judge Brandon Corbin said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The flash flood emergency has been downgraded to a regular flood warning Thursday evening, but officials are not letting down their guard. Western Hill Country could pick up another inch or less of rain before the night is through.\n \n\n   \n  Several flash flood warnings have been issued Thursday in the region, where a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place. The rest of central and northern Texas could also see localized flooding Thursday, including Dallas-Fort Worth. And a second round of downpours could pile onto the state’s flood worries beginning Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Storms were “training” over Hill Country, or lining up and moving over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track. The storms will begin to move east away from the soaked region this evening, ending the threat of additional heavy rainfall.\n \n\n   \n  The Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms.\n \n\n   \n  Farther north, storms in Dallas-Fort Worth triggered flash flood warnings Thursday morning. Several roads were closed because of flooding in the north Dallas area, according to the National Weather Service. Between 2 to 4 inches of rain had fallen. Additional rounds of rain through the early evening could bring another 1 to 4 inches.\n \n\n   \n  Flood watches extend along much of the Interstate 35 corridor from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to Austin into early Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  After drying out Friday and Saturday, a second soaking storm is expected to arrive in Texas as the weekend comes to an end. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction Center for northern and central parts of Texas from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re in the Hill Country and other parts of Texas, keep phones charged and alerts on and avoid driving through flooded roads.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/us-navy-south-china-sea-aircraft-salvage-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:31:00-05:00","title":"US Navy Trying to Pull Crashed Aircraft from Bottom of South China Sea","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Navy is attempting to recover an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet and an MH-60 helicopter that crashed in the South China Sea during routine operations off the USS Nimitz in late October 2025.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Navy is trying to recover two aircraft from the bottom of the South China Sea that US experts say could yield sensitive information to China if Beijing were to get to them first.\n \n\n   \n  The aircraft – an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet and an MH-60 helicopter –  crashed within 30 minutes of each other  while operating off the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during routine operations in late October.\n \n\n   \n  No official cause has been given for the crashes, but US President Donald Trump suggested to reporters shortly after the incidents that contaminated fuel may be to blame. All crew members were rescued.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy confirmed to CNN on Friday that a salvage ship was operating in the South China Sea, while not revealing the specific location where the aircraft crashed or where the salvage ship is now.\n \n\n   \n  “USNS SALVOR (T-ARS 52), a Safeguard-class salvage ship operated by Military Sealift Command, is on-scene conducting operations in support of the recovery efforts,” said Cmdr. Matthew Comer, a spokesperson for the Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  The Salvor is capable of lifting objects weighing up to 300 tons off the seafloor, according to Navy documents. The maximum takeoff weight of the newest F/A-18 models on the Nimitz is about 33 tons while the MH-60 weighs around 11 tons.\n \n\n   \n  While neither the F/A-18 nor the MH-60 are the most modern of the Navy’s aircraft, experts say the wrecks could yield useful intelligence if they fall into the hands of an adversary.\n \n\n   \n  “Acquiring an air frame and surviving systems will … provide valuable insights into its technological strengths and how to defeat it tactically,” said Carl Schuster, the former head of the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that an F/A-18 has never fallen into Chinese hands, but if one did, Beijing could gather information that could help it improve People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carrier-based J-15T jets, which are not considered as advanced as the F/A-18.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the MH-60 carries anti-submarine warfare systems that are likely more advanced than China’s, Schuster said.\n \n\n   \n  “China is now prioritizing the upgrading of its anti-submarine warfare systems. So, recovering that helicopter should enjoy a high priority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot confirm whether China is making any attempt to get to the lost US aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international court ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The current US recovery effort follows  a similar mission  in 2022, when an F-35 jet, the Navy’s most-advanced fighter,  crashed while attempting to land  on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\n \n\n   \n  The F-35 was eventually pulled up from 12,400 feet (3,700 meters) of water by a Navy recovery team.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, China has fortified its territorial claims by constructing military installations on contested islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The US says China’s assertions and military buildup threaten freedom of navigation in the waterway, through which trade worth trillions of dollars passes every year.\n \n\n   \n  US forces maintain a steady presence in the region to push back on Chinese sovereignty claims and support Washington’s allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  But Schuster said Beijing has an edge on getting to wrecks in the South China Sea just based on proximity.\n \n\n   \n  “If China makes it a race, it enjoys homefield advantage, if you will, and can be expected to impede our recovery efforts” if possible, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the crashes that it could offer humanitarian assistance to the US Navy if needed.\n \n\n   \n  But a spokesperson also said that the crashes occurred during what he called “US military exercises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The US has been flexing muscles by frequently sending military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea. This is the root cause of security issues at sea and disruption to regional peace and stability,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/narrow-house-majority-congress-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-05:00","title":"Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority gets a bit more breathing room after Sherrill’s resignation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has gained a slight margin of breathing room in his already narrow majority after Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill resigned to become New Jersey governor, shifting the House balance to 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has bit more room in his narrow House majority after Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned to take office as New Jersey governor.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s resignation, two weeks after her election victory and two months before she takes office, will still leave Johnson needing the near-unanimous support of his party to advance legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats, with three seats vacant. Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote, but has a bit more room for absences in his party.\n \n\n   \n  The next vacant seat to be filled will be in a Republican-leaning district in Tennessee, where a special election is scheduled for early next month. Then, at the end of January, two Texas Democrats will meet in a runoff to fill another vacancy. The special election for Sherrill’s seat is expected to take place early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/chicago-marimar-martinez-shooting-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Federal judge dismisses charges against Chicago woman shot after being accused of ramming car at law enforcement vehicle","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Georgia Alexakis, dismissed federal charges against Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, and her co-defendant Anthony Ruiz, after they were accused of ramming into a Customs and Border Protection agent, Charles Exum, in Chicago on October 4, 2025.

judge dismisses charges against Chicago woman shot after being accused of ramming car at law enforcement vehicle \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, Bill Kirkos, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:29 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Thursday dismissed federal charges against a woman shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago after allegedly  ramming into his car .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came hours after prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charges in a striking reversal by the US government, court documents show.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz – who was driving a different vehicle – had entered not guilty pleas to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.\n \n\n   \n  The unprecedented move marks the latest development in a high-profile case that garnered public scrutiny and left a federal judge skeptical of how the investigation was handled.\n \n\n   \n  After the hearing Thursday, Ruiz was seen outside the courtroom hugging a crying loved one as a smiling Martinez told reporters, “I’m just blessed. I’m happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been hard,” she said. “I can’t sleep, but now I’m gonna go sleep.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been accused of closely pursuing Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4. But Martinez’s defense attorney, Christopher Parente, alleged the opposite, saying it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Parente said, “This case was going to be a winner at trial regardless.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents were lying about what happened,” he added following the dismissal. “Miss Martinez never rammed anybody. These agents hit Miss Martinez. These agents jumped out and shot Miss Martinez, a US citizen whose only crime was warning her fellow community members that ICE was in the neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors had alleged Martinez and Ruiz “aggressively and erratically” followed and then rammed into Exum and other agents inside his vehicle who were on security detail in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Joseph Fitzpatrick, spokesperson and assistant US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said in a statement Thursday his office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz, the largest ever law enforcement surge in the Northern District of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “This continuous review process applies to all matters — whether charged or under investigation,” Fitzpatrick said. “It helps ensure that the interests of justice are served in each and every case, and that those cases that are charged are appropriately adjudicated through our federal court system.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After the collision last month, Exum stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez, according to the charging complaint. Martinez suffered five gunshot wounds, Parente previously told CNN.

This week alone, lawmakers had already weighed three different complaints in just as many days.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the wave of complaints this week, Reps. Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat, and Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, have sponsored a bill to raise the threshold for a censure to 60% of the House – rather than the current simple majority.\n \n\n   \n  “I just think we’ve got out of control,” Bacon said Thursday. “It should be more bipartisan when we do one.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed openness to reforming the process, saying it “needs to be brought under control” and that he is “open-minded” about raising the threshold.\n \n\n   \n  The minority leader, however, squarely blamed Republicans, describing their censure efforts as “extreme.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, retiring Democratic  Rep. Chuy García  of Illinois was censured for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year. It was fellow Democrat, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who forced the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García, infuriating members of her party.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  The same day, a vote to censure Democratic  Del. Stacey Plaskett , for texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, failed on a 209-214 vote. Three Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure and three Republicans registering as “present.”\n \n\n   \n  If the vote to censure Plaskett had passed, Democrats had planned to bring up a resolution against Florida GOP  Rep. Cory Mills , who has faced a swirl of controversies in his time in Congress, including an  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her.\n \n\n   \n  But on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina brought a complaint against Mills, pointing to individuals who served with Mills in the Army disputing his version of events that led him to be recommended for the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS . The complaint was referred to the House Ethics Committee after a vote to censure him failed despite seven Republicans joining Mace in favor of the measure.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/lawsuit-diddy-assault-jonathan-hay","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00.000-05:00","title":"Jonathan Hay's Allegations Against Sean 'Diddy' Combs at Center of New LA Sheriff Investigation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Hay, a music producer and publicist, alleges that Sean 'Diddy' Combs sexually assaulted him in 2020 and 2021, including incidents involving masturbation and forced oral sex, during a photoshoot and a music tribute project related to The Notorious B.I.G.

Now, his claims are at the center of a new investigation involving Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:07 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In March 2023 – eight months before Cassie Ventura filed the bombshell lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs that would ignite his  public downfall  and ultimately lead to  his criminal conviction  – another accuser was contemplating coming forward.\n \n\n   \n  Music producer and publicist Jonathan Hay had contacted a civil attorney in the spring of 2023 to discuss his claims of being sexually battered by Combs.  After speaking with the attorney’s office, Hay got cold feet, fearful of standing up against a figure as powerful as Combs. He was, he said, “terrified.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed email correspondence showing Hay reached out to the civil attorney’s office in March 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, I can’t do this,” Hay said of his first attempt to come forward with his claims against Combs in early 2023. “I’m just not ready.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay finally filed his claims against Combs – then as a “John Doe” – in July 2025, shortly after Combs was convicted by a New York jury on two federal prostitution-related counts that would lead to him being sentenced to more than four years.\n \n\n   \n  Once Ventura filed her lawsuit and dozens of other civil accusers came forward with lawsuits, he felt encouraged to tell his story. Hay said that he’d never considered that there could have been others who had allegedly been abused by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs denies all accusations against him.  Roughly 70 accusers  have brought civil lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  “Once Cassie’s lawsuit came out,” Hay said, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go. And then once the raids happened, I was like holy crap. That’s when I was like, ‘Okay, now is my time. Finally, I just decided that, alright, I’m going to go forward with this.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted someone to listen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Hay’s claims are at the center of a new investigation, launched this week by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed that their Special Victims Bureau is investigating Hay’s claims after receiving a copy of his police report, first documented in September 2025 by police in Largo, Florida, where Hay resides.\n \n\n   \n  In the police report, Hay says he suffered from sexual battery by Combs in 2020, and then again in 2021, when he was working on a remix of Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace’s music as a tribute project, honoring one of Combs’ closest collaborators. Hay worked on the new music with the rapper’s son, CJ Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2020 incident, Hay said he was working at a photoshoot when he found himself in the same room as Combs, who began to masturbate into one of Biggie’s shirts. The police report details that Combs “removed the shirt to uncover his penis and told Hay to come finish him off.” The report states that Hay told police he was in shock and “stated that Combs then finished himself off and ejaculated on one of Notorious B.I.G. shirts” and then threw the shirt on Hay, “simultaneously saying, ‘Rest in peace BIG.’”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Hay told police that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on him, which he said made him feel suicidal.\n \n\n   \n  Hay said that a detective from the LASD’s Special Victims Bureau contacted him on Tuesday this week to notify him that she had been assigned to his case.\n \n\n   \n  Hay is cooperating with authorities, hopeful that their active investigation may lead to further criminal charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggie was like his supposedly his best friend,” he said. “To just do that in a shirt and to attack me like he had?” Hay said. “He doesn’t need to be out on the streets.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality’\n \n\n   \n  Hay’s allegations first became public this July when he filed his lawsuit anonymously against both Combs and Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace is named as a defendant with Hay claiming that he and others “conspired” with Combs to “allow or assist in Combs’ ability to carry out” his actions against Hay.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace has filed a defamation suit against Hay. In it, he claims that Hay falsified these accusations because he was “irate” that Biggie’s estate decided not to release the majority of the songs produced back in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “Jonathan Hay’s allegations against CJ Wallace will be shown to be a complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality,” Jeremiah Reynolds, an attorney for Wallace, told CNN. “We look forward to Hay eventually being held liable in court for defamation.”\n \n\n   \n  “CJ knows what happened,” Hay said. “He was there. He lived it.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs also denies Hay’s claims, as he has done with the dozens of accusers who have sued him.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, a lawyer for Combs issued a blanket denial statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As Mr. Combs’ legal team has repeatedly stated for over a year now, he cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a media circus. Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,” Jonathan Davis, a civil attorney for Combs, said in a statement. “He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided – and not in the media – based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay said he is not surprised that Combs continues to deny his allegations, and he remains focused on pursuing justice through his case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that when he gets out of jail,” Hay said, “that he is taken straight to jail in California, or to go through the court proceedings in California, and that he spends the rest of his life in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  After a two-month federal trial in New York earlier this year, Combs is currently serving his four-plus year sentence at Fort Dix federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to respect the jurors and the decision that they made,” Hay said of the conviction, which Combs is currently appealing. “At least he got some time. And hopefully we can add more.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason Kravarik contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/philippines-alice-guo-jailed-scams-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Philippines Jails Former Mayor - Who Officials Say Faked Her Nationality to Get the Job - for Human Trafficking","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Philippine court has sentenced former mayor Alice Guo, who officials believe is a Chinese national named Guo Huaping, to life in prison for human trafficking and running an illegal online scam operation in Bamban, Tarlac province.

faked her nationality to get the job – for human trafficking \n       \n  Story by the Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:59 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Philippine court on Thursday convicted a  former mayor , who officials say is a Chinese national, of human trafficking charges for helping establish an illegal online gaming complex in a northern province where hundreds of Chinese and other foreign nationals were forced to conduct scams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pasig city regional trial court in metropolitan Manila sentenced Alice Guo to life in prison with seven other Filipino and Chinese co-accused, and ordered them to pay a fine of 2 million pesos ($34,000) each and compensate several trafficking victims, who filed the complaints.\n \n\n   \n  Guo denied all allegations against her and says she is a Filipino citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Vast online scam centers have  flourished  in Southeast Asia in recent years, especially in the border areas of  Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar . The UN has estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in virtual slavery by gangs who force them to financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, scam operations rapidly built vast compounds with buildings or rented upscale offices in Manila’s financial districts and moved around large numbers of workers by bribing authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine authorities allege that Guo is a Chinese national named Guo Huaping, who faked Filipino citizenship to run for mayor of the town of Bamban in northern Tarlac province, where she ran a sprawling illegal scam compound near the town hall.\n \n\n   \n  “They used the parcels of land and buildings to house the trafficked workers and to force them to work as scammers,” the court said in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a ban on hundreds of mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, which proliferated under the administration of previous President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos accused the gaming operations of crimes including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnapping and murder.\n \n\n   \n  Many have been raided and shut down since then, with tens of thousands of trafficked workers rescued and sent back to their home countries. But more scam centers remain in operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “The conviction of Alice Guo, also known as Guo Hua Ping, is a victory against corruption, human trafficking, cybercrime and many other transnational crimes,” said Sen. Risa Hontiveros. “But it is far from over.”\n \n\n   \n  Hontiveros led televised Senate inquiries last year that exposed underground online scam operations in the Philippines, along with Guo’s alleged criminal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine security officials and Hontiveros have said the scam centers operated by Guo and other Chinese nationals may have also been used for espionage by China, which has had increasingly fierce territorial conflicts with the Philippines in the South China Sea and has strongly opposed the presence of American forces in the country. The Philippines is the oldest US treaty ally in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to demand accountability from every government agency that failed in their duties, and we will continue to investigate the full extent of Chinese intelligence operations in our country,” Hontiveros said. “And to all others who enabled Alice Guo’s criminal empire: the Philippines is not a playground for exploitation, infiltration and espionage.”\n \n\n   \n  Guo has not been charged with espionage and she denies any connection to spying.\n \n\n   \n  The town of Bamban is located several kilometers (miles) from a Philippine air force base, where American forces have been allowed to maintain a rotating presence with their aircraft and weapons under a 2014 defense pact.\n \n\n   \n  Guo was dismissed from her post as mayor last year by a state Ombudsman, who cited grave misconduct. She fled the Philippines in July 2024, but was tracked down in  Indonesia , where she was arrested and deported to the Philippines. She has been in detention since last year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-recission-tally","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-05:00","title":"NCAA Currently Falling Short to Rescind Rule That Would Allow College Athletes to Gamble on Professional Sports, Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA is facing a critical deadline to rescind a proposed rule allowing college athletes, coaches, and staff to gamble on professional sports.

professional sports, the  NCAA  has a wide gap to close, a source tells  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday night, 188 Division I schools had submitted the paperwork to request the recission, the source said. The magic number to stop the rule switch is 241 – or two-thirds of the 361 Division I member institutions. If that threshold isn’t met, college athletes, coaches and staff will be permitted to gamble on professional sports by Saturday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed switch comes at a time when sports gambling is under heightened scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  In the last month,  federal authorities  have arrested two  Major League Baseball  players (Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz), as well as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones – all accused of taking part in separate gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In addition,  six college basketball players  have been deemed permanently ineligible for participating in game fixing activities, and Congress has called on sports leaders to ensure the integrity of sports.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the NCAA held steady, prohibiting its athletes, staff and coaches from betting on any sport in which it crowned a champion. Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not. But citing the growth in legal sports betting nationwide – now permissible in 38 states – and arguing that sports betting was now available to regular college students, the NCAA agreed to change its policy. Betting on college sports would still be against the rules.\n \n\n   \n  The rule change originally was meant to go into effect on November 1 – a week after the sweeping indictments involving the NBA and members of New York crime families. While the optics weren’t good, the actual implementation of the rule was delayed because of a technicality – less than 75% of the cabinet members voted in favor of the change, triggering an automatic rescission period.\n \n\n   \n  That rescission period ends Friday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/justice-department-adam-schiff-ed-martin-bill-pulte-christine-bish","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:52:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department Investigating Handling of Adam Schiff Mortgage Fraud Probe Led by Ed Martin and Bill Pulte","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department is investigating whether individuals impersonated federal agents during mortgage fraud probes targeting prominent Democrats, including Sen.

 \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether people impersonated federal agents in mortgage fraud probes of prominent Democrats, a development that could complicate efforts to prosecute political enemies of President Donald Trump, people briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The new probe led by the Maryland US Attorney’s Office and the Federal Housing Finance Agency inspector general is examining the handling of the mortgage fraud investigations into California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  One witness in the Schiff matter, a Republican from California named Christine Bish, said she traveled to Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday morning in response to a grand jury subpoena. Bish said she spoke to federal investigators inside the courthouse who asked her about people who told her they were working with Trump administration officials leading the mortgage probes.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re investigating each other,” Bish later told CNN in a telephone interview. “It’s stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  The subpoena Bish received demanded she give to the prosecutors in Maryland any communications she had with “any person or persons claiming to be” working under the Federal Housing Finance Director  Bill Pulte , the Justice Department official  Ed Martin , or others “claiming to be acting at the direction or request” of them or their offices, according to the subpoena reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte helped to prompt the Schiff and James investigations, as well as mortgage fraud-related inquiries into other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte in particular has played an extraordinary role in the probes by publicly making criminal referrals to the Justice Department, a step normally taken through mortgage investigators in his agency. And Martin has touted his pursuit of Trump’s political foes.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors are also looking into whether grand jury materials gathered in the James case were illegally shared with people who were not authorized to review it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. James has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department declined to comment. The FHFA, its inspector general’s office and Martin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Pulte also were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  Bish, who previously ran for office in California, has publicly said she had information to share about Schiff related to his mortgages. She told CNN on Thursday that when she came to the Greenbelt courthouse, she believed she was going to provide grand jury testimony on Schiff and mortgage fraud, but that prosecutors “seemed more concerned” about looking into whether “there was conspiracy or collusion between me and Pulte or me and Ed Martin.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she passed her independent findings on Schiff to Pulte’s office earlier this year, after she said his office contacted her directly.\n \n\n   \n  Schiff is one of Trump’s longtime political foes, with the president in September pushing in a Truth Social post for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute him.\n \n\n   \n  “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action,”  Trump wrote in the post . “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office have been hesitant to proceed with charges against Schiff, CNN previously reported. Schiff has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crime, and his attorney declined to comment for this story Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re trying to tie me into some kind of clandestine conspiracy, it’s not there, and the best way to protect myself is to be open and honest and public,” Bish said Thursday, adding later: “Something’s not adding up. And I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but I will.”\n \n\n   \n  The interview questions Bish was asked on Thursday went beyond any probe into Schiff, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “They assured me, when they interviewed me, that the focus of the investigation was Adam Schiff. And I kept pulling the testimony back to Schiff, but it seemed like they were looking for more — stuff that doesn’t exist,” Bish said at the courthouse on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators focused their questions on two people whom Bish said reached out to her for information on Schiff.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people worked in the first Trump administration and claimed to work for Pulte, and Bish said she spoke to the person several times. The other person said he was affiliated with the mortgage agency Freddie Mac, according to Bish, and she said she spoke to him once.\n \n\n   \n  “You know – had I ever talked to Director Pulte? Had I ever talked to Ed Martin? Did I have any communication with them? And that’s where the conversation kept going back,” she added. “So I don’t know if they’re on a fishing expedition or you know what’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she has never spoken with Martin.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Evan Perez and Kara Scannell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/style/frida-kahlo-portrait-record-woman-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:54:00-05:00","title":"Frida Kahlo Self-Portrait Sells for $54.7 Million, Setting New Record for Female Artists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo’s self-portrait 'El sueño (La cama)' has sold for $54.7 million at Sotheby’s in New York, setting a new record as the most valuable artwork by a female artist ever sold at auction.

It’s now been overtaken by Kahlo’s more recent sale, and drops down to second place  –  and third for the most valuable artwork by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the auction, the painting, which had not been seen publicly for almost three decades, was shown in London, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Paris and New York.\n \n\n   \n  It sees Kahlo lying on a bed that floats against the backdrop of a pale blue sky. Curling green vines envelop her body, while a skeleton wired with dynamite and holding a bouquet of dried flowers lies above her.\n \n\n   \n  The bed was a regular motif in Kahlo’s work. She was confined to her bed for long periods of time as she endured a life of chronic pain following a near-fatal bus accident and subsequent surgeries.\n \n\n   \n  During the long recovery after the accident, Kahlo’s family set up an adapted easel and fitted a mirror to the canopy of the bed so she could continue to paint while lying flat. “I am not dead and I have a reason to live. That reason is painting,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo painted the piece in 1940, which was a turbulent time for the Mexican artist. It was the year that she remarried Diego Rivera after divorcing the fellow artist a year earlier, and was also the year that her former lover, the Russian revolutionary Leon Trosky, was assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  In an email to CNN prior to the auction, Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby’s head of Latin American art, said “El sueño (La cama)” had been “one of very few works of this calibre still in private hands.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frida Kahlo occupies a completely singular place in art history. There’s an almost spiritual connection people have with her paintings, which are so deeply personal yet at the same time resonate universally. We’ve seen it this season while El sueño (La cama) has been on display around the world, with lines out the door,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “This painting has all the hallmarks of a signature Frida: the self-portrait, a surrealist imagery, and most importantly, a psychological intensity and that sense of communion between artist and viewer.”\n \n\n   \n  The painting formed part of the private collection auction “Exquisite Corpus.” It featured more than 80 surrealist paintings, drawings and sculptures, including pieces by René Magritte and Salvador Dali.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-mack-rhoades-resigns-from-baylor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Baylor AD Mack Rhoades Resigns, a Week After Taking Leave for Personal Reasons","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mack Rhoades, who served as Baylor University’s athletic director since July 2016 and was chairman of the College Football Playoff selection committee, resigned on November 20, 2025, a week after taking a personal leave of absence.

case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Michel, 52, declined to address the court before US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said “betrayed his country for money” and “lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.”\n \n\n   \n  “His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,”  they wrote .\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client’s 14-year sentence is “completely disproportionate to the offense.” Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an “absurdly high” punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel’s attorneys said in a court filing.\n \n\n   \n  “The Government’s position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,”  they wrote .\n \n\n   \n  Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the US from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.\n \n\n   \n  Michel obtained over $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho – also known as Jho Low – and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Michel also tried to end a Justice Department investigation of Low, tampered with two witnesses and perjured himself at trial, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “Low’s motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,” Michel’s attorneys wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel’s request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney’s  use of a generative AI program  during his closing of the trial’s arguments.

The real reason behind China’s fury toward Japan’s Takaichi \n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:36 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks into the job,  Japan ’s new leader has come face-to-face with what it means to cross  China ’s red line on Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since  Sanae Takaichi  suggested her country could respond militarily if China were to move to take control of Taiwan by force, Beijing has pulled out its economic pressure playbook: warning its citizens against travel and study there, suggesting there’ll be no market in China for Japan’s seafood exports, and unleashing a wave of wall-to-wall nationalist fervor pointed at the prime minister.\n \n\n   \n   The furor  appears carefully calibrated to send a warning to Japan – and other countries in the region – of what could happen if they even consider taking a stance at odds with China on Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  But the spat, which shows no sign of abating roughly two weeks on, also reveals something else: Beijing’s deep-seated concerns about the potential for changing military postures in Asia – as US allies ramp up defense spending and coordination in the face of its own  rising military might .\n \n\n   \n  No other country piques those concerns like Japan, whose Imperial Army in the 20th century invaded, occupied and waged atrocities on China and, decades earlier, colonized Taiwan – key pain points in China’s so-called “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers.\n \n\n   \n  Anti-Japanese sentiment has simmered in the country since that time – flaring up and gaining traction in recent years with nationalist hardliners’ voices becoming increasingly mainstream in China under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\n \n\n   \n  Reinforcing the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding determination to ensure history can never repeat itself, Xi has rapidly modernized China’s military and grown its global influence.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in Beijing’s eyes, Takaichi’s comments reveal that Japan does not respect the vast rebalancing of power that’s positioned China as an ascendant superpower – and that it has military ambitions that could threaten China’s rise.\n \n\n   \n  “For the first time, a Japanese leader has expressed ambitions for armed intervention in Taiwan and issued a military threat against China,” a commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily  said  earlier this week. “Behind this lies the dangerous attempt by Japan’s right-wing forces to break free from the constraints of the pacifist constitution and seek the status of a ‘military power.’”\n \n\n   \n    Japan’s ‘militarism’\n \n\n   \n  Japan has made a  sweeping shift  in its security posture in recent years, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, to boost its defense budget and acquire counterstrike capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  That’s come as Beijing has ramped up its military activities in the region, including around Taiwan – and as the US has pushed its allies for more burden-sharing on defense spending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response, but politicians – particularly among right wingers in Takaichi’s party – are increasingly wary of the implications for Tokyo if Beijing attacks Taiwan, which sits strategically to Japan’s south. This sentiment has resulted in a growing impetus to further expand Japan’s defense spending and even change the constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Now Takaichi, a hawkish figure who has previously drawn Beijing’s ire for questioning some of the narratives around imperial Japan’s culpability for its war atrocities, has taken the step of speaking plainly on the Taiwan issue. In the first days of her term, she also called for closer security ties with the US and is moving to accelerate the country’s defense build-up.\n \n\n   \n  In Beijing’s eyes,  according to  a social media account linked to the Chinese military, such efforts run the risk of seeing “the ‘ghost’ of militarism” reemerge “to wreak havoc in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  And that’s why some on the Japanese side feel that Beijing is lashing out now “to box Takaichi in and put her on the back foot early on – so she will be more reluctant to push forward on Japan’s investment in defense,” according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed civilians during its occupation, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre, one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century. Japan has repeatedly apologized and expressed remorse for its wartime atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  That era, however, has been front and center in China this year as Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II, when Japan’s surrender to Allied Forces freed China from its occupation and saw Taiwan handed over to the Nationalist-run Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China in 1949 after emerging victorious from a civil war, while the defeated Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. Beijing has used the anniversary to justify its claim to the island – and broadcast concern about what it sees as Japan’s turn toward militarism.\n \n\n   \n  China sees taking control of Taiwan as a core piece of the “national rejuvenation” that it must complete by mid-century – a goal that, if Beijing decides must be achieved by force, could be heavily complicated by a stronger Japan.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, Takaichi’s comments can be summed up as “the wrong person, talking about the wrong thing” at the “wrong time,” according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Defending its sovereignty’\n \n\n   \n  Despite Tokyo dispatching an envoy to Beijing earlier this week to calm the dispute, Beijing has showed no signs of dialing back its deluge of rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  It’s instead insisting Tokyo retracts the comment – a position that offers neither side an easy way to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, China has continued to stoke nationalist feelings, including sabre-rattling from China’s military, which on Wednesday released a video titled “Don’t be too cocky.” Without mentioning Japan by name, it includes a rap crooning: “We’ve honed our skills through rigorous training, how can we allow you to be so cocky?”\n \n\n   \n  But it may be an image of Japan’s foreign ministry envoy Masaaki Kanai and his Chinese counterpart Liu Jinsong following their meeting in Beijing earlier this week that underscores why China won’t want to ease up pressure just yet.\n \n\n   \n  That image – showing Liu standing straight with his hands in his pockets, talking to Kanai who tilts his head forward while listening – has gone viral across Chinese social media.\n \n\n   \n  Commentators have referred to the Japanese diplomat as “bowing,” while they hailed the choice of Liu’s attire – a suit whose style is associated with China’s May Fourth anti-Imperialism movement of 1919.\n \n\n   \n  The symbolism, it appears, was no coincidence: “China’s stance in defending its sovereignty remains unchanged for a century,” said a caption on a post from state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-cowboys-ceedee-lamb-missed-curfew-explanation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00-05:00","title":"CeeDee Lamb Says Casino Visit Led to Curfew Violation with Fellow Cowboys Receiver George Pickens","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, Dallas Cowboys wide receivers, were benched for the first series of their 33-16 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders due to a curfew violation at the Red Rock Casino the night before the game.

\n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, Taylor Romine, Chris Boyette, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:45 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The dayslong immigration crackdown that arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week appeared to end with the same level of confusion it began with, as local officials announced the operation concluded Thursday while federal officials refuted those claims.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Thursday, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden issued a statement saying the federal immigration enforcement operation in the city had ended. But moments later, a top Department of Homeland Security official rejected that characterization.\n \n\n   \n  DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.\n \n\n   \n  At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to  what happened in Chicago  after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his agents are  expected to launch an operation in New Orleans  after the Thanksgiving holiday ,  as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said  in a post  following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion\n \n\n   \n  In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city,  fear and confusion  swept through the Charlotte community.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.\n \n\n   \n  One  nonprofit  estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have  closed at some point  during the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history,  closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen .\n \n\n   \n  While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings,  warned the community  not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.\n \n\n   \n  “CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare\n \n\n   \n  While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Charlotte’s community  adopted tactics  they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte,  some  also  stood outside the entrance  of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the  Broadview ICE facility  near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Both cities  quickly mobilized  to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.\n \n\n   \n  The operation also  took Charlotte by surprise , as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials  hadn’t shared details  about the operation or its timing, Trump  frequently named Chicago  as a  target  for a federal crime crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The focus now appears to be shifting to New Orleans, a city President Trump considered sending the National Guard to  as early as September . New Orleans would be one of the first Democratic-led cities in a Republican-led state targeted for an immigration enforcement operation. CNN has reached out to local and state officials to see how they are preparing for the potential operation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/settlers-set-fire-to-cars-in-latest-west-bank-arson-as-israeli-pm-convenes-meeting-about-settler-violence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00Z","title":"Israeli settlers torch scrapyard in West Bank arson attack as Netanyahu calls meeting on rising extremist violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli settlers torched over 150 vehicles at a scrapyard in Huwara, a Palestinian town in the West Bank, in a major arson attack that occurred on November 20, 2025.

Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli settlers set fire to cars in the latest arson in the occupied West Bank as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a security meeting on settler violence.\n \n\n   \n  According to witnesses and WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, settlers torched a vehicle scrapyard in the town of Huwara in the northern West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military said its soldiers were dispatched to Huwara after receiving reports of Israeli civilians throwing rocks toward Palestinian vehicles, setting fire and damaging property.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows numerous cars on fire as firefighters try to extinguish the blaze. Thick, black smoke pours into the night sky from the fire that appears to spread over a sizable area.\n \n\n   \n  Mohammed Dalal, who owns the scrapyard, says more than a dozen settlers descended on the site, smashing cars and starting the fire. He says no one was in the scrapyard at the time, but he estimated that 150 cars were torched or damaged.\n \n\n   \n  “I have children in university, I have grandchildren, I have a family; we all depend on this scrapyard,” Dalal told CNN. “Like many Palestinians, I have olive trees, but I haven’t been able to harvest my olives and so this is our only source of income. All I can do is ask God to compensate us.”\n \n\n   \n  The attack happened the same evening Netanyahu convened a security meeting on settler violence in the West Bank, according to two Israeli officials, which has surged in recent weeks and months. It’s unclear if any decision was reached on how to respond to the escalating attacks. On Monday in a rare condemnation of settler violence, Netanyahu said the attacks were being carried out by “a small, extremist group.”\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Defense Minister Israel Katz declared that Israel will no longer use administrative detention against Israeli settlers, preventing the country’s security apparatus from using one of its most powerful tools to incarcerate settlers while still employing it widely against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledge that cars had been set on fire in the Palestinian town, not far from the settlement of Yitzhar, which is known for its extremist ideology. The IDF said there were no injuries following the incident and soldiers conducting searches did not find any suspects.\n \n\n   \n  This latest attack is the second major arson in a matter of days after dozens of settlers set fire to Palestinian homes and vehicles to the south of Bethlehem. Last week, settlers launched a  major arson attack  on an agricultural area in the northern West Bank, setting fire to trucks, metal sheds and more.\n \n\n   \n  Huwara has come under settler attack before. In June 2023,  settlers rampaged through the town , killing one Palestinian man and wounding hundreds of others in what the former IDF military chief later called a “pogrom.” The large-scale attack was billed as “revenge” after a Palestinian gunman killed two brothers who lived nearby.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/hang-democrats-trump-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-05:00","title":"Why Democrats Are Warning About Trump Giving Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of congressional Democrats released a video urging military members not to follow unlawful orders from President Donald Trump, sparking a sharp political response from Trump, who claimed the action constituted sedition and even suggested that those individuals might deserve to die. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that Trump does not support executions, but argued that the video threatens the chain of command. However, the Democrats’ video explicitly referenced only unlawful orders, and military law (specifically Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice) allows soldiers to disobey orders that are manifestly unlawful. Critics, including Fox News figures and Republican lawmakers, accuse Democrats of fabricating a straw man by inventing specific illegal orders from Trump. The controversy is further fueled by Trump’s recent military strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific, which have killed over 80 people without legal process or public justification — actions criticized by the United Nations, the United Kingdom, and Republican lawmakers like Rand Paul, and supported by a classified Justice Department legal opinion.

And yet again, he’s basing this argument on a rather novel legal theory and a dubious interpretation of the facts.\n \n\n   \n  A half-dozen congressional Democrats cut a video this week urging members of the military  not to obey unlawful orders  that Trump might issue. Trump then responded by issuing a series of social media posts suggesting these members had committed sedition and possibly even deserved to die.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from saying they should be arrested, to re-posting someone who said George Washington would “HANG THEM,” to saying “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Thursday that Trump  does not, in fact, want members of Congress put to death .\n \n\n   \n  But she otherwise stood by the idea that these members were acting dangerously and undermining the commander in chief. She said the members were urging members of the military to “defy the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are literally saying to 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers to defy the chain of command – not to follow lawful orders,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  But that is not what they were literally saying.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the members were not urging anyone to disobey “lawful orders.” They explicitly referred in the video only to  unlawful  orders – and repeatedly so.\n \n\n   \n  The other problem is that “defying the chain of command” isn’t just something military servicemembers are  allowed  to do in such cases; it’s something they’re often  required  to do.\n \n\n   \n  The section of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice dealing with failing to obey orders states that members can only be sanctioned for disobeying lawful orders. And servicemembers are generally obligated to not follow orders that are “manifestly unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  If there’s a potentially more legitimate objection to Democrats’ video, it’s that they’re erecting a straw man – basically that they’re inventing out of whole cloth the prospect of Trump issuing illegal orders, in order to make military servicemembers hesitant to abide his orders.\n \n\n   \n  This is the argument that some of Trump’s allies have gone for on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum in a separate segment pressed Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, one of the lawmakers in the video, repeatedly on the same subject.\n \n\n   \n  “What specific order from the commander in chief that we are asking our military to carry out are you objecting to?” MacCallum said. “This is very, very vague.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not as if this is a prospect Democrats have invented out of whole cloth. Trump has given them plenty to work with, including some things  Crow mentioned in the interview .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly proposed doing things – with the military and otherwise – that appear to be illegal. People who served with him have said he suggested illegal action. And Trump is certainly testing the bounds of the law with his use of the military even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  The big example right now is Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean – strikes that have  killed more than 80 people  without a legal process.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that both the United Nations and top allies like the United Kingdom regard the strikes  as illegal extrajudicial killings . Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has echoed those claims, while other GOP senators have questioned their legality as well. The administration has also declined to publicly detail its legal justification, even as the Justice Department has produced a  classified legal opinion  authorizing the strikes. It has released survivors of the strikes who, if they had been kept in US custody, could have  forced it to defend itself in court . Also, a top commander who CNN has reported  raised questions about the legality of the strikes  is now retiring early.\n \n\n   \n  There is a very real question about whether the servicemembers involved in those strikes are carrying out illegal orders. And the administration has proactively avoided a more robust legal process that could settle that question.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s hardly all. Here are some other key data points:\n \n\n   \n  It’s certainly provocative for Democrats to raise this issue like they have. But it’s not as if they’ve conjured it out of thin air.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/polar-vortex-cold-snowy-december-stratosphere","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:17:00Z","title":"Polar Vortex Disruption on the Way: A November Event of Unprecedented Magnitude","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden stratospheric warming event in the upper atmosphere above the North Pole is weakening the polar vortex, a phenomenon almost unheard of in November.

\nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  High above the North Pole, in a slice of atmosphere  rarely noticed and even less understood , a transformation is underway. Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat, and it could begin the week of Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:44:00Z","title":"CDC Website Changed to Include False Claims Linking Autism and Vaccines","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The CDC website was recently updated to include false and scientifically unsound claims suggesting a potential link between vaccines and autism, despite overwhelming evidence showing no such connection.

This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Paul Offit agrees. In a  post on Substack  on Thursday, Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said scientific studies can “never prove never.”\n \n\n   \n  “If RFK Jr. wanted to be honest with the American public, he would make it clear on the CDC’s website that chicken nuggets also might cause autism, which has never been and will never be disproven,” Offit wrote.\n \n\n   \n  HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC’s website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on an episode of his  “Chasing Life” podcast  that he doesn’t think vaccines cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s no medicine that’s 1,000% safe,” Makary said. “And I think we have to remember that with everything. I think the absolutism around some of this stuff creates mistrust. And when we say they’re 1,000% safe and it’s impossible for there to be a single complication of a vaccine, that’s the kind of rhetoric, I think, that doesn’t resonate well. So I think we have be humble and take a very honest approach.”\n \n\n   \n    Studies find no relationship\n \n\n   \n  Other bullets on the updated CDC page say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This too is not true: Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proved to be poorly done or were fraudulent. There are, however, many well-done, credible studies that find no such relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One of the  largest studies  looking at this question was published in 2019. Researchers in Denmark enrolled more than 650,000 children born between 1999 and 2011 and followed them from the time they were 1 year of age until the end of August 2013. Roughly 6,500 children were diagnosed with autism during the study period.\n \n\n   \n  When the researchers compared those who received the MMR vaccine with those who did not, they found no significant difference in the risk of developing autism. That held true whether the kids got other vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine; whether they had siblings with autism; or a host of other factors, such as whether certain kids might be prone to developing a form of regressive autism after getting their shots.\n \n\n   \n  “This study strongly supports that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk for autism,” the authors wrote in the conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  This study is not cited on the CDC’s updated “state of the evidence” on MMR vaccines, however. Instead, it mentions older evidence reviews and raises questions about aluminum, an ingredient added to some vaccines to boost their protection.\n \n\n   \n  The new CDC updates do mention another recent Danish study, published in 2025, which found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of 50 disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. But instead of accepting the overall conclusion of the study, the new CDC page tries to cast doubt on it by homing in on details of data in a supplementary table, saying the findings and other “warrant further investigation” into aluminum exposure and chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC page also says the US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\n \n\n   \n  Singer said this is a waste of valuable research money and a distraction from strong science showing that most cases of autism can be traced to genes that affect a baby’s brain development.\n \n\n   \n  The main heading  on the page  states that “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but it has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”\n \n\n   \n  The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana,  during his confirmation process  that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy told CNN on Thursday that he had spoken with Kennedy.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on X on Thursday, Cassidy said, “I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Dangerous health disinformation’\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Peter Hotez, who is director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and wrote a book called “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism” about his daughter’s diagnosis, said the updated information on the CDC’s page follows a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve decided they want to prove vaccines cause autism. So they keep making a series of assertions,” Hotez said, going back to debunked research that claimed the MMR vaccines caused autism and a retracted 2005 Rolling Stone article by Kennedy that asserted the preservative thimerosal caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  There have also been claims that aluminum in vaccines was a cause of autism, and those have been disproved, Hotez said.\n \n\n   \n  Hotez says the updates to the CDC’s page are “pure garbage.”\n \n\n   \n  “I consider it a piece of dangerous health disinformation, and it needs to be removed right away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on social media late Wednesday that the changes are “a national embarrassment.”\n \n\n   \n  “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Daskalakis said the agency’s scientists were completely blindsided by the page update.\n \n\n   \n  “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than restoring trust in America’s health agencies, moves like this have undermined it, said Dr. Sean O’ Leary, a pediatrician who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear that it’s going to lead to fewer children being vaccinated, children suffering from diseases they didn’t need to suffer from,” O’Leary said.\n \n\n   \n  This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter longstanding US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has hired longtime anti-vax allies – including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was  once disciplined  by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office – to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.\n \n\n   \n  The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. In a call with state health officials Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the US status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-democrats-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00Z","title":"Trump Accuses Democratic Lawmakers of Seditious Behavior, Punishable by Death","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump accused six Democratic lawmakers—Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio, and Chrissy Houlahan—of committing 'seditious behavior, punishable by death' for urging military and intelligence personnel to refuse illegal orders.

lawmakers who urged military to disobey illegal orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’ \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Thursday suggested that Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials  to disobey illegal orders  should be put to death, sparking an outcry among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the president was seeking to incite violence.\n \n\n   \n  “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, responding to a video from half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military and intelligence community urging people currently in those roles to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote. He also reposted several other users’ posts, including one that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n \n\n   \n  The comments drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who condemned Trump’s comments as an attempt to incite violence, and even drew the scrutiny of members in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally who served as a lawyer for the military reserves, said the president’s remarks were “over the top,” though he also said he considered the Democrats’ video “despicable.” And GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he didn’t think it was “really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later denied that Trump was calling for lawmakers to be executed, arguing that the members of Congress with national security backgrounds should not be encouraging anyone to defy orders from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These members knew what they were doing. They were leaning into their credentials, as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander in chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him and you can betray your oath of office,” Leavitt said. “That is a very, very dangerous message. And it perhaps is punishable by law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers in the video – Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan – vowed they “will not be intimidated.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the lawmakers said in part.\n \n\n   \n  “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.”\n \n\n   \n  Slotkin was accompanied by USCP officers to an event in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Her team requested the additional presence from USCP for the event that took place off Capitol Hill, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n   “I think when a lion’s share of Americans understand that it is in their own power to push back on this kind of rhetoric and this kind of threat, that’s when we actually turn the tide,” she said at the event.\n \n\n   \n  Deluzio called for both parties to unite against what he called Trump’s “outrageous call for political violence.” “It’s a moment where Democrats and Republicans and everyone else in the country should condemn his calls for political violence,” he said on CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Crow, meanwhile, warned on CNN that Trump’s comments should be taken seriously. “We have to take everything that Donald Trump says seriously. He throws a lot of stuff out there, but some of the things he carries through on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the comments “an outright threat” and that Trump was “calling for the execution of elected officials.” He added from the Senate floor: “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team said they had been in touch with law enforcement authorities to make sure lawmakers were protected.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families. Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the president’s comments, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he didn’t agree with them but dismissed the video that sparked his reaction as “unnecessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t agree with that. Obviously, everyone has their First Amendment rights. But what they did was ill-advised and provocative and unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, similarly called the video “wildly inappropriate,” as he defended Trump. Though he later conceded he wouldn’t have used the same language.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to allow others to make legal judgments about how that…the words that the President chose are not the ones that I would use, OK,” Johnson said Thursday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, I don’t think that this is…these are crimes punishable by death or any of that,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The lawmakers who posted the video that sparked Trump’s reaction did not specify which orders service members received, or might receive, that could be illegal. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said in the video, adding, “Know that we have your back. … Don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at those lawmakers’ actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat Party.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/north-korea-operatives-fake-job-portal-ai-firms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"North Korean operatives running fake job portal targeting US AI firms","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korean operatives have launched a sophisticated cyber campaign using a fake job application platform that mimics the popular headhunting platform Lever.

fake job portal targeting US AI firms \n       \n  By Sean Lyngaas, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:18 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  North Korean operatives created a fake job-application platform targeting applicants to major US artificial intelligence and crypto firms as part of a new effort to steal money and know-how for the Kim Jong Un regime,  researchers said  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a twist on a yearslong campaign to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies: Instead of simply impersonating employees of those companies,  North Korean  tech workers are now working to gain long-term access to the computers of applicants before they join a company, according to security firm Validin, which discovered the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  “Going after job seekers gives North Korean actors a huge advantage. Instead of trying to slip past an employer’s defenses, they take over the entire hiring process and make it feel completely legitimate to individuals,” Validin’s chief executive Kenneth Kinion told CNN. “People assume they’re doing a normal coding test or following steps for a promising job opportunity, so they’re far more likely to run whatever the interviewer sends them.”\n \n\n   \n  The fake jobs platform mimics the style and substance of Lever, a headhunting platform that boasts tens of thousands of customers. Among the fictional jobs advertised on the North Korean-built platform are a “product manager” related to Claude, the popular AI model developed by San Francisco-based firm Anthropic.\n \n\n   \n  Anthropic’s technology is in high demand. The firm committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft’s compute capacity to expand the use of Claude, Microsoft announced this week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from Lever, Anthropic and all the other companies impersonated in the scheme. The North Korean diplomatic mission in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Because many candidates don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking elsewhere, they’re less likely to report anything suspicious, making it even easier for the attackers to slip through unnoticed,” Kinion said.\n \n\n   \n  Kinion, whose team discovered the fake job portal this week, said he wasn’t aware of anyone who has fallen victim to the scheme yet, but many have fallen for past industrial espionage campaigns tied to Pyongyang.\n \n\n   \n  For years, North Korean workers have used fraudulent identities and sometimes passed interview screenings to infiltrate American companies big and small. The workers then send the money back to Pyongyang to support the regime’s rogue weapons program, according to private experts and US officials.\n \n\n   \n  A previous CNN  investigation  showed how the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korean hackers have also  stolen billions of dollars  from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. A White House official  estimated  in 2023 that half of  North Korea’s  missile program had been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.\n \n\n   \n  A series of US indictments and sanctions has raised awareness of the insider IT worker threat. Pyongyang has evolved its tactics in response, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “These operators appear to hold elevated privileges, far beyond what a standard IT worker receives, which is evident from their more malicious activities,” Michael Barnhart, a North Korea-focused researcher at insider threat firm DTEX Systems, told CNN. “This reinforces the notion that these activities are part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem within North Korea’s cyber operations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/nigeria-christians-trump-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00Z","title":"Nigerian Officials Meet U.S. Officials Amid Trump’s Threats of Military Action Over Christian Violence in Nigeria","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigerian officials, led by National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, are engaging in high-level diplomatic talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in Washington, amid President Donald Trump’s public threats of U.S. military action in Nigeria over violence against Christians.

Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau this week amid increasing focus from the Trump administration on Christians in Nigeria and as President Donald Trump has floated potential US military action in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said  earlier this month  he would be designating Nigeria as a country of particular concern over conditions for Christians, saying Christianity is “facing an existential threat” and threatening US military action as a result.\n \n\n   \n  Experts and analysts have cautioned that the situation is  far more nuanced , as both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria have come under attack by Islamic extremists. The Nigerian government has rejected claims it is not doing enough to protect Christians, and Nigerian presidential spokesperson told CNN the government was “shocked” that Trump was “mulling an invasion of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Nigerian National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu is leading the delegation in Washington this week, which is also meeting with members of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  A Pentagon official confirmed Hegseth was meeting with Ribadu on Thursday. Landau will meet with the delegation on Friday, a State Department spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly Hegseth’s meeting will focus on, though sources told CNN there has been a willingness from Nigeria to work with the US military more closely. Hegseth also spoke with the head of US Africa Command, Gen. Dagvin Anderson, on Wednesday, a US official said, though it was also unclear if that conversation was directly related to Hegseth’s meeting on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A senior State Department official described the Nigerian delegation as “very high level.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re committed to having those frank conversations with Nigerian officials,” the official said, noting that labeling Nigeria as a country of particular concern has “gotten the Nigerian officials’ attention.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken with his counterparts in Nigeria, the senior State Department official said, and there are also plans for trips to Nigeria.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re happy to partner with them. We’re not saying good luck. We’re saying, we want to help you make your country safer for religious communities of all stripes, not just Christians, not just Muslims, whoever it may be,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  And while Nigeria has long had a military-level relationship with the US, some sources indicated Trump’s social media post saying he would send the US “guns-a-blazing” into the West African nation to protect Christians has brought about new urgency to the relationship.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a willingness to work with the US from the Nigerians,” a source familiar with the situation told CNN, “and US Africa Command will clearly and happily work as a partner with whatever African nation is willing to work with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  As the visit to Washington has been underway by the Nigerian officials this week, Mike Waltz, US ambassador to the United Nations, and rapper Nicki Minaj spoke about the “deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria,” during  a UN event Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  And on Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Africa Subcommittee held a hearing on Nigeria with State Department officials regarding the labeling of Nigeria as a country of particular concern.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615169","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:38:00-05:00","title":"Trump and Mamdani Share a Cordial White House Meeting After Months of Trading Attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following months of political attacks, President Donald Trump and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a cordial and productive meeting at the White House, marking a notable shift from hostility to cooperation.

The White House sit-down on Friday marked a stark contrast for the two leaders. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, as too extreme for the city that he long called home. In the president's announcement of the meeting on Truth Social earlier this week, Trump called Mamdani a \"communist.\" However, speaking to reporters after  the meeting in the Oval Office , that antipathy was nowhere to be found. Trump praised Mamdani's campaign and pledged to work with him on shared policy concerns centered on the cost of living and reducing crime. \"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see – really wants to see – New York be great again,\" said Trump, who was born in Queens, N.Y., the same borough that Mamdani partially represented in the State Assembly. \"I'll be cheering for him.\" Mamdani had previously called Trump a \"despot,\" but standing to his side on Friday he echoed the president's interest in cooperating around shared goals. \"I enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to working together to deliver that affordability for New Yorkers,\" he said. Over the course of just months, Mamdani's candidacy for mayor turned from a long-shot bid to a national movement, sparking interest  far beyond New York  in his progressive ideas, including freezing rent in rent-stabilized units, making city buses free and opening city-run grocery stores. It's a platform that quickly caught the ire of many conservative leaders, notably Trump, who made no secret of his opposition to Mamdani following his  upset win  in June's Democratic primary. In the lead-up to Election Day, Trump said he would arrest Mamdani if he disrupted ICE operations in the city, and falsely suggested that Mamdani — a naturalized citizen — was living in the country illegally. At one point, he threatened to pull the city's federal funding were Mamdani to win. He also endorsed Mamdani's rival in the race, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But over the course of his public appearance with Mamdani, Trump told reporters he was surprised by several broad areas of agreement.  \"He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down, all things that I agree with,\" Trump said, while acknowledging that the two leaders \"may disagree how we get there.\" While it's unclear if the meeting will lead to a lasting working relationship, Friday's meeting seemed to signal at least a temporary break from the past rhetoric that defined their relationship.  Trump rose to Mamdani's defense on multiple occasions while speaking to reporters, declining to agree with  conservative attacks  calling Mamdani a \"jihadist,\" and saying he would feel comfortable living in New York City under a Mamdani administration. \"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,\" Trump explained. \"I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job.\" The president also made light of Mamdani's past comments, where he referred to the president as a \"fascist.\" When reporters asked Mamdani to confirm, Trump interrupted and brushed off the label, telling the incoming mayor, \"That's okay. You can just say yes.\" \"It's easier than explaining it,\" Trump added. \"I don't mind.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Just weeks after being elected the next mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani is meeting President Trump at the White House. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The 34-year-old democratic socialist quickly became a national figure after an upset primary win earlier this year. He's got a lot of fans, particularly among young voters and progressives. But he's also become a foe for many on the right, including President Trump. MARTÍNEZ: NPR political reporter Elena Moore will be covering that meeting. Elena, this is one of these meetings where I did not expect these two in the same room together. ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Yeah, I mean, it's actually a tradition for the incoming mayor-elect to sit down with the president. Also, New York is an important place. It's the biggest city in the country and President Trump's hometown. He's from Queens, the same borough that Zohran Mamdani represents in the State Assembly right now. But despite that connection, A, Trump has been a vocal critic of Mamdani. Ahead of election day, he went as far as to endorse Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York who was running against Mamdani. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, and they seem like political polar opposites. So I can kind of see why Trump would be riled up by the new mayor. MOORE: Well, yeah. Mamdani ran on the Democratic ticket, but he identifies as a democratic socialist. And he's made some ambitious campaign promises aimed at tackling the rising cost of living, like freezing the rent for rent-stabilized apartments and creating city-run grocery stores. But his ideas are also ones that conservatives have painted as radical and extreme, and Trump has really taken that up a notch. He's repeatedly called Mamdani a communist. He said he'd arrest him if he didn't cooperate with ICE raids as mayor and suggested that Mamdani isn't living in the country legally even though, A, he's a naturalized citizen. MARTÍNEZ: And what's been Mamdani's response to Trump? MOORE: He's largely stood his ground. I mean, Mamdani made a point even to address the president directly in his victory speech, looking into the camera and telling Trump to turn the volume up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZOHRAN MAMDANI: Hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us. (CHEERING) MOORE: Part of what makes Mamdani so impactful right now is that he's built a large movement, one that a lot of longtime Democrats just don't have at the moment. In the lead-up to election day, I talked to voters around the country who said they've been feeling increasingly disappointed by the Democratic Party in recent years but see Mamdani as a welcome change. So he is popular. And that's why, you know, partly, Trump is paying attention. MARTÍNEZ: So what are they going to talk about? New York Knicks basketball? MOORE: (Laughter) I wish. I mean, speaking to reporters yesterday, Mamdani said that even though he disagrees with Trump a lot, he's willing to work with anyone who wants to make life more affordable for New Yorkers. And as a reminder, I mean, Trump vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won. So there are real stakes here. But this isn't just about the dollars. You know, this meeting is a reminder of the big shift that Mamdani has to make in these next few weeks as he takes on this job. He's got a background as an activist, but being mayor of New York City is a totally different role. So today, it may be a test for him, you know, on balancing the policy priorities that got him elected and maintaining the political diplomacy required as mayor. MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Thanks a lot. MOORE: Thank you.

Gringlas \n        \n           Saturday, November 22, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene became a household name in the run up to the 2020 election   for divisive rhetoric, political stunts and enthusiastic support of President Trump. But after growing disagreements with Trump during his second term, Greene announced she will leave Congress in January before her term is up. Greene said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\" Greene's split with Trump widened in recent weeks as she pushed for the release of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. For months, Greene had been publicly pressing Trump and top Republicans in Congress to release all files from two federal investigations into Epstein. She was part of a small cadre of Republicans who helped force a vote on the House floor to release the files — a process that drove Trump to reverse his position on the documents and led to near-unanimous support for the measure this week. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But before Trump reversed course, he lashed out last week, calling her \"Marjorie Traitor Greene,\" and told reporters, \"Something happened to her over the last period of a month or two where she changed politically.\" In her post Friday night, Greene defended her decision to fight for the release of those documents.  \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote. Greene's defiant push against Trump On a brisk morning this week, Greene stood outside the Capitol with some of the women who say they were abused by Epstein. \"I've never owed him anything,\" Greene of the president on Tuesday. \"But I fought for him and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.\" The cracks between Trump and Greene grew over the last year, as Greene increasingly pointed out where she saw the president falling short:  she called the war in Gaza a genocide ,  criticized Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities , and pressed for expiring health subsidies to be extended, citing the threat of skyrocketing premiums for people in her district,  including her own children . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And she was doing it not just on social media or right-wing outlets, but on programs like  ABC's  The View . \"What Happened to Marjorie?\" \"I was thinking, if this was the first time I'd ever seen this person, it sounds like a normal congressperson from Schoolhouse Rock,\" said University of North Georgia professor Nathan Price after Greene's appearance on the daytime television staple. For some, this new persona may be hard to square with the Greene many Americans first got to know: the congresswoman who embraced QAnon conspiracy theories, liked a post that called for violence against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. and heckled school shooting survivor David Hogg in 2020, before he became a prominent political activist. Even Trump has publicly mused in recent weeks: \"What happened to Marjorie?\" Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson says it's a fair question. \"I am open to the idea that she's had a 'road to Damascus' moment, a conversion, that she sees the errors of the toxicity and wants something that's better,\" Robinson said in an interview with NPR earlier in the week. On her own social media and with journalists, Greene has been open about addressing claims from Trump and others that she has changed or abandoned the president. NPR reached out to Greene for further comment. \"Nothing has changed about me,\" Greene told the hosts of  The View . \"I'm staying absolutely 100% true to the people who voted for me, and true to my district.\" Robinson said the changes could be part of a natural evolution for Greene, a former CrossFit gym owner from the Atlanta suburbs. \"We love to elect outsiders to Congress,\" Robinson said. \"They go to Congress with very little idea of how it works. And if at some point you're like, 'I want to do substantive things that make America better, then I've got to do this a little bit different.\" Or, Robinson said, she may be trying to broaden her appeal with an important constituency as she weighs a bid for higher office. Trump said last week he showed Greene polling earlier this year suggesting she would flounder in a race for Georgia governor or Senate. \"Is she intentionally signaling to women, 'The good old boys club ignores us, and I understand your struggles?\" Robinson said. Both Robinson and Price said Greene's evolution was more about style than substance. She has disavowed some of her more controversial views, but not others, like the unproven assertion that widespread fraud upended the 2020 election result. The anti-interventionist, anti-elite principles that first propelled her to Congress also remain core to her identity. \"What she's responding to is believing that the President has shifted on these issues,\" said Price. Some potential political opponents see an opportunity in Greene's break with Trump. Robinson, who worked for Greene's opponent in her first primary race, says in the past he has warned potential challengers not to underestimate her. \"You are wasting your time,\" Robinson said. \"She will beat you. And I would have said that into infinity until this week.\" How Greene's district reacted to the shift But in the 14th Congressional District, it was not clear this week that anything had changed. As chair of the Paulding County Republican Party, Ricky Hess spends a lot of time talking with voters. \"The issues that they want to talk about involve high property taxes, high health care costs, whether or not their kids will be able to buy a house when they graduate,\" Hess said this week ahead of Greene's resignation .   Hess told NPR he believes   Greene's \"America First\" worldview resonates in this heavily working class and rural stretch of Northwest Georgia. \"She's pretty tapped into what her constituents are wanting, and I have to believe that most of her actions are in service to that,\" Hess said. Hess said voters saw Trump and Greene as fighters on the same team. Though Martha Zoller, who hosts a political talk radio show that airs across North Georgia, said in an interview Wednesday she didn't believe everyone's minds were made up. \"People are kind of reeling, if you want to know the truth,\" Zoller said. \"We haven't had a lot of listeners discussing it because they're waiting to see what happens.\" Georgia political observers noted that Greene has been anything but a predictable politician — including her surprise resignation.  Trump has  come to a truce with other politicians  he's feuded with, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. And his future relationship with Greene could still evolve. But Zoller said the conflict between Trump and Greene has been about more than just two big personalities falling out on the national stage. \"I think that the big discussion we're going to be having as Republicans over the next few years is what is the Republican movement once it's not Trump?\" Zoller said earlier this week it seemed clear that Greene wants to be part of that discussion. But with her resignation, the answer to that question is may be less clear  now than before.

Here's why \n         By Elissa Nadworny  \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 4:51 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item:  College Tuition How has the price changed?  Over the last 30 years — average tuition for both public and private four year colleges  has essentially doubled  after adjusting for inflation. It really does feel like tuition is always rising. I found a  New York Times   article from 1970  noting that tuition at Harvard University for the coming year was going to jump – by $200 – from $2,400 a year to $2,600 (which would be about $21,000 today when adjusted for inflation). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Next year, the tuition at  Harvard will be  more than $59,000, though when you add in things like housing and food, that number price tag jumps to more than $86,000. But many families aren't actually paying those high sticker prices. Instead, students get financial aid or merit aid, and end up paying a lower cost, called the net price. Net price is still up when you compare with two decades ago, but  in recent years the trend is more flat . Or, in some cases, falling. Data from the College Board's annual report tracking college prices shows that tuition for in-state students at public four-year colleges peaked in 2012, and has since declined. Judith Scott-Clayton, a professor of economics and education at Columbia University's Teachers College has been writing about the difference between those $100,000 price tags and what families really pay  for more than two decades . \"College is expensive and no one is saying it's not a challenge,\" she says \"But it's also important to acknowledge that it's not a hopeless case.\" Why has the sticker price gone up so much? There are many factors behind this. At public institutions, a big factor for many years was declining state funding; as legislatures reduced that funding, colleges were forced to raise tuition to make up for it. In recent years, though, state funding has rebounded somewhat. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a huge drop in enrollment at colleges, so in some places that increase of state investment combined with fewer people going to college, meant more money per student. There's also administrative bloat at some schools. And some experts blame student loans, though  there is mixed research on this . Since 2007, the amount of student debt held by Americans has more than tripled, to roughly $1.6 trillion. As the ease of obtaining student loans increased, some researchers say, colleges absorbed that money in tuition increases. Other experts point to rising costs, and competition: There are always new fancy buildings to build, and more staff to hire. Also, having a high price tag dictates prestige. And there are wealthy families willing to pay those high prices: At Harvard — 40% of the incoming class  pays full price  — they don't get any financial help. The actual costs are often murky. Some families pay one thing, others pay another price. And no college seems to cost the same. The market is opaque, and that's another reason tuition is high: Families often don't know until the end of the admission process how much these schools will cost them. Which means,  it's very hard to price shop , comparing one school's cost to another. \"That means colleges don't really compete on price with one another because students can't see the price up front,\" says Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"They can't play different colleges' pricing offers against one another the way they could in a normal market.\" Some solutions There have been efforts – including in Congress – to standardize financial aid offer letters, to allow more comparison between colleges. Another solution the Trump administration has touted is to freeze tuition. One example of a university holding down costs by freezing tuition is Purdue University. In 2013, Purdue locked undergraduate tuition at around $9,000 a year for in-state students, and $28,000 for out-of-state. The move brought a lot of skepticism at the time, but the freeze is still in place –  more than a decade later . \"We've increased tuition revenue without raising prices,\" says Chris Ruhl, Purdue's chief financial officer and treasurer. How? \"By serving more students,\" he explains – both in-state students and out-of-state students from within the U.S. Also, \"we've grown other revenue streams,\" he adds, \"and then, we've been laser-focused on costs.\" Ruhl points out that, historically, colleges set their budgets first, then set tuition at a level that would cover all the expenses. Purdue's freeze, he says, flips that model: They start with tuition and then adjust revenue goals and spending to meet what the university can afford. There are very affordable options  One thing to note is that tuition varies widely, from college to college and from state to state. In Florida, for example, the average tuition for in-state students is about $5,000 a year and t hat's remained constant for about 10 years . And in many places, community colleges offer an affordable alternative, with the option to transfer later to a four year school. And, for low-income students, a  Federal Pell Grant  could end up making that tuition free, or nearly so. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The high cost of college has led a lot of families to question just how important it is to get a degree. Even Congress, which held a hearing on student debt this week, is alarmed. For our Cost of Living series, NPR's Elissa Nadworny joins us to talk about price tags on tuition. Good morning, Elissa. ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: Hi. OK. So it's no secret that college tuition has gone up quite a bit. But, Elissa, just how much has it ballooned? NADWORNY: OK. So over the last 30 years, average tuition for both public and private four-year colleges has essentially doubled after adjusting for inflation. And the thing is, it really does feel like tuition is always rising. I wanted to tell you about a New York Times article that I found from 1970, Leila, bemoaning the tuition at Harvard, saying that it's soaring by jumping $200. FADEL: Which would be a dream today. (LAUGHTER) NADWORNY: That journalist - yeah, exactly - would be pretty shocked that today Harvard tuition, plus room and board, is about $83,000. FADEL: OK. But that sticker price that's advertised - that's not actually what many families pay, right? NADWORNY: That's right. So most families get financial aid or merit aid, and what they actually pay is called net price. But net price has still gone up quite a bit over time because colleges have raised tuition faster than financial aid can keep up. FADEL: But why? Why have colleges raised their tuition so much and so fast? NADWORNY: Well, there's a lot of factors. For public schools, the decrease in state funding. There's administrative bloat. Some research point to student loans. Like, regardless of the tuition, students can just borrow from the federal government. And there's also rising costs and competition. There's always fancy buildings to build, you know, more staff to hire. FADEL: And often, having a high price tag dictates prestige. NADWORNY: Exactly, and there are plenty of wealthy families who are willing to pay those really high prices. I mean, at Harvard, 40% of their freshmen pay the full price. They don't get any financial help. FADEL: Some families pay one thing. Others pay another price, and no college seems to cost the same. That seems... NADWORNY: Yeah. FADEL: ...Like, yeah, a pretty murky market. NADWORNY: Exactly, and it's another reason why tuition is so high. It's not transparent. Here's Preston Cooper, who studies the economics of higher ed. He's at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. PRESTON COOPER: That means that colleges don't really compete on price with one another. Because students can't see the price up-front, they can't comparison shop. They can't play different colleges' pricing offers against one another the way they could in a normal market. FADEL: OK. Are there any solutions? NADWORNY: OK. So let me tell you about one - a tuition freeze. So Purdue University, a public land-grant school in Indiana, did this in 2013. They locked undergrad tuition. They have been doing it for 14 years. I talked to Chris Ruhl, the CFO at Purdue, about this. CHRIS RUHL: We've increased tuition revenue without raising price by serving more students. We've grown other revenue streams, and then we've been laser-focused on costs. NADWORNY: So historically, colleges set their budgets first and then divvied up the bill, setting tuition to meet that. Purdue flips that. They start with tuition, and they adjust revenue goals and spending to meet what they can afford. FADEL: So in addition to Purdue, there are other affordable options, right? NADWORNY: Yeah, of course. So places like Florida, the average tuition for in-state students is below $5,000 a year, and that's remained constant for about 10 years. There is a huge range in tuition. I mean, a lot of community colleges are charging even less for low-income students. A federal Pell Grant would end up making that tuition free for a lot of low-income students. FADEL: That's NPR's Elissa Nadworny. Thank you, Elissa. NADWORNY: You bet.

resign \n         By Stephen Fowler \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 21, 2025 • 10:08 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and recently became one of his biggest critics, is leaving Congress. In a nearly  11-minute video statement , Greene excoriated the Republican Party, House leadership and the start of campaign season \"which means all courage leaves and only safe campaign re-election mode is turned on.\" Greene's announcement late Friday that she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, is the  latest escalation  of months of clashes with the president over his second term agenda – including the release of the Epstein files. \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's campaign promise to release files related to the life and death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week – was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The third-term congresswoman also said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\" \"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife,' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\" Greene is  one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators  who have indicated they do not plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office. Her resignation will likely set up a special election to finish the rest of her term in the spring. The  fracturing of Trump's MAGA coalition  has been developing for months, with splits over foreign policy issues like bombing Iran and the support of Israel's war in Gaza accompanying questions about domestic effects of tariffs. Greene has been a vocal opponent each time.  Greene has remained ideologically consistent throughout her time in Congress and with her criticism of Trump. Her argument is that the president and the Republican Party have changed and fallen short of the Make America Great Again and America First vision. Notably, her announcement video also blasted the \"political industrial complex of both political parties\" that focuses on which side \"can convince Americans to hate the other side more.\"  \"And the results are always the same, no matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat,\" she said. \"Nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.\" Greene's retirement announcement comes at a time when the Republican Party – and Trump – are facing a number of setbacks, including defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections and poor economic headwinds. Now, there is a large and visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the party and its future, accelerating the inevitable questions around what a post-Trump GOP would look like. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is leaving Congress. The Georgia Republican rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and more recently became one of his biggest critics. Greene announced late Friday she would resign her seat, effective January 5, 2026. It is the latest development in months of clashes with the president over his second-term agenda. NPR's Stephen Fowler had been covering that rift and is here to talk about the breaking news, Hey, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. DETROW: There is an 11-minute video that Greene posted online tonight detailing her decision to leave Congress. What does she have to say? FOWLER: There's a lot in here. I mean, it's equal parts excoriation of how she says Trump has abandoned America First ideology, the dysfunction of the House and a pretty impassioned defense of her choices and time in office and the attacks that she's been on the receiving end of lately. She mentioned all the things she did for Trump and Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: With that has brought years of nonstop, neverending personal attacks - death threats, lawfare, ridiculous slander and lies about me that most people could never withstand, even for a single day. FOWLER: She also said, quote, \"I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better.\" DETROW: So there's been tension with some of the policies of this term. There's been a lot of tension and frustration with Congress, and I mean, she's not alone on that front. But is this decision all about Epstein, in the end? - the files, the fight over that. FOWLER: Well, it is, but it's also worth noting that it's because this split has been a long time coming. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been at the forefront of criticisms this year of Republicans who haven't always agreed with Trump 2.0 policy planks. On the foreign policy front, that includes the bombing of Iran in support of Israel's war in Gaza. Domestically, there's been rifts over some of the tariff policies and the subsequent walk backs the administration has done. Marjorie Taylor Greene's argument has been, she has stayed true to what Make America Great Again and America First means, and that Trump, even though he started those movements, is no longer fully in touch with the movements. Then there's the Epstein files. Trump's campaign promised to release them, and subsequent stonewalling and walking back was another example of how there was this disconnect, and that turned quite nasty and personal. Here's another thing Greene said in her video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREENE: Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for. DETROW: Stephen, this is going to be about halfway through a two-year term. What is it about Congress that has Greene leaving in the middle of it? FOWLER: Well, there's also a soundbite for that, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREENE: I do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president that we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms. FOWLER: Greene was an advocate of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy when he faced a revolt from a narrow Republican majority, then helped oust him, and she also hasn't had a great relationship with current House Speaker Mike Johnson. She's also one of many Republicans who criticized the House staying out of session during the longest ever government shutdown, and she decried the, quote, \"political industrial complex\" of both major parties that, she says, focused on convincing Americans to hate the other side more. I want to put this in a greater context, too. Greene is one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators, mostly Republicans, who say they're not planning to return to their seats after the 2026 election. DETROW: That is NPR's Stephen Fowler. Stephen, thank you for covering this breaking news for us.

Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wolfe, Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:37 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focusing on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska and closely examining the actions of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard was initially charged with a felony in an incident involving an unrelated different person, but the charge has since been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest and dismissal of false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.” Buzzard faced a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n  At a pretrial hearing  November 20 , the judge did not find sufficient probable cause and dismissed the charge and the pre-trial supervision, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The hearing featured testimony from the accuser who said he felt threatened by Buzzard when he visited her home on November 6,  KSBY reported . The judge ruled to dismiss the complaint, saying an audio rexcording of their conversation did not show enough evidence for the accuser to have been in fear, according to KSBY.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live music performances from various artists.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["music","concerts","featured","live performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615204","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:48:00-20:00","title":"'I’m Not Going to Be Intimidated': Rep.

On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline  Leavitt denied the president wanted to execute members of Congress , adding \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed.

He's one of the Democratic lawmakers that was in that video message to U.S. service members. He's also a former paratrooper and Army Ranger. Congressman, good morning and thank you for joining me. JASON CROW: Good morning. FADEL: So what was it like to see the president call you and your colleagues traitors who should face execution? CROW: Well, it wasn't a great day. I can tell you that. It's not the first time I've received death threats doing this job, unfortunately, and I'm sure it won't be the last. But I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not going to allow... FADEL: Do you consider what he said, the president, a death threat? CROW: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's no other way to take it. FADEL: I understand you've also gotten other death threats since these comments. CROW: Yeah. FADEL: Walk me through what you've been dealing with. CROW: Well, that's right. I mean, you can't have something like that come from the president of the United States and him tweet and retweet death threats from the Oval Office and not have people take that seriously. I mean, that is the environment that we're in right now. When somebody like Donald Trump says something, there are unfortunately people who will act on it. And I know this well 'cause I also lived through the insurrection on January 6. I was trapped at the House gallery while I saw Trump supporters brutally beat and try to derail our democracy. So I've seen this happen before. This is, unfortunately, the environment that Donald Trump has created for us. FADEL: Now, the White House later said the president doesn't actually want to execute members of Congress. He simply wants to hold them accountable. I want to play you a bit of what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had to say yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: To suggest and encourage that active-duty service members defy the chain of command is a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do. And they should be held accountable. And that's what the president wants to see. FADEL: Is that what you were doing in that video, asking the military to defy the chain of command? CROW: Oh, absolutely not. And they actually outright lied. Karoline Leavitt lied about what we said. What we said was U.S. law and the Constitution requires that service members only obey lawful orders, which is actually something that we are trained on from the very first days of our military career. The White House, the president, Stephen Miller and others then said the opposite of what we said and claimed that we were saying that they should disobey lawful orders, which, of course, is not at all what we did say or would ever say. So that is what they do, though. You know, they twist and contort and just lie about what people say and then weaponize it against them. And we're just never going to stop telling the truth, and we're not going to bow down from our duty. FADEL: Now, every one of you in the video have a background in military service, intelligence service. Why did you feel it was important to make this video reminding service members that they can defy illegal orders? CROW: Well, the president has made a number of very disturbing comments related to the use of the military, everything from saying he's going to go to war with Chicago to asking whether or not he could use the military to shoot peaceful protesters to suggesting that he's going to use the military at polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. So given his statements and his lawlessness in the last 11 months, we are in an environment where things like this are very possible. They're even plausible. And then you add on top of that the fact that you have to train people before an incident, right? When I deployed my troops to Iraq in 2003, I didn't wait until they had to make a split-second decision on a mission to train them about what they had to do and what their obligation is. You train them before. I spent months training my platoon on marksmanship and small unit tactics but also the law - the law of warfare, the Geneva Convention. You cannot wait until they're in that moment. And that's what we're trying to do, is start a conversation with our troops, start a conversation with America about what could happen and what people will do and what their obligation is in that moment. FADEL: So it isn't that you are seeing illegal orders being ordered right now. It's that you're anticipating that things that are out there might come to be true? CROW: Well, I personally, and as a member of Congress, have deep concerns about a lot of the activity that the administration is undertaking. But what I'm talking about here and we were aiming at the video is... FADEL: Yeah.

South Africa hosts G20 as tensions with U.S. flare amid boycott \n         By Kate Bartlett \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 1:48 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The world's   biggest economy will be conspicuously absent from a meeting of the globe's 20 richest nations this weekend, as the U.S. boycotts the G20 Leaders' Summit hosted by South Africa. The Trump administration is snubbing the event over false race-based claims and what it considers the summit's DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion -- agenda. Since returning to office Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners. \"You know we have a G20 meeting in South Africa, South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what happened there is bad,\" Trump said earlier this month. The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration, to no avail. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ramaphosa has kept his cool and was taciturn this week, saying: \"Their absence is their loss.\" Still, it's a huge blow to South Africa on the global stage. President Javier Milei of Argentina announced he isn't coming in solidarity with Trump. The leader of the world's second biggest economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is also not attending – though not as a slight – he isn't travelling internationally much these days. Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin who can't come as he'd face arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine. William Gumede, an associate professor at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, says the summit controversy is a sign of the times. \"It is symbolic of the fractured global moment that we are in… it's almost an alternative summit without China and without America,\" Gumede told NPR. The summit's themes of \"solidarity, equality, sustainability\" are anathema to the U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying South Africa is pushing a quote \"DEI and climate change\" agenda. However other countries whose leaders  are  attending, like Germany, have praised the theme. U.S. Spat deepens As foreign leaders like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer started to arrive in South Africa on Friday, the  U.S.-South Africa spat deepened after Ramaphosa said the U.S. had made an eleventh-hour request to send a delegation after all. \"We have received notice from the United States…about a change of mind about participating in one shape, form or another in the Summit,\" he said. \"We still need to engage with them fully on what their participation at the 11th hour means.\" However, the South African leader said \"the United States being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be there, so it is pleasing there is a change of approach.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back angrily. \"The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa, I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States and that language is not appreciated,\" she said. She said because the U.S. is taking over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa, the embassy's chargé d'affaires—seen as a junior official -- would be there for the symbolic hand over. However Ramaphosa's spokesman said on X, quote \"The president won't hand over to a chargé.\" One of the big questions is whether the end of the summit on Sunday will result in a joint declaration by the countries in attendance – which the  U.S. is unlikely to sign. Tensions at home Aside from the geopolitical wrangling over the event, there has been discontent surrounding the summit from many in South Africa. Johannesburg residents have complained the city is only getting a cleanup for foreign guests despite having had crumbling infrastructure and chronic electricity and water shortages for years. \"Oh they are fixing, the traffic lights are up…the grass has been cut, all for? G20... You're showing off for visitors but you have no regard for the people that live in that city,\" journalist Redi Tlhabi said in her popular podcast. Ahead of the summit, on Friday, thousands of women dressed in black marked a day of action against gender-based violence, staying home from work and peacefully protesting by laying flat in parks and at university campuses. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group organizing the event, Women for Change, say they wanted to call attention to the high rates of femicide and violence in South Africa as the G20 convenes. Then there's been the war of the billboards. Trump's reason for snubbing South Africa has put race relations here in the spotlight and Afrikaners have differed in their responses. One right-wing Afrikaans rights group, which agrees with Trump that whites are being persecuted, has put up large billboards welcoming G20 delegates to \"the most race-regulated country in the world\" – a reference to affirmative action laws. In response, a progressive Afrikaner association has mounted their own campaign, with billboards showing the country's beloved rugby team, the Springboks. In the photo, two smiling white Afrikaner players carry their Black captain Siya Kolisi on their shoulders. \"Terrible things are happening in South Africa,\" reads the tongue-in-cheek tagline on the billboard. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   The world's biggest economy will be conspicuously absent from a meeting of the globe's 20 richest nations this weekend, as the US boycotts the G20 leader summit hosted by South Africa.

BARTLETT: Since returning to office, Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaner farmers. Both claims are false. The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration to no avail. Ramaphosa was taciturn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAMAPHOSA: And their absence is their loss.

In a dramatic and unexpected twist in the final stage of a long and divisive criminal trial, federal agents entered Bolsonaro's house early Saturday under the order of a Supreme Court Justice to take the former president to the headquarters of the country's federal police in the capital, Brasilia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case on Bolsonaro's attempt to keep the presidency after his defeat to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022, ordered the preemptive arrest after saying the far-right leader's ankle monitor was violated at 12:08 a.m. on Saturday. His lawyers claimed in a statement that did not take place. Bolsonaro, 70, who had been under house arrest, was ordered to wear the device after being deemed a flight risk. His aide Andriely Cirino confirmed to The Associated Press that the arrest took place around 6 a.m. on Saturday. A protest organized by Bolsonaro's son alerted the justice De Moraes said the arrest was a preventive measure to avoid a potential escape during a protest organized by his son later Saturday. \"Are you going to fight for your country or are you going to watch it all from your cellphone in your home's sofa?,\" Flávio Bolsonaro said in a video inviting people to go outside his fathers' house at 7 p.m. \"I invite you to fight with us.\" De Moraes said the attempt to break the ankle monitor was a confirmation Bolsonaro would try to escape during \"the confusion that would be caused by a demonstration organized by his son.\" The judge said there was a chance of Bolsonaro fleeing to the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia. The Supreme Court justice also mentioned other defendants in the coup case and political allies of the former president leaving Brazil to avoid jail. \"He is located about 13 kilometers (8 miles) away from where the United States of America embassy lies, in a distance that can be covered in a 15-minute drive,\" said de Moraes, who has been sanctioned by the Trump administration. In August, Brazil's federal police found messages that linked Bolsonaro to a political asylum request to Argentina, where an ally of his, Javier Milei, is president. Bolsonaro's lawyers said in a statement that the former president's arrest \"causes deep perplexity because, as (de Moraes') chronology of facts shows, it is based in a vigil for prayer,\" not a protest. The preemptive arrest of Bolsonaro, who is an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, will be discussed and voted on Monday by the five-justice Supreme Court panel that both convicted and sentenced him to prison by 4 votes to 1 in September. \"Pathetic illegal initiatives\" Local media reported that Bolsonaro, who was Brazil's president from 2019 to 2022 and remains a key political player, was expected to begin serving his sentence sometime next week after all appeals of his conviction are exhausted. Few protesters were outside the federal police headquarters in Brasilia as of Saturday morning, with more expected later as organizers of the vigil mentioned by Bolsonaro's lawyers say they will move it to where the former president is jailed. Detractors of the former president were celebrating online and scheduling parties later in the day in major Brazilian cities. \"The video shot by Flávio Bolsonaro stimulates the disrespect to the constitutional text, to the judicial decision and to (democratic) institutions, showing there's no limits for the criminal organization in its attempt to create chaos and conflict in this country, in a total disrespect to democracy,\" de Moraes wrote in his ruling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democracy following his 2022 election defeat. Prosecutors said the coup plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. Bolsonaro was also found guilty on charges of leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. He denies any wrongdoing. Bolsonaro's allies vow to defend him Fabio Wajngarten, Bolsonaro's former press adviser and lawyer, said the arrest of the former president was \"a terrible stain on the institutions.\" Speaking in a video posted on X, Wajngarten added: \"It's a shame. I hope this is reviewed soon.\" He claimed Bolsonaro's ankle monitoring device was working perfectly as of Saturday morning. \"How could something that was broken, violated, be functioning normally nine hours later?\" he wrote. \"The president had dinner — a soup — yesterday with four brothers and brothers-in-law, took medication for hiccups, felt drowsy and laid down around 10 p.m. None of his sons were at the house.\" Sóstenes Cavalcante, Bolsonaro's party whip in the lower house, accused de Moraes of showing \"psychopathy at the highest level.\" \"We will always stand by your side. Stay strong,\" he said in a video shared with the AP. \"We will respond appropriately.\" In an Instagram post, Michelle Bolsonaro, the former first lady, vowed Bolsonaro's supporters \"will not give up on our nation.\" She was outside Brasilia when her husband was arrested at home. Lula is in South Africa for a summit of the G20 group of industrialized and emerging-market nations. Gleisi Hoffmann, one of his top ministers, said on her social media channels that Bolsonaro's arrest comes after \"violent attempts of coersion\" of Supreme Court justices by the former president. \"Martyr and impactful popular leader\" Bolsonaro was placed under house arrest in early August, weeks before he was convicted. His lawyers were pleading with Brazil's Supreme Court to keep him at home to serve his sentence, citing his poor health, but Brazilian law requires that all convicts start their sentences in prison. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Creomar de Souza, a political analyst with Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said the move by de Moraes will impact next year's presidential election, with Lula seeking reelection and Bolsonaro already barred from running. \"They had the idea of turning the 2026 election into a referendum on Bolsonaro. And for that to happen they needed actions, they needed to build an optics of Bolsonaro as a martyr and an impactful popular leader,\" de Souza told the AP. \"At the end of the day, this shows the Bolsonaro family they will need to build their own alternative for the 2026 elections.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615207","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00-04:00","title":"U.N. climate talks end without agreement on phasing out fossil fuels","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil ended without a formal agreement on phasing out fossil fuels, despite pressure from over 80 countries, including developing nations and major economies like Germany, the UK, and Mexico.

end without agreement on phasing out fossil fuels \n         By Michael Copley, Julia Simon, Rebecca Hersher \n        \n           Saturday, November 22, 2025 • 3:59 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's United Nations global climate conference in Brazil ended on Saturday with a formal agreement that failed to address phasing out fossil fuels — the main driver of global warming. The United States was conspicuously absent from this year's talks, known as COP30, after the Trump administration  refused  to send a delegation to Belém, Brazil. In the end, the conference delivered only modest progress on international efforts to curb global warming and pay for the costs of adapting to a hotter planet. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Earlier in the week, more than 80 countries had demanded negotiators agree to a \"roadmap\" to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels. The group included many developing nations hit hard by climate change, along with the United Kingdom, Germany, and oil producers like Mexico and Brazil.  They said world leaders need to start drawing up concrete plans to deliver on  a landmark 2023 commitment  to reduce the use of oil, coal and natural gas. However, major fossil-fuel producers including Russia and Saudi Arabia have  opposed  the creation of a process or timetable to move away from those energy resources. In the end, the formal agreement did not include any mention of fossil fuels.  The president of this year's summit, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago of Brazil, acknowledged that many countries had wanted a more ambitious agreement. Two dozen countries have said they'll work alongside the U.N. in a new process focused on  transitioning away from fossil fuels.  In April, Colombia and the Netherlands  plan to host  the first international conference focused on the issue. Ralph Regenvanu is climate change minister of Vanuatu, an island nation facing rising sea levels. He says the new conference is the key accomplishment to emerge in Belém. \"The text is not great, but at least we have an outcome,\" Regenvanu says. Here are the important take-aways from COP30. No roadmap for fossil-fuel transition The burning of fossil fuels remains the biggest driver of global warming. However, climate negotiators have struggled for years to agree on how countries should address the world's reliance on those resources. Two years ago in Dubai , countries for the first time called for a global transition away from fossil fuels. This year, dozens of countries had wanted world leaders to start coming up with plans to do just that. But in the end, there was no such deal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The final agreement in Brazil says countries understand the \"need for urgent action\" to make \"deep, rapid and sustained\" cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, without any specific mention of fossil fuels. Many countries were disappointed. \"There is no [climate change] mitigation if we cannot discuss transitioning away from fossil fuels,\" said Daniela Durán González, head of international affairs for the Colombian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. Setting a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels won't be easy. The global economy still largely runs on oil, coal and natural gas, though countries are adding huge amounts of renewable energy to their electric grids. A transition away from fossil fuels should not be imposed on countries, especially developing nations, Nigeria's delegate told the conference.  Nigeria will not support climate plans \"that will lead to our sudden economic contraction and heightened social instability,\" the delegate said. The planet will pass a critical temperature limit in the 2030s COP30 came as a crucial temperature target slipped out of reach. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations agreed to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to temperatures in the late 1800s. Scientists have found that risks to people and ecosystems  accelerate  with every tenth of a degree beyond that limit.  But a  recent United Nations report  concluded that the planet will likely exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the next decade. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It is still possible to limit that overshoot, however. If countries can cut overall greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035, scientists say the planet would quickly return to lower levels of warming. The world is not currently on track to meet that goal. Under current policies, global emissions are expected to fall by  just 12% by 2035 . That's not nearly enough to avoid catastrophic warming, according to science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \"The science says we need five times that much,\" says Alden Meyer, a senior associate at E3G, a climate change think tank. \"We need a 60% reduction if we have any chance of staying close to the 1.5 Celsius temperature goal.\" Little progress on funding climate action With the world facing worsening impacts from climate change, attention has increasingly focused on ways to help nations adapt. That means money. The challenge is especially urgent in poorer countries, which typically suffer some of the worst impacts from disasters, yet bear little responsibility for the pollution that's raising global temperatures. At last year's climate summit in Azerbaijan, wealthy countries  agreed to a deal  to provide developing nations with at least $300 billion a year in financing by 2035. That's triple what poorer countries were promised under  a previous commitment . The deal struck in Azerbaijan also included a broader target to boost overall climate financing for developing countries — including from the private sector — to $1.3 trillion annually within a decade. But wealthy countries have been unreliable funders in the past. Developed nations were late meeting a prior funding commitment. And funds set up to compensate countries for climate-related damages are still mostly empty, according to U.N. Secretary General António Guterres. Meanwhile, developing nations face growing losses from extreme weather events. Weeks ago, for example,  Hurricane Melissa  hit Jamaica as a category 5 storm, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage – equal to nearly a third of the country's gross domestic product, according to Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's minister of economic growth and job creation. The negotiations in Brazil did little clarify how additional funding will be provided. The final agreement \"calls for efforts\" to triple within a decade the amount of financing available to help nations adapt to a hotter world, like better flood defenses and infrastructure that's built for more extreme weather. The deal also says countries agreed to \"urgently advance actions\" to boost climate financing for developing countries. China spotlighted trade issues With the U.S. absent from this year's talks, attention turned to China, which is both the largest current source of climate pollution, and the global leader in manufacturing green technology like solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles. China has elevated discussions of trade at the conference, says Li Shuo, director of the China hub at the nonprofit Asia Society. \"They happen to be the country that produces the lion's share of green and low-carbon products. And they have become now a champion of free trade in this particular regard,\" he says. \"They want the rest of the world to purchase their products.\" A new conference for phasing out fossil fuels One of the key events at the conference was the announcement of a new conference dedicated to the global phase-out of fossil fuels. The conference will be held in Colombia, a fossil fuel producer , and co-hosted by the Netherlands - the birthplace of oil giant Shell. Colombia's Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres told NPR that the new conference held in Santa Marta, Colombia, will be complementary to the U.N. climate process. \"The idea of the Santa Marta conference is to have this first space in which we are completely clear that the phasing out [of fossil fuels] is necessary,\" Torres says. Meyer says he isn't surprised that this new conference has emerged. \" I think it reflects the frustration of both countries and NGOs who have seen very little action in this [United Nations] process,\" Meyer says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615262","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00-04:00","title":"These fans have sung their way to the National Women's Soccer League finals","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the National Women's Soccer League finals begin in San Jose, fans of the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC are bringing more than jerseys—they are bringing a dynamic and emotionally rich culture of singing and chanting.

finals  kick off on Saturday in San Jose, Calif., fans of the  Washington Spirit  and  Gotham FC  are bringing more than jerseys and banners. They're bringing an entire culture of singing and chanting that has become central to the league's game-day experience. For supporters of the Washington D.C. team, that energy has been building all season. The  Spirit Squadron , one of the club's major fan groups, has spent months preparing the repertoire they'll unleash from the stands on Saturday. \"We have a chant just for when we score,\" said Squadron president Meredith Bartley, of a raucous, snare drum-laced chant celebrating getting the ball into the back of the net. It's set to the nursery song \"The Animals Went in Two by Two.\" There's a chant (with the endearing refrain \"You're my favorite soccer team!\") for when fans are simply having a blast. And there's one rooted in local politics. \"This season, we've started in the 51st minute a 'Free D.C.' chant,\" Bartley said. The chant nods to the long-standing push for D.C. home rule and statehood, and grew out of heightened tensions earlier this year, when the Trump administration took control of the district's police force and deployed National Guard troops to the city. Borrowing from the global soccer canon Spirit supporters also borrow from the global soccer canon. When the energy in the stadium dips, they'll sometimes launch into a playful chant appropriated from English Premier League crowds. \"Let's pretend we scored a goal,\" they repeat. New York and New Jersey-based  Gotham FC  supporters — who will be cheering on the Spirit's opponents in the championship match — have similarly embraced U.K. soccer songs. One in particular has become an anthem. John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\" famously sung by Manchester United fans at their stadium, Old Trafford, has taken on a new life in the tri-state area. In 2023, Gotham FC fans reworked the song into \"Gotham Roads,\" a tribute to the team and the region. \"To use 'Country Roads' was actually my idea,\" said Marge Liguori, who leads  Cloud 9 , a big Gotham FC supporters group. \"I do also happen to be a Manchester United fan. So I kind of borrowed that, but worked with other fans to adapt the lyrics.\" All in it together For Liguori, the song resonates because it evokes a sense of home. \"I think that's what we find in our arena and in our community with our team,\" she said. This feeling of belonging is paramount to understanding why singing and chanting are such an integral part of sports events. \"Really, the team is more of just a metaphor for the community,\" said Max Jack, an ethnomusicologist and anthropologist at Indiana University who has studied the intersection of sports and music. He said singing and chanting allow fans to go through the emotional journey that is a soccer game together. \"It creates a sense of stranger intimacy that is incredibly deep and fulfilling,\" Jack said. \"It offers something that most people won't access in their day-to-day life.\" That intimacy extends beyond fan-to-fan relationships. Chants also help build bonds between supporters and the players they root for. After Gotham FC's 2023 NWSL championship, fans  serenaded  defender Mandy Freeman as she approached the stands. Freeman wiped away tears as she hugged fans across the railings. Those interactions — along with the fans' overall enthusiasm — matter to the team, Jeff Greer, Gotham FC's vice president of communications, told NPR. \"When we hear them chanting, we know that they are at our backs pushing us to victory,\" he said. The Spirit feel the same way. Their home matches at Audi Field in Washington D.C. are known for their high-octane atmosphere. \"Our players regularly credit 'Rowdy Audi' for being the 12th player on the field,\" said Spirit director of communications Ben Kessler. \"And a lot of that is because of how creative their chants and cheers are.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   The finals of the National Women's Soccer League are happening this weekend in San Jose, California.

CHLOE VELTMAN, BYLINE: The members of the Spirit Squadron - a major supporters group for the Washington Spirit soccer team - have been preparing all season to cheer on their players this Saturday. Meredith Bartley is the squadron's leader. MEREDITH BARTLEY: We have a chant just for when we score. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #3: (Chanting) Now the ball's in the back of the net. We'll do it again. BARTLEY: We have a chant for having a blast. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #4: (Chanting) You're my favorite soccer team. You're my favorite soccer team ever. BARTLEY: This season, we've started, in the 51st minute, a Free D.C. chant. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #5: (Chanting) Free D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #5: (Chanting) Free D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING) VELTMAN: This is a nod to the push for D.C. home rule and statehood. It began when the Trump administration sent National Guard troops into D.C. earlier this year. BARTLEY: And we have a chant for when it's been a little bit, and it's kind of a little boring, and we want to pretend like we just scored a goal to get everybody hyped back up again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #6: (Singing) Let's pretend, let's pretend we scored a goal. (CHEERING) VELTMAN: That one is inspired by this staple of British football matches - I mean soccer games - belted out here in a YouTube clip featuring Tottenham Hotspur fans. Supporters of Washington Spirit's opponent at this weekend's finals - Gotham FC - have also adopted songs that are popular in U.K. soccer stadiums. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #7: (Singing) Take me home, country roads. VELTMAN: This John Denver hit from YouTube has been a staple at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium for years. In 2023, Gotham FC followers decided to put their own spin on it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #8: (Singing) Gotham roads, take me home to the place I belong. MARGE LIGUORI: To use \"Country Roads\" was actually my idea. VELTMAN: This is Marge Liguori. She heads up the big Gotham FC fan group Cloud 9. LIGUORI: I do also happen to be a Manchester United fan, so I kind of borrowed that but worked with supporters to adapt the lyrics. VELTMAN: Liguori says the song is special because it evokes a sense of home. LIGUORI: And I think that's what we find in our arena and in our community, with our team. MAX JACK: Really, the team is more of just a metaphor for the community. VELTMAN: This is Max Jack, an ethnomusicologist at Indiana University who focuses on sports music. He says chanting and singing allow fans to go through the emotional journey that is a soccer game together. JACK: It creates a sense of stranger intimacy that is incredibly deep and fulfilling. It offers something that most people won't access in their day-to-day life. VELTMAN: And singing and chanting also enable moments of interaction between players and fans.

JEFF GREER: When we hear them chanting, we know that they are at our backs, pushing us to victory. VELTMAN: That's a sentiment shared by the opposition. The Washington Spirit play at Audi Field in D.C. They call it Rowdy Audi because of the stadium's raucous atmosphere, and credit the fans for being the 12th player on the field.

Born in Israel to a French Tunisian father and raised in both France and Israel, Bronchtein has dedicated his life to promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. He first met Macron in 2019 and built a close relationship, offering him direct advice through late-night conversations. His advocacy included a long-standing push for a two-state solution, grounded in the belief that a sovereign Palestinian state would have prevented the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.

peace activist who persuaded France's Macron to recognize a Palestinian state \n         By Eleanor Beardsley \n        \n           Saturday, November 22, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PARIS — Ofer Bronchtein was brought to tears as French President Emmanuel Macron delivered his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September, recognizing a Palestinian state for the first time. \"Honestly, I cried,\" he told NPR in an interview in his Paris apartment after his return from New York. \"I see it happening in front of me and I see the full room of the General Assembly and everyone is applauding.\" Bronchtein says his only regret is that the Israeli delegation walked out of the General Assembly. The Israeli and U.S. governments opposed the move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said world leaders who recognized Palestinian statehood were granting a \" tremendous reward \" to the Palestinian militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Bronchtein refutes this,   arguing it is no reward for a group that never sought a peaceful coexistence alongside Israel. \"I strongly believe that if there had been a Palestinian state before the 7th of October, if the Palestinians had been sovereign to run their lives as they wanted, the 7th of October [attack in Israel] would not have happened,\" he says. For Bronchtein, recognizing a Palestinian state at the U.N. was the culmination of his life's work. The 68-year-old Israeli-French activist has long promoted the recognition of a Palestinian state alongside Israel to help resolve the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In recent years, he has been doing so as an informal adviser to President Macron. Now, as the French continue efforts for a lasting peace in the region, the president's unofficial envoy is pushing for Paris to play a lead role in the process. Talking peace over whisky in Ramallah Bronchtein was first introduced to Macron in 2019 by a mutual friend, he says. The next year, he and the French leader formed a bond during a presidential visit to Jerusalem, where Macron gave a speech on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, and Bronchtein was serving as Hebrew interpreter for France's delegation. On that trip, as Bronchtein tells it, during a late-night whisky they shared in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Macron said he wanted Bronchtein to work with him on peace in the Middle East. Macron understands the issues, and empathizes with both Israelis and Palestinians, Bronchtein explains. The president was looking for a way for France and Europe to play a larger role in the peace process. Bronchtein, president of the nonprofit International Forum for Peace, receives no salary for consulting Macron, he says. He's sitting at his desk covered with books and papers in the cluttered yet cozy Paris apartment he shares with his wife, American photographer Hally Pencer, and their Labrador Leo.  Bronchtein's only condition is a direct line to Macron. \"I whisper in his ear usually after 12 o'clock at night,\" when the president's more available, Bronchtein says. \"My job is to give some ideas, to react to what's happening on the ground. Sometimes he listens to what I have to say, sometimes he doesn't.\" A few months after that Middle East trip, Macron gave Bronchtein his first mission: to find ideas that could bring Palestinians and Israelis together. The activist spoke with hundreds of people across both societies, and assembled what he calls a suggestion toolbox. On top: Arab states should normalize relations with Israel, while Israel should recognize a sovereign Palestinian state. And France should lead the way on statehood recognition. \"When the time comes,\" Bronchtein recalls Macron always saying. Life in and out of Israel and France Bronchtein has French and Israeli passports, as well as a Palestinian one. He was born in the Negev desert town of Beersheba, Israel, in 1957. All of his grandparents were born in what was then Ottoman-controlled Palestine. His paternal grandparents moved to Tunisia, then a French protectorate, where they gained French citizenship. Bronchtein's father, at age 16, left Tunisia for France, and joined the Jewish resistance against the Nazis. After World War II, his father boarded the  Exodus 1947 , a ship filled with hundreds of Holocaust survivors sailing from France to start their lives over in Palestine, which was then under British mandate. He went on to fight both the Arabs and the British for Israeli statehood in 1948. Bronchtein calls his father his hero. Then in 1966, when Bronchtein was 9, the family left Israel for economic reasons and moved to an immigrant suburb of Paris. Bronchtein returned to Israel in 1975, at age 17. And there he began a lifelong fight for social justice, peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Arabs. Jailed for meeting a Palestinian official He worked on building bridges across the divide, even when it was forbidden. In 1987, Bronchtein met in Spain with a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Mahmoud Abbas. (It was nearly two decades before Abbas became president of the Palestinian Authority.) Their encounter in Spain broke Israel's  ban on contacts with PLO  representatives at the time. Bronchtein served 15 days in Israeli prison. Things turned around when he became an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin during the negotiations leading to the 1990s  Oslo Accords . Signed by Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the peace agreements outlined plans for a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Bronchtein remembers the hope surrounding that era. \"After that it was like a honeymoon,\" he says. \"I was living in Tel Aviv at the time. I would take my car and an hour later I was on the beach in Gaza, having dinner with my friends. I did the same thing in the West Bank. We were going in and out without any problem. Many of the Palestinians I met became dear friends of mine.\" He says Palestinians enjoyed some of that freedom too, for a time, but it didn't last. In 1995, Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist. Israelis who opposed the Oslo Accords came to power. A Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada began in 2000. Bronchtein grew cynical and life became dangerous in Israel, with Palestinian attacks on buses. He and his wife moved to France with their three children. Renewed hope for peace Bronchtein says his hope eventually returned, thanks to dear friends on both sides of the conflict, and the desire for peaceful coexistence that those who know him best say is part of his soul. In 2002, Bronchtein and a Palestinian partner, Anis al-Qaq, created the  International Forum for Peace  to foster dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. \"Bronchtein is unique,\" says John Lyndon, executive director of Alliance for Middle East Peace, a network of organizations promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. While Bronchtein's peace forum is not a member of the alliance, Lyndon says the two have partnered together on recent initiatives. \"What's great about Ofer is that he's brought civil society's voice and impatience into what can often be sterile governmental context,\" he says. \"He hasn't lost the fact that he's an activist. I've seen him be the person in the meeting that is maybe upsetting the diplomats by saying the thing they need to hear. He maintains his access and his conversations with Macron, but he also speaks truth to power.\" As a gesture for his work, Palestinian Authority President Abbas gave Bronchtein a Palestinian passport in 2011. But the Israeli-French peace activist has drawn detractors, too. France has Europe's  largest Jewish  and  Muslim communities , and Middle East tensions often play out in the country. Bronchtein says he receives insults from different sides over his activism, and even death threats from extremist Jews in France and Israel. He has refused President Macron's offer of a security detail. \"Pushing the American president in the right direction\" Bronchtein has been a strong critic of Israel's occupation of the West Bank after the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. He believes it goes against Jewish values and dehumanizes Palestinians, which has also fueled Palestinian hatred toward Israelis. And recently, Palestinians in the West Bank have seen an increase in their land confiscated and violence against them by Israeli settlers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the level of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the last two years is something Bronchtein says he never imagined. \"To tell you honestly, I feel ashamed as an Israeli that some people in my name committed this terrible crime,\" he says of Israel's vast destruction of Gaza. \"And lately, when I speak in front of Palestinians or even in the media, I ask for forgiveness. I hope that one day the Palestinians will forgive us for what's happened in Gaza.\" He says Palestinians should also ask forgiveness from Israel \"for the terrible things Hamas did on Oct. 7.\" In the wake of such destruction and loss, Bronchtein thinks there is a real chance to change the status quo. He says \"a lot of Israelis would like to make peace.\" But lasting peace will only be achieved when Palestinians are masters of their own destiny. He believes Hamas will one day be vanquished, but says: \"You cannot kill an ideology through violence. You kill ideology by giving people a chance to hope for a better future.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       France's diplomatic move at the U.N. was deeply planned and coordinated for months with Saudi Arabia, and led countries to revive the call for a two-state solution. Israel  threatened retaliation  for it, and President Trump initially warned it could \" encourage continued conflict .\" But Bronchtein and other  analysts believe  France's move helped lay the groundwork for President Trump's plan for peace in Gaza. Bronchtein says it's time for Israelis and Palestinians to write a new narrative, much like the Europeans did after the destruction of World War II. It should be a project for the future where they are not enemies, but eventually partners, he says. A narrative that respects the history, the identity and the pain of each side. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   When French President Emmanuel Macron recognized a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September, he revived the discussion of a two-state solution in the West. It was also the result of a lifetime's worth of work by one Israeli French peace activist. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley has the story behind this historic move. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French). ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: It was a moment 68-year-old peace activist Ofer Bronchtein had been working for his whole life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MACRON: (Speaking French). OFER BRONCHTEIN: To tell you, honestly, I cried because it's something that I believed in for many, many years, and I see it happening. BEARDSLEY: He only regrets the Israelis walked out and didn't hear Macron's message. BRONCHTEIN: The only way for Israel to be secure and for the Palestinian to achieve their goal of freedom, it's to have sovereignty. (Speaking French). (LAUGHTER) BEARDSLEY: I meet Bronchtein at the cozy, cluttered Paris apartment he shares with his American wife, and aging golden labrador. The longtime activist was first introduced to Macron in 2019 by a mutual friend. The next year, during a presidential visit to Israel where Bronchtein was serving as the French delegation's Hebrew interpreter, the two men formed a bond. Macron noticed Bronchtein's ease and proximity with Palestinians. The Israelis soon became Macron's unofficial peace adviser for the Middle East. Bronchtein does not receive a salary. His only condition is a direct line to the president. BRONCHTEIN: I whisper it in his ear usually after 12 o'clock at night because I know that at night he's more available. BEARDSLEY: The first mission Macron gave Bronchtein was to find ideas that could bring Palestinians and Israelis together. So he assembled a sort of toolbox of suggestions. On top, Arab states should normalize relations with Israel, and Israel must recognize Palestinian sovereignty. The activist pressed for France to lead the way. When the time comes, Macron always told him. It finally did with Hamas' horrific attack on Israel and Israel's devastation of Gaza. BRONCHTEIN: I strongly believe that if it was a Palestinian state before the 7 of October, if the Palestinians were suffering to run their life as they want, the 7 of October would have not happened. BEARDSLEY: Bronchtein was born in Israel a few years after the Jewish state's founding to a French Tunisian father who arrived in British Mandate Palestine, on a ship of Holocaust survivors after World War II. His father went on to fight for Israel's independence in 1948. Bronchtein calls him his hero. BRONCHTEIN: I miss him a lot, my father. For me, he was a guide - so humble. BEARDSLEY: Bronchtein became an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin during the negotiations leading to the 1993 Oslo Accords signed by Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The agreement outlined two states side by side. Bronchtein remembers the hope. BRONCHTEIN: It was like an honeymoon. We were sure that it's happening. I was living in Tel Aviv at the time. I was taking my car, and an hour after I was on the beach in Gaza having dinner with my friends. We were going in and out without any problems. Many of the Palestinians that I met become dear friend of mine. BEARDSLEY: Then in 1995, Rabin was assassinated. A few years later, the second intifada began. Bronchtein says he became cynical. But his hope returned, he says, thanks to dear friends on both sides. Bronchtein shrugs off the death threats he's gotten for his work with Macron. JOHN LYNDON: What's great about Ofer is that he hasn't lost the fact that he's an activist. BEARDSLEY: That's John Lyndon, executive director of the Middle East Peace Alliance, a network of Israeli and Palestinian peace-building NGOs. Lyndon says it's unusual for somebody who's been at this for so long not to become jaded. LYNDON: He's brought civil society's voice and impatience. I've seen him be the person in the meeting that is maybe upsetting the diplomats by saying the thing they need to hear. He still maintains his access and his conversations and Macron at midnight, but he speaks truth to power. BEARDSLEY: Bronchtein says the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian West Bank after the 1967 war has been a terrible thing and runs counter to Jewish humanist values. BRONCHTEIN: We occupied 6 million people, and to be able to justify the occupation, we had to dehumanize them. So the Arab is sick, and the Arab is dirty, and this culture is not a culture. And when you have a bad person in front of you, it's OK to kill her. It's OK to put them in jail without trial. BEARDSLEY: He says Palestinians have done the same thing, painting all Jews as settlers or soldiers. BRONCHTEIN: So it's normal to kill them back. BEARDSLEY: But the level of violence in the last two years is something Bronchtein never imagined. BRONCHTEIN: To tell you, honestly, I feel ashamed as an Israeli that some people on my name committed this terrible crime. I hope that one day, the Palestinian will forgive us for what's happened in Gaza. They will have to decide themselves if they want to ask for forgiveness to the Israeli for the terrible things that Hamas did on the 7 of October. BEARDSLEY: The crisis is so deep this time that Bronchtein believes there is a real chance to change the status quo. BRONCHTEIN: A lot of Israeli would like to make peace with their friends and peace you make with enemies. So it's always difficult, and the compromises are always painful. BEARDSLEY: He believes Hamas will be defeated but says you can't kill an ideology with violence. BRONCHTEIN: You have to kill ideology by giving people a chance to hope for a better future. You have more than 25,000 orphan in Gaza today. If we won't give him a chance to hope that life can be better, he will become terrorist. BEARDSLEY: France became the punching bag for recognizing a Palestinian state, says Bronchtein. But the deeply prepared French-Saudi initiative laid the groundwork for President Trump's Mideast ceasefire plan. BRONCHTEIN: All of that President Trump understood and he saw. So I'm very happy that we played a positive role in pushing the president of the United States in the right direction. BEARDSLEY: It's time for Israelis and Palestinians to write a new narrative, he says, much like the Europeans did after the destruction of World War II. A project for the future where they are not just enemies, one that respects the history, the identity and the pain of the other side. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris.

If you grew tired of waiting, there are more options: a Brendan Fraser-led dramedy, a stirring Marathi-language love story and a documentary  about  a documentary. Wicked: For Good  In theaters Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The yellow brick road is under construction as we rejoin our favorite green and pink Ozian witches. Elphaba, exiled after defying both gravity and the fraud who calls himself a Wizard, is creating as much havoc as she can with just a broom. Glinda, meanwhile, is spreading Wizardly propaganda and \"obsessulating\" over the motorized pink bubble she's been given to make her appear magical. They both have issues with the blowhard Wizard, who is pushing fake news, and is also, let's say, dictatorious, or maybe, fascistified. Things are darker in Oz this time. If you've somehow missed the backstory to this backstory,  Wicked  — first a novel, then a Broadway musical — was conceived as a prequel for adults to the events depicted in  The Wizard of Oz. It was nothing if not complicated, both morally and plot-wise — origin stories for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow were mostly brushed in after the central witch frenemies were well established. But that meant filmmaker Jon M. Chu had a problem when the Broadway hit became  two  movies. The story's early part about growing up has songs that are popular, gravity-defying. The later part, though, is about wising up — about consequences, the politics of oppression. It kinda doesn't sing. So for this movie, Stephen Schwartz wrote a new tune for Ariana Grande about Glinda's life in a bubble — and for Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba, he penned a musical nod to the original Wizard of Oz called \"No Place Like Home.\" And they're fine — fabulously sung, even if they seem just as aimed at original-song Oscar nominations as at filling plot holes. They just can't make this prequel-sequel feel any less dutiful or by the numbers — rehashing bits of the 1939 movie classic, shoehorning in animals who no longer talk, when all you really want is that song that gives  Wicked: For Good  its title. After way too long, the song arrives — powerhouse voices singing about friendship and doing good when good is hard. And for fans, that might make the long, five-hour,  two -movie trek feel worth it. Not for me. I was hoping for at least entrancillating. Rental Family In theaters Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       In director Hikari's sentimental dramedy, Brendan Fraser plays Phillip, an American actor in Tokyo who lands an unusual gig with a Japanese \"rental family\" agency — playing stand-in roles in the lives of strangers. His disorienting first assignment is \"sad white guy\" at a funeral, where he's startled to see the \"corpse\" sit up in his coffin to watch himself being mourned. Phillip's better prepared when he's hired to play the groom in a sham marriage that will free a young woman from her restrictive family. After initial trepidation, he celebrates the success of the ruse by spending the night with a sex worker (presumably for the benefit of audience members unaware that transactional relationships are time-honored). In longer-term engagements — playing an inquisitive journalist so a movie star with dementia will feel he's still remembered, and playing dad to a vulnerable 11-year-old girl — he gets emotionally involved with the folks he's deceiving, and they with him. Phillip's eyes well with tears as the manipulative nature of his relationships become problematic, but the filmmaker isn't nearly as interested in exploring the ramifications as he is in manipulating us. Cactus Pears (Sabar Bonda) In limited theaters starting Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Anand is a 30-something gay city dweller who's been caring for his dying father in Delhi, and who dreads traveling with his mother to their ancestral home in the countryside for ten days of ritual mourning. But once there, Anand reconnects with a childhood friend, also gay, and the two bond over their shared difficulties with families who want to know why they've not taken brides and settled down. Loosely based on filmmaker Rohan Parashuram Kanawade's own experience when his father died, the Marathi-language film offers a laconic but decently stirring portrait of men who struggle with lower-caste social restraints and familial obligations, and who ultimately find solace in each other. Zodiac Killer Project In limited theaters starting Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       With financing and contract negotiations underway, Charlie Shackleton was already scouting locations and storyboarding a documentary when he learned he was being denied the rights to retired California patrolman Lyndon Lafferty's book  The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up . Having gone that far, he couldn't bear to let it go, so he made a film about the film he  would have made , and ends up sending up the whole true crime documentary genre in the process. Wry, precise, earnest, bemused, the filmmaker is forthright about the evocative but manipulative clichés he's employing — cigarette butt-filled ashtrays, reenactments filmed in soft focus from behind, the swinging interrogation light (\"why is it always swinging\"). He also points out the shortcuts he's taking (\"this is actually a library, not a police station\"). The resulting film is amusing, pointed, and gets to the very heart of what makes these documentaries so compelling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98867","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he's terminating legal protections for Somali migrants in Minnesota","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the immediate termination of Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Somali migrants in Minnesota, citing claims of money laundering and gang activity, though these claims were widely criticized as Islamophobic.

Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs. But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide. Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments. The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was \"a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,\" Trump wrote. \"It's OVER!\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump's decision \"will tear families apart.\" Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, \"This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.\" Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally. That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-school-abductions-dc3eaa3f1b9d910211e4a2af959ee7a9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"08:26:18+00:00","title":"303 Schoolchildren Abducted in Nigeria School Attack; Government Closes All Schools Amid Security Crisis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass abduction of 303 schoolchildren and 12 teachers occurred at St. Mary’s Catholic School in the remote Papiri community of Niger state, Nigeria, following a security attack.

The tally was changed “after a verification exercise and a final census was carried out,” according to a statement issued by the Most. Rev.

The students were both male and female and ranged in age from 10 to 18. The school kidnapping in Niger state’s remote Papiri community happened four days after 25 schoolchildren were seized in similar circumstances in neighboring Kebbi state’s Maga town, which is 170 kilometers (106 miles) away. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the abductions and authorities have said tactical squads have been deployed alongside local hunters to rescue the children. Yohanna described as false a claim from the state government that the school had reopened for studies despite an earlier directive for schools in that part of Niger state to close temporarily due to security threats.

UNICEF said last year that only 37% of schools across 10 of the conflict-hit states have early warning systems to detect threats. Niger state has now shut down all schools as a measure to forestall other kidnappings. The decision was in a bid to protect lives and property, Niger Gov. Umar Bago told reporters Saturday after meeting with security officials in Minna. “It is the decision of stakeholders today to close all schools in Niger state. All schools are closed till further notice. So we have declared Christmas holiday for all schools in Niger state,” Bago said. The kidnappings are happening amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims of targeted killings against Christians in the West African country. Attacks in Nigeria affect both Christians and Muslims . The school attack earlier this week in Kebbi state was in a Muslim-majority town.

Kendrick Weeks, Western Wildlife Diversity Program supervisor for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, said the cat dropped on the car could have been roadkill scavenged by the eagle. “But they can take animals the size of a cat,” he said. “It is much harder for them to take a live cat than a dead cat. They usually don’t prey on something they don’t find palatable. And, scavenging is a common behavior in bald eagles.” Eagles and other raptors can drop prey for several reasons, including having a poor grip or if the prey is struggling and the birds are trying to prevent injury to themselves, Weeks added. Prey can also be dropped if a raptor is being harassed by another raptor or the prey becomes too heavy to continue carrying. Bald eagles are native to North Carolina and most of North America. Their populations have been increasing, and there are more than 200 nesting pairs in North Carolina. The birds can weigh anywhere from 6 1/2 to 13 1/2 pounds (3 kilograms to 6.3 kilograms) and have wingspans of 6 to 7 feet (1.8 meters to 2.1 meters), Weeks told The Associated Press."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599934","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"How Could Trump Interfere in the Midterms?

Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County in Colorado, said officials in her state are shoring up their relationships with local law enforcement and county and state attorney's offices, to make sure any effort to interfere with voting is \"met with a pretty good force of resistance.\" \"We have to plan for the worst and hope we get the best,\" Koppes said. \"I think we're all kind of conditioned at this point to expect anything and everything, and our bingo cards keep getting bigger and bigger with things that we would have never have had on them.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump, who continues to spread false claims about voting in America, issued an executive order in the spring that sought to mandate  major changes  to the elections system. That order has so far  mostly been blocked  by the courts, but he's teased other executive action as well. And his administration is still  investigating  his loss five years ago, while  pardoning  people associated with his efforts to try to overturn that defeat. All of that has made it clear to those in the elections community that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a few things voting officials are watching for. More executive action to take control of voting The Constitution is  clear : States control their own election processes, with Congress able to set guidelines for federal races. The president has virtually no authority when it comes to voting. But Trump is testing that, and those in his circle have pushed fringe theories for how he can change how ballots are cast and counted. Earlier this month , press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House is working on a new executive order that will seemingly target mail voting. Trump also said earlier this year that he wanted to  ban some voting machines , though it's unclear exactly what he was referring to. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Election officials agree he does not have the legal authority to do either of those things. But recently, Trump ally and attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump in 2020, broached a bolder strategy to enact election changes: declaring a national emergency. \"The president's authority is limited in his role with regard to elections except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States — as I think that we can establish with the porous system that we have,\" Mitchell said on a  podcast appearance  in September. It would be keeping with one of Trump's broader policy strategies: This year he's invoked presidential emergency powers  more frequently  than any other modern president. Election  experts  say there's no legal basis for Mitchell's theory, but numerous voting officials told NPR it's something that's come up in conversations about next year. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who previously oversaw voting in California as secretary of state, also brought up the scenario recently on the Senate floor. \"If the Trump White House tried to declare some fake national emergency to create a pretense for federal intervention, I will force a vote here in the Senate to stop it,\" Padilla said. Troops on the ground Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, says six months ago he wouldn't have taken the premise of federal troops at polling places seriously. But seeing how the National Guard was deployed — and justified — this summer changed his thinking. \"You have National Guard deploying to cities to supposedly quell these 'demonstrations' — basically  people in frog suits  and riding their  bikes naked  is the biggest threat,\" Hobbs said. \"And yeah, I start thinking that maybe it could be possible.\" Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump  spoke of  a desire to have federal law enforcement patrol voting locations, and this year, his former adviser Steve Bannon said on his  War Room podcast  that he hopes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are patrolling polling places in the midterms. Legal  experts  say such intervention is clearly illegal, but until the federal government disavows such actions clearly, Simon said voting officials have to game out how to respond. \"One thing that would help is if someone at the federal government would come out and categorically say, 'No, no, no, stop the presses, stop everything. You'll never have to worry about that. That's not something we would ever consider doing,'\" Simon said. \"That would go a long way.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to questions about forces outside polling places, and other scenarios mentioned in this story, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson characterized them as \"baseless conspiracy theories and Democrat talking points\" but did not directly answer whether the White House would commit not to send agents to voting locations. She reiterated that the president is permitted to send federal personnel to localities to help quell violent crime. Who is a trusted source? For the last decade, as voting officials have fought to dam up a tsunami of false information about their work, they've begged people in their communities to go to \"trusted sources\" for election information. In 2026, figuring out who is a trusted source may be more difficult than ever. Along with Trump himself, his administration has elevated to prominent government roles  numerous people  who have a history of spreading false information about elections, and local officials worry their message may be drowned out by those with much bigger megaphones. One of the hires alarming voting officials interviewed by NPR works at the Department of Homeland Security. Heather Honey, who's now deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity, worked alongside Mitchell for the past few years to help  spread election conspiracy theories , including one about votes in Pennsylvania that  Trump mentioned  in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a mob stormed the Capitol. \"I equate this to having a moon landing conspiracy theorist and flat earther being offered a job at NASA,\" Hobbs said. DHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Numerous   officials  at the Department of Justice also have a history of election denial. Unprecedented demands The insistence to  relitigate  2020 also has voting officials worried about what sort of actions administration officials plan to take. Already this year, DOJ has made unprecedented requests to investigate  voting machines ,  access  old ballots, and  accumulate  mass amounts of voter data. This summer, a  consultant  in Colorado contacted Koppes and other clerks in that state, in some cases saying he was associated with the White House and asking about accessing their voting machines. The White House denied to  CNN  and  other outlets  authorizing the requests, but separately,  in Missouri , a Department of Justice official reached out to clerks there asking basically the same thing. In each instance, they were told no. \"Since 2020, people in the elections world have become even more knowledgeable of the responsibilities of the different levels of government [when it comes to voting equipment],\" Koppes said. A similar push and pull is playing out with elections data. The Trump administration has quickly built what is essentially a  searchable national citizenship database , and is trying to entice states to run their voting records through it to root out noncitizens on voter rolls. While many Republican election officials have eagerly embraced the system, other GOP officials and their Democratic counterparts have been  hesitant to engage with the tool , as there are questions about how well it works, what happens to the voting data once it's been run through the system and, in many states, whether even using the tool is legal under state law. Still, the administration is intent to investigate voter rolls as it continues to push  false narratives  about widespread noncitizen voting. The DOJ recently  sued  eight states (all states Trump lost in 2020) in an effort to compel them to turn over their rolls. \"It's really not a red state or blue state thing,\" said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of state of Pennsylvania, in an  interview with PBS News Hour  about the data demands. \"It is a — in my view, a concerning attempt, a concerning effort to consolidate and overreach at the federal level. In the United States of America, it's the states who run elections, not the federal government.\" Vulnerable targets Since Trump took office, the federal government has pulled back on virtually all of its work related to cybersecurity and elections. The Department of Homeland Security  laid off  employees focused on election security, and stopped  funding  a partnership that helped local elections offices share threat information. Wesley Wilcox, a Republican election supervisor in Marion County, Fla., said smaller counties especially will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the cuts, and Russia, China or any other U.S. adversary may see an opportunity. \"That's what I would do,\" Wilcox said. \"I mean, if I were on that side of the fence, I'm like, 'OK, they're cutting this stuff out. Let's go get them.' You know, 'cause the defenses are down.\" Secretary Hobbs, of Washington, told NPR that two years ago he was notified by DHS about a hack in one of his counties. The state responded immediately to make sure the breach wouldn't impact the voter registration database. Now, Hobbs said, \"I don't even know if I would have gotten that phone call, to tell you the truth.\" In Arizona, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat,  said  he didn't even contact DHS' cyber agency after an online candidate portal was hacked this summer because he didn't have confidence in the agency's \"capacity to collaborate in good faith or to prioritize national security over political theater.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5616287","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00-05:00","title":"Senate Democrats Investigate Kennedy Center for Cronyism, Corruption","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senate Democrats, led by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, are investigating the John F.

Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees public buildings,  is investigating leadership  at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for what he says are \"millions in lost revenue, luxury spending, and preferential treatment for Trump allies.\" The committee's ranking member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) sent a letter outlining the claims to Kennedy Center president, Richard Grenell. Grenell denied the allegations in a letter that was  posted  to the Kennedy Center's social media. The Kennedy Center's building is maintained by the federal government, though its programming and staff are supported by a combination of private and federal funds. Whitehouse's letter, plus documentation obtained by Democrats on the Senate committee, are  posted on its website . The documents appear to show that non-arts groups are getting significant discounts on rental fees at the Kennedy Center. There is a copy of a contract with FIFA that shows the international soccer organization will not pay the usual $5 million in rental fees when it takes over the center for three weeks in order to announce next year's World Cup draw, as first  reported  by  The Washington Post . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Senate Democrats obtained copies of contracts given to Grenell's friends and associates, worth tens of thousands of dollars. In his letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said these and other actions show a \"profound disregard\" for leadership's \"fiduciary responsibility.\" Allegations of financial mismanagement come at a time of  declining  audiences, artist  cancellations ,  layoffs  and resignations at the Kennedy Center. An  analysis  by  The Washington Post  found that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have taken a nosedive; on average, 43% of tickets have not been sold since early September. On the same day as the  Post 's reporting, Grenell  announced  the center had raised \"a record-breaking\" $58 million from donors and sponsors in 30 days \"with more on the horizon.\" In his response to Whitehouse, Grenell  wrote  that he is \"concerned about your careless attacks on me and my team\" and that the Senator's letter is \"filled with partisan attacks and false accusations.\" Grenell denied Whitehouse's claims and alleged financial mismanagement by the center's previous leadership, including \"a bloated staff\" and \"deferred maintenance\" that \"was quite literally making the building fall apart.\" President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act  includes  $257 million for repairs, maintenance and restoration of the Kennedy Center. Addressing the claim that FIFA will be using the center for free, instead of paying a $5 million rental fee to the Kennedy Center, Grenell said the international soccer organization has \"given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.…A simple rental fee would not have been enough to cover the magnitude of the event.\" Grenell has slammed previous Kennedy Center leadership a number of times. In this week's letter to Whitehouse, he wrote that \"for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\" In May he  told  the Kennedy Center board the \"deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center is criminal.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Former Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter and board chair David Rubenstein  rejected  Grenell's characterization of their work. Rutter wrote, \"Perhaps those now in charge are facing significant financial gaps and are seeking to attribute them to past management.\" In a statement to NPR from May, Rubenstein said, \"financial reports were reviewed and approved by the Kennedy Center's audit committee and full board as well as a major accounting firm.\" That audit committee included board members appointed by Trump during his first term,  including  U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was a special advisor to Trump and worked on his defense team during his Senate impeachment trial.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse sent a letter with a long list of concerns to the center's president, the former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. NPR's Elizabeth Blair joins us. Elizabeth, thanks so much for being with us. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: The Kennedy Center's a federal government operation. Senator Whitehouse is on the committee that oversees public buildings. But what prompts these claims? BLAIR: The announcement on the website for the Senate subcommittee for Environment and Public Works says that current leadership is responsible for millions in lost revenue, luxury spending and preferential treatment for Trump allies. The letter from Whitehouse to Grenell had a bunch of concerns, among them that non-arts groups are getting discounts on rental fees when they use the Kennedy Center and that FIFA, the international soccer organization, will not be paying about $5 million in rent when it's there for three weeks. FIFA will be announcing the World Cup soccer draw from the Kennedy Center on December 5. He also expressed concerns about lavish spending and - at hotels and restaurants. SIMON: Ever since President Trump took over the Kennedy Center, there have been reports that ticket sales are down. Artists, including a production of \"Hamilton,\" have canceled shows. Longtime staff have resigned or have been laid off, haven't they? BLAIR: Yeah. All true. The Washington Post recently did an analysis and found that since September, ticket sales are down by 43%. SIMON: What does the Kennedy Center say? BLAIR: Richard Grenell insists that things are just fine - even better under his leadership. He has disparaged previous leadership many times in the past. In a letter responding to Senator Whitehouse, he says the staff was bloated and that the deferred maintenance was so bad that the building was falling apart. He also says that for the first time in decades, the Kennedy Center has a balanced budget. The Kennedy Center's building is maintained by the federal government, though its programming and staff are supported by a combination of private and federal dollars. In his response to Whitehouse, Grenell wrote that he is, concerned about your careless attacks on me and my team, and that the senator's letter is filled with partisan attacks and false accusations. SIMON: Where does this disagreement go from here? BLAIR: So Senator Whitehouse is requesting the Kennedy Center supply him with documents and information about the center's financial management practices, expenditures, donors and contracts under Grenell's leadership by December 4. SIMON: NPR culture correspondent Elizabeth Blair. Thanks so much for being with us. BLAIR: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609020","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:42:00-11:18","title":"In Ben Stiller's showbiz family, there was little separation between home and stage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ben Stiller reflects on his parents’ legacy as a comedy duo, Jerry and Anne Stiller, who gained fame in the 1960s and 1970s through their appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and later as Frank Costanza on Seinfeld.

Just ask  Ben Stiller , whose parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, formed a hit comedy duo in the 1960s and '70s.  \"My mom usually wouldn't want to talk to people for a long time ... and my dad would talk to people forever,\" Stiller says. \"As kids ... you feel that your parent's attention [is] being taken away from you.\" Meara died in 2015  and her husband  followed in 2020 . After his father's death, Ben Stiller found a stash of audio recordings his dad had made of his conversations and arguments with Meara about their marriage and their act. Those tapes are at the center of Stiller's new documentary about his parents,  Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost.   Stiller says his father was always more committed to comedy than his mother, who studied under  Uta Hagen  and dreamed of being a serious actor. They had been married for several years, both struggling to make it in show business, when Jerry Stiller had the idea to create short comedy sketches together. \"He drew her into doing this comedy act,\" his son says. \"And that changed their lives.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The comedy team of Stiller and Meara would go on to appear on  The Ed Sullivan Show  more than 30 times. Later, Jerry Stiller co-starred on  Seinfeld , playing Frank Costanza, George's father. Meanwhile, Ben Stiller was forging his own path in Hollywood, both as an actor and a filmmaker.  Stiller is currently the executive producer and director of the TV series,  Severance , about a company that makes its employees get a procedure on their brain that separates the memories of their home life and the memories of their work life. The premise is almost the direct opposite of the lifestyle his parents modeled while he was growing up.  \"Their marriage, their relationship ... was also what their act was about,\" Stiller says. \"So I think that concept of the separation is actually really very interesting to me because it's something I've never had.\" Interview highlights On Jerry Stiller's desire to be loved by everyone \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I think I can identify. ... I think most actors have a certain sense of wanting approval. ... He'd talk about it very openly. He said, \"I need that love from the audience.\" It's kind of armchair psychology, but ... he didn't get a lot of nurturing from [his parents] when he was a kid. ... They fought a lot, and they were very poor, and nobody was encouraging him to go into show business. ... He went to Syracuse University and he performed in plays and he found his people and found this warmth and acceptance in the theater, and he was always connecting with people. I think he loved talking to people. He loved when fans would come up and say hi to him. And it meant something to him, and my mother had a very different relationship with it. On the fun part of having celebrity parents I remember when they played nightclubs in New York and that was really exciting for us. We get to stay up late, hang out with the grownups. Interesting, funny people coming in and out of the house. They would have these New Year's Eve parties at their apartment in the late '70s and the '80s that were just amazing. ... As kids, it was really fun to be around. I loved going on sets when they would go out to LA. … To be on the Paramount studios lot ... made me want to make movies. Being around that, it was very clear early on that that's what I wanted to do. It was a lot of fun times and more interesting to my sister and I than school, for sure. On sneaking out while his parents traveled for work \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Our nanny, Hazel, took care of us basically since I think the time that I was probably about 4 years old. She was from Jamaica and she had seven kids of her own and they lived in Brooklyn and we became very close with her family, with her kids, because some of them were Amy and my age. My parents would go away for, like, a two-week stint to LA to do whichever game show or  Love Boat  or whatever it was. Hazel was so sweet. She knew she had to be the disciplinarian and keep us in line, but ... it was kind of like a free-for-all a little bit when we were on our own. We'd stay up late sometimes, trying to sneak out.  As we got older and became teenagers, then there were other things going on, like my sister started going to Studio 54 when I think she was, like, 17 and I was 13. And she would take me to Studio 54 with her friends and they would sneak us in. They put me in a yellow and green polka-dotted Fiorucci shirt ... and an Army jacket and these Mickey Mouse sunglasses. And they put this outfit on me and we went up and [the bouncer] Mark saw us and he pointed to us and said, \"Come on in.\" And we were in. And that happened a few times. So I think I was 13. On calling his dad when he had a bad LSD trip I took LSD once when my parents were out doing  The Love Boat  once. … I was the guy who called his parents on LSD. I called them up in LA because I was scared. I was having a bad trip and [it was] the only time I ever did LSD. My mom got really mad at me. And my dad was actually much nicer and kind of tried to help talk me down. And he said, \"I understand what you're going through. When I was 11 years old, I smoked a Pall Mall cigarette and I was sick for two days.\" And I was like, \"No dad, you don't understand. I don't understand what reality is.\" But he was great. He was actually great about it. On his father being cast as Frank Costanza on  Seinfeld It was life-changing for him. He was a very lovable guy and ... people just loved seeing him let out all this emotion and kind of this tamped up rage that he had inside in a very funny way. And I think the fame that it brought in, because  Seinfeld  was such a phenomenon, was like nothing he had ever experienced before. It was fulfilling for him, I think, a childhood dream of being someone who could be funny on his own. …  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       For me, I was kind of just starting to experience success on my own. So I was happy that my dad was working and that he was in this show that was such a phenomenon. There was never competition between us. … My mom was the one who sort of was, I think, having to deal with not having that kind of success at that point. But for her, I don't think it was as important a thing and as relevant to her own personal happiness, though I think she would have liked to have worked more as an actor.

Actor Ted Danson and TV writer-producer Michael Schur, who teamed up for the successful afterlife comedy \"The Good Place,\" have gotten together again for another sitcom - Netflix's \"A Man On The Inside.\" The series is back with Season 2. And our TV critic David Bianculli says the show is one of the most entertaining and relatively unappreciated series currently on TV. Here's his review. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: Michael Schur's inspiration for \"A Man On The Inside\" was a really unusual one. It's based on a documentary from Chile called \"The Mole Agent,\" which told the story of an octogenarian hired by a private eye firm to solve a case of theft in an elder care facility by going undercover as a new resident. Schur cast Ted Danson, the pivotal player in his wildly surprising \"The Good Place\" sitcom, in the central role and surrounded him with endearing and talented co-stars and supporting players. The first season of \"A Man On The Inside\" was very funny, and its central mystery was a good one. But most of all, the series was about family and friendship and explorations of such issues as trust, usefulness and mortality. Like \"The Good Place,\" it was a very philosophical comedy. And now, for Season 2, \"A Man On The Inside\" returns with an even stronger story. With the way Michael Schur flipped the entire premise of \"The Good Place\" for Season 2 of that show, you know he's capable of some unexpected plot twists, and he serves up several of them here. This time, the setting is a small college, where a wealthy and abrasive major benefactor has rubbed lots of people the wrong way. The school administrators come to the detective agency run by Julie - played, as last season, by Lilah Richcreek Estrada - to investigate acts of theft and vandalism targeting the controversial donor. And she, in turn, dispatches Charles, played by Ted Danson, to go undercover by assuming a role he once held in his own past - professor of engineering. This allows for a whole new cast of supporting characters, and this season of \"A Man On The Inside\" delivers magnificently. One faculty member, a music teacher, is played by Danson's real-life wife, actress Mary Steenburgen, who charms Charles instantly. Me, too. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A MAN ON THE INSIDE\") TED DANSON: (As Charles) You look so familiar. Could we have met before somehow? MARY STEENBURGEN: (As Mona Margadoff) Possible, but most people our age recognize me from Lavender Highway. (Singing) Now it's goodbye, baby. Well, it's goodbye, baby. Well, it's not like me to stay too long. DANSON: (As Charles) I remember that song. Was that you? STEENBURGEN: (As Mona Margadoff) That was me. That was my band. I was 18 years old. We played at Woodstock. DANSON: (As Charles) Wow. You know, we had weirdly similar lives because when I was 18, I was on the local news for growing a really large squash. So I guess we both understand fame. BIANCULLI: Another \"Man On The Inside\" newcomer is David Strathairn. I've loved his work ever since he played a bookstore owner on \"The Days And Nights Of Molly Dodd\" in the '80s. You may remember him from such movies as \"The Firm,\" \"Lincoln\" or \"Good Night, And Good Luck.\" In \"A Man On The Inside,\" he gives Danson someone really feisty to play against. It's not Sam and Diane from \"Cheers,\" but I cheer every scene they play together. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A MAN ON THE INSIDE\") DANSON: (As Charles) So what's your specialty within the department? DAVID STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) I teach romantic poetry and the 19th century novel. DANSON: (As Charles) Just one novel? Sounds easy. STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Droll. If you'll excuse me, I have to get ready. DANSON: (As Charles) I assume you're going to the cocktail party later for Brad Vinick? STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) I am, out of professional necessity. DANSON: (As Charles) You don't approve of Vinick? STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Do I approve of Vinick? Did Antigonus (ph) approve of Atizyes (ph)? DANSON: (As Charles) Boy, I don't know. STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Oh, I apologize. I forgot what you teach. I'll ask it in a way you can understand. Did Garfield approve of not having lasagna? DANSON: (As Charles) Come on now. Engineering is an advanced science. STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Oh, yes. That bridge is big. What if we built one that's bigger? BIANCULLI: Yet another new cast member and terrific foil for the other actors is Gary Cole, who plays the wealthy donor Brad Vinick. Like Steenburgen and Danson, Cole also broke out as an actor in the 1980s in the murder mystery miniseries \"Fatal Vision.\" He's bounced ever since between comedy and drama, including memorable stints playing the same character, Kurt, on \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Good Fight.\" In \"A Man On The Inside,\" his character enjoys repelling just about everyone, including investigator Julie. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A MAN ON THE INSIDE\") LILAH RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) Mr. Vinick, Julie Kovalenko, the PI in charge of the investigation. GARY COLE: (As Brad Vinick) I'll tell you what I told the State Department. I was in Belarus for a wedding, and I didn't use my own passport so I could surprise them. Wait, wait. Which investigation? RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) Wheeler College? The portrait? COLE: (As Brad Vinick) Oh, oh, right, yeah. Yeah, listen, I'm pissed off. I'm giving Wheeler a lot of money, and this is the thanks I get? RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) I have a lot of promising leads, and I assure you we will find the person responsible. COLE: (As Brad Vinick) You seem competent. Pretty hot too. I like that. How old are you? RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) Oh, you're definitely not supposed to ask me that. COLE: (As Brad Vinick) Say you're over 30. BIANCULLI: Michael Schur, whose other comedy credits include \"Parks And Recreation,\" and his writing staff clearly have a blast making this show.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a loyal supporter-turned-critic of President Donald Trump who faced his political retribution if she sought reelection, said Friday she is resigning from Congress in January. Greene, in a more than 10-minute video posted online, explained her decision and said she didn’t want her congressional district “to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for,” she said. Greene’s resignation followed a public falling-out with Trump in recent months, as the congresswoman criticized him for his stance on files related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with foreign policy and health care. Trump branded her a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he would endorse a challenger against her when she ran for reelection next year. She said her last day would be Jan. 5, 2026. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night. In a brief phone call Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene’s resignation is “great news for the country.” He said had no plans to speak with Greene but wishes her well.

Here’s what to know about her five years in Congress 4 MIN READ Greene was one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again politics, and she embraced some of his unapologetic political style. Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over conservatives, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump. The congresswoman, who recorded the video announcing her resignation while sitting in her living room wearing a cross necklace and with a Christmas tree and a peace lily plant behind her, said, “My life is filled with happiness, and my true convictions remain unchanged, because my self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.” A crack in the MAGA movement Greene had been closely tied to the Republican president since she launched her political career five years ago. In her video Friday, she underscored her longtime loyalty to Trump except on a few issues, and said it was “unfair and wrong” that he attacked her for disagreeing. “Loyalty should be a two-way street and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district’s interest, because our job title is literally ‘representative,’” she said. Greene swept to office at the forefront of Trump’s MAGA movement and quickly became a lightning rod on Capitol Hill for her often beyond-mainstream views. In her video Friday, Greene said she had “always been despised in Washington, D.C., and just never fit in.” As she embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory and appeared with white supremacists, Greene was initially opposed by party leaders but welcomed by Trump.

She was a trusted voice on the right flank, until McCarthy was ousted in 2023. While there has been an onslaught of lawmakers from both parties heading for the exits ahead of next fall’s midterm elections, as the House struggles through an often chaotic session, Greene’s announced retirement will ripple throughout the ranks — and raise questions about her next moves. Greene was first elected to the House in 2020 . She initially planned to run in a competitive district in northern Atlanta’s suburbs, but relocated to the much more conservative 14th District in Georgia’s northwest corner. The opening in her district means Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will have to set a special election date within 10 days of Greene’s resignation. Such a special election would fill out the remainder of Greene’s term through January 2027. Those elections could take place before the party primaries in May for the next two-year term. Conspiracy-minded Even before her election, Greene showed a penchant for harsh rhetoric and conspiracy theories, suggesting a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mused that a “so-called” plane had hit the Pentagon. Greene argued in 2019 that Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both Muslim women, weren’t “official” members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies. She was once a sympathizer with QAnon , an online network that believes a global cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got “sucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.” Rep.

She also drew ridicule and condemnation after a conspiracy she speculated about on Facebook in 2018, in which she suggested a California wildfire may have been caused by “lasers or blue beams of light” controlled by a left-wing cabal tied to a prominent Jewish family. When Trump was out of power between his first and second terms, Greene was often a surrogate for his views and brash style in Washington. While then-President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address in 2022, Greene stood up and began chanting “Build the wall,” referring to the U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump began in his first term. Last year, when Biden gave his last State of the Union address, Greene again drew attention as she confronted him over border security and the killing of a nursing student from Georgia, Laken Riley, by an immigrant in the country illegally. Greene, wearing a red MAGA hat and a T-shirt about Riley, handed the president a button that said “Say Her Name.” The congresswoman then shouted that at the president midway through his speech. Frustration with the GOP But this year, her first serving with Trump in the White House, cracks began to appear slowly in her steadfast support — before it broke wide open. Greene’s discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn’t run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn’t win. Greene’s restlessness only intensified in July, when she announced she wouldn’t run for Georgia governor, either. She was also frustrated with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, which worked in lockstep with the president. Greene said in her video that “the legislature has been mostly sidelined” since Republicans took unified control of Washington in January and her bills “just sit collecting dust.” Rep.

Friday that it could face a pivotal choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs, as leaders discuss a U.S. peace proposal seen as favoring Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, cautiously welcomed the U.S. plan to end Moscow’s nearly four-year war in Ukraine, which contains many of the Kremlin’s longstanding demands while offering limited security guarantees to Ukraine. Putin said it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement,” while accusing Ukraine of opposing the plan and being unrealistic. The plan foresees Ukraine handing over territory to Russia — something Kyiv has repeatedly ruled out — while reducing the size of its army and blocking its coveted path to NATO membership. Zelenskyy, in his address hours earlier, did not reject the plan outright, but insisted on fair treatment while pledging to “work calmly” with Washington and other partners in what he called “truly one of the most difficult moments in our history.” He said he spoke for almost an hour Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll about the peace proposal.

AP AUDIO: Zelenskyy says Ukraine faces a stark choice and risks losing American support over US peace plan AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the tough choice facing Ukraine. But he said the “text has not been discussed with us in any substantive way, and I can guess why,” adding that Washington has so far been unable to gain Ukraine’s consent. “Ukraine is against it. Apparently, Ukraine and its European allies are still under illusions and dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield,” Putin said. Trump says he wants Ukraine to respond within a week Trump said Zelenskyy is going to have to come to terms with the U.S. proposal, and if he doesn’t, “they should just keep fighting, I guess.” Asked by reporters about Zelenskyy saying his country faces a difficult choice, Trump alluded to their tense meeting in February that led to a brief rupture in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship: “You remember right in the Oval Office not so long ago? I said you don’t have the cards.” Trump in a radio interview earlier Friday said he wants an answer from Zelenskyy on his 28-point plan by Thursday, but said an extension is possible to finalize terms. “I’ve had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines,” Trump said in an interview on “The Brian Kilmeade Show” on Fox News Radio. “But Thursday is it — we think an appropriate time.” While Zelenskyy has offered to negotiate with the U.S. and Russia, he signaled Ukraine has to confront the possibility of losing American support if it makes a stand. He urged Ukrainians to “stop fighting” each other, in a possible reference to a major corruption scandal that has brought fierce criticism of the government, and said peace talks next week “will be very difficult.” Europe says it will keep supporting Ukraine Zelenskyy spoke earlier by phone with the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, who assured him of their continued support, as European officials scrambled to respond to the U.S. proposals that apparently caught them unawares. Wary of antagonizing Trump, the European and Ukrainian leaders cautiously worded their responses and pointedly commended American peace efforts. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer assured Zelenskyy of “their unchanged and full support on the way to a lasting and just peace” in Ukraine, Merz’s office said. The four leaders welcomed U.S. efforts to end the war. “In particular, they welcomed the commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine and the readiness to grant Ukraine solid security guarantees,” the statement added. The line of contact must be the departure point for an agreement, they said, and “the Ukrainian armed forces must remain in a position to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine effectively.” Starmer said the right of Ukraine to “determine its future under its sovereignty is a fundamental principle.” Existential threat to Europe European countries see their own futures at stake in Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion and have insisted on being consulted in peace efforts. “Russia’s war against Ukraine is an existential threat to Europe. We all want this war to end. But how it ends matters,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in Brussels. “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded. Ultimately, the terms of any agreement are for Ukraine to decide.” Trump in his radio interview pushed back against the notion that the settlement, which offers plentiful concessions to Russia, would embolden Putin to carry out further malign action on his European neighbors. “He’s not thinking of more war,” Trump said of Putin. “He’s thinking punishment. Say what you want. I mean, this was supposed to be a one-day war that has been four years now.” A European government official said the U.S. plans weren’t officially presented to Ukraine’s European backers. Many of the proposals are “quite concerning,” the official said, adding that a bad deal for Ukraine would also be a threat to broader European security. The official was not authorized to discuss the plan publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. European Council President Antonio Costa, in Johannesburg, said of the U.S. proposals, “The European Union has not been communicated any plans in (an) official manner.” Proposal meets with skepticism in the US Senate “This so-called ‘peace plan’ has real problems, and I am highly skeptical it will achieve peace,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Ukraine should not be forced to give up its lands to one of the world’s most flagrant war criminals in Vladimir Putin.” Wicker added that Ukraine should be allowed to determine the size of its military and Putin should not be rewarded with assurances from the U.S. Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said there’s “general concern and alarm that this is a Russian wish list proposal.” Ukraine examines the proposals Ukrainian officials said they were weighing the U.S. proposals, and Zelenskyy said he expected to talk to Trump about it in coming days. A U.S. team began drawing up the plan soon after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Rustem Umerov, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that Umerov agreed to most of the plan, after making several modifications, and then presented it to Zelenskyy. However, Umerov on Friday denied that version of events. He said he only organized meetings and prepared the talks. He said technical talks between the U.S. and Ukraine were continuing in Kyiv. “We are thoughtfully processing the partners’ proposals within the framework of Ukraine’s unchanging principles — sovereignty, people’s security, and a just peace,” he said. ___ Hatton contributed from Lisbon, Portugal.

The tally was changed \"after a verification exercise and a final census was carried out,\" according to a statement issued by the Most. Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, chairman of the Niger state chapter of CAN, who visited the school on Friday. He said 88 other students \"were also captured after they tried to escape\" during the attack. The students were both male and female and ranged in age from 10 to 18. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The school kidnapping in Niger state's remote Papiri community happened four days after 25 schoolchildren were seized in similar circumstances in neighboring Kebbi state's Maga town, which is 170 kilometers (106 miles) away. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the abductions and authorities have said tactical squads have been deployed alongside local hunters to rescue the children. Yohanna described as false a claim from the state government that the school had reopened for studies despite an earlier directive for schools in that part of Niger state to close temporarily due to security threats. \"We did not receive any circular. It must be an afterthought and a way to shift blame,\" he said, calling on families \"to remain calm and prayerful.\" School kidnappings have come to define insecurity in Africa's most populous nation, and armed gangs often see schools as \"strategic\" targets to draw more attention. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       UNICEF said last year that only 37% of schools across 10 of the conflict-hit states have early warning systems to detect threats.

Umar Bago told reporters Saturday after meeting with security officials in Minna. \"It is the decision of stakeholders today to close all schools in Niger state. All schools are closed till further notice. So we have declared Christmas holiday for all schools in Niger state,\" Bago said. The kidnappings are happening amid U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of targeted killings against Christians in the West African country. Attacks in Nigeria affect both Christians and Muslims. The school attack earlier this week in Kebbi state was in a Muslim-majority town. The attack also took place as Nigerian National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu was visiting the U.S. where he met Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/climate-cop30-brazil-talks-global-warming-17b1f32b1e3ac97f565553bc911b2a2c","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:26+00:00","title":"COP30 Climate Summit in Brazil Reaches Subdued Agreement on Adaptation Funding, Lacking Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Language","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, concluded with a lukewarm agreement that pledged tripled climate adaptation funding—aiming at $120 billion annually, though delayed by five years—while omitting explicit language on phasing out fossil fuels.

But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries’ inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded. The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels. The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline , was crafted after hours of late night and early morning meetings. After the deal was approved, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.” Related Stories Takeaways from the outcome of UN climate talks in Brazil 4 MIN READ Alaska Native villages have few options and little US help as climate change devours their land 5 MIN READ At UN climate conference, some activists and scientists want more talk on reforming agriculture 4 MIN READ U.N.

What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.” U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.” André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 president, bangs a gavel during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N.

After the main package was approved — to applause by many delegates — angry nations took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong that do Lago temporarily halted the session to try to calm things down. Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.” An area that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention. The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The European Union, several Latin American countries and Canada said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object but were ignored. Do Lago apologized. How major issues were handled A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade. “COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa. Critics complained there was not much to the deal. “Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: The emperor has no clothes,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International. Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal. “A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.” Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set. The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future. Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said. After the main deal was approved, tempers flared as the open meeting stretched on. Russia’s ambassador at large, Sergei Kononuchenko, lectured Latin American delegates who were objecting frequently that they were “behaving like children who want to get your hands on all the sweets, and aren’t prepared to share them with everyone.” An angry Eliana Ester Saissac of Argentina said Latin Americans “are in no way behaving like spoiled children who want to stuff our mouths full of sweets” to a roar of cheers and applause. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

back at 2025, they might remember it as the year when the government took even tighter control of the internet. Credit cards that won’t buy a ticket on public transport. ATMs that don’t connect to a network. Messaging apps that are down. Cellphones that don’t receive texts or data after a trip abroad. Mothers of diabetic children even complain with alarm that they can’t monitor their kids’ blood glucose levels during outages. The cellphone internet shutdowns, ostensibly to thwart Ukrainian drone attacks , have hit dozens of Russian regions for months. Popular messaging apps also are restricted, with the government promoting a state-controlled app seen by critics as a possible surveillance tool. Although broadband and Wi-Fi internet access remain unaffected, Russians contacted by The Associated Press described digital disruptions to their daily lives. All spoke on condition of not being fully identified for their own safety.

In November, 57 Russian regions on average reported daily disruptions to cellphone links, according to Na Svyazi, an activist group monitoring shutdowns. Authorities say these outages are designed to prevent Ukrainian drones from tapping mobile networks for navigation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they are “absolutely justified and necessary,” but analyst Kateryna Stepanenko of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said they haven’t been effective in curbing the intensity of Ukraine’s drone attacks, “given the amount of strikes we’ve seen in recent months on Russian oil refineries.” In many regions, only a handful of government-approved Russian websites and online services — designated as being on “white lists” — are available during connectivity blackouts. What’s available on the “white lists” varies by provider and includes official websites, email and social media platforms, two online markets, and the Russian search engine Yandex and its services. One provider offers access to a banking app, but others don’t. Authorities have promised to expand the lists. Marina, who lives in the Pacific coast city of Vladivostok, described her anxiety when she discovered only one app for a government-controlled bank was working during a mobile internet outage and she wondered what this meant for the future. “For me, this is the scariest thing,” she said. “The loss of information, the loss of freedom, essentially, is the most depressing thing for me.” In the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of Moscow, one resident described how his credit card didn’t work when he tapped it on the payment terminal on a tram during an outage. He wasn’t carrying enough cash. Families with diabetic children say they can’t monitor their children’s glucose levels via special apps when they are at school and cellphone internet is down. Mothers in social media posts explain that children often can miss the moment when their blood sugar levels change, requiring an intervention, and special apps allowed parents to see that remotely and warn them. Connection outages disrupt that. Authorities have tried touting the joys of reconnecting with a technology-free lifestyle. Internet regulatory agency Roskomnadzor posted a cartoon on social media showing two views of a young man: one in a dark apartment staring at his phone and another strolling happily in a park, carrying a cup of coffee and a book. Going offline “doesn’t mean losing touch. Sometimes it means getting in touch with yourself,” the cartoon advised. But the post mostly drew angry and sarcastic comments. Restrictions set on SIM cards One recent anti-drone restriction sets 24-hour “cooling periods” during which data and texts are blocked from SIM cards that were carried abroad or have been inactive for 72 hours. The owner can unblock it via a link received by text message. Unblocking becomes impossible, however, if a SIM card is used in internet-connected appliances or equipment without interfaces for receiving text messages, like portable Wi-Fi routers, cars or meter boxes. Lawmaker Andrei Svintsov noted that Russia has many electricity meters with SIM cards that transmit readings once a month. “Does this mean they’ll all die? All the heating boilers will shut down, and all the Chinese cars will stop working? This is a massive problem, and I don’t know if the government is even aware of it,” he said. Messaging apps are targeted Other restrictions targeted two popular messaging apps: WhatsApp, with about 96 million monthly users in October, and Telegram, with 91 million, according to media monitoring group Mediascope. Authorities began restricting calls on these apps in August, supposedly to stop phone scams, and are throttling them in some parts of Russia. Yelena, in the southern city of Krasnodar, recalled a time in October when Telegram wasn’t available at all, affecting the work of her and her colleagues. Neither app is on the government “white list.” On the list is Russian messaging service MAX. Authorities actively promote it and since September the service is required to be preinstalled on all smartphones in Russia. Critics see it as a surveillance tool as MAX openly declares it will share user data with authorities upon request. Experts also say it doesn’t use end-to-end encryption. State institutions, officials and businesses are being encouraged to move communications and blogs to MAX. Marina, the Vladivostok resident, said her employers are insisting on people using MAX, to little enthusiasm. She said she doesn’t plan to install it, and neither do others contacted by the AP. MAX developers boast of about 50 million users registering on the platform that it says provides messaging and other services. Mediascope said MAX had about 48 million monthly users in October, but only 18.9 million average daily users, which is far less than the average daily totals of 81 million for WhatsApp and 68 million for Telegram. Russians shrug at restrictions Denis Volkov, director of the Levada Center, Russia’s top independent pollster, said many Russians regard the restrictions the same way they feel about the weather: Ultimately, you can do nothing about it. The authorities’ strategy appears to be to make it difficult for average users to access “alternative content” so that they eventually stop seeking it, Volkov said. Those “who are not that interested will pick simpler channels and ways” to navigate the internet, he said. That sentiment was echoed by the Ulyanovsk resident who said he uses a virtual private network to access some of the blocked websites and platforms, but VPNs also are routinely blocked, so he must install a new one every few months.

Mikhail Klimarev, executive director of the Internet Protection Society activist group, says the internet is tied to too many economic activities to shut it totally. “Groceries are being shipped to stores — this is being done via internet, the ordering, the processing, and so on,” he said. “A truck is on the road, it is connected to an information system, maps, navigation, all of it.” But he forecasts more stifling of websites, VPNs and platforms including totally blocking messenger apps Telegram and WhatsApp and possibly other, unexpected measures. “Honestly, I’m watching it all with raised eyebrows.

Bolsonaro over suspicion he was plotting to escape and avoid starting a 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup attempt . The decision laid bare some of the country’s divisions, with many uncorking Champagne outside the far-right leader’s prison to celebrate as his supporters prepared a religious act in his favor. In a dramatic and unexpected twist in the final stage of a long and divisive criminal trial, federal agents entered Bolsonaro’s house early Saturday under the order of a Supreme Court Justice to take the former president to the headquarters of the country’s federal police in the capital, Brasilia. Justice Alexandre de Moraes , who oversaw the case on Bolsonaro’s attempt to keep the presidency after his defeat to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022, ordered the preemptive arrest after saying the far-right leader’s ankle monitor was violated at 12:08 a.m. on Saturday. His lawyers claimed in a statement that did not take place.

In a court video also seen by the AP, Bolsonaro is heard admitting such attempt. The footage shows the ankle monitor’s cap heavily damaged.

His aide Andriely Cirino confirmed that the arrest took place around 6 a.m. on Saturday. In the following hours, dozens of cars honked outside the federal police’s headquarters as some Bolsonaro supporters protested. Police have since tried keep the small, but fierce, opposing sides separated. A protest organized by Bolsonaro’s son alerted the justice De Moraes said the arrest was a preventive measure to avoid a potential escape during a protest organized by his son later Saturday. “Are you going to fight for your country or are you going to watch it all from your cellphone in your home’s sofa?,” Flávio Bolsonaro said in a video inviting people to go outside his fathers’ house at 7 p.m. “I invite you to fight with us.” De Moraes said the attempt to break the ankle monitor was a confirmation Bolsonaro would try to escape during “the confusion that would be caused by a demonstration organized by his son.” The judge said there was a chance of Bolsonaro fleeing to the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia. The Supreme Court justice also mentioned other defendants in the coup case and political allies of the former president leaving Brazil to avoid jail. “He is located about 13 kilometers (8 miles) away from where the United States of America embassy lies, in a distance that can be covered in a 15-minute drive,” said de Moraes, who has been sanctioned by the Trump administration. In August, Brazil’s federal police found messages that linked Bolsonaro to a political asylum request to Argentina, where an ally of his, Javier Milei, is president. Trump was asked outside the White House on Saturday about Bolsonaro’s arrest, but said that was the first he was hearing of it. “Is that what happened? That’s too bad,” he said. Pressed for further comment, he said: “I just think it’s too bad.” Trump also said he’d spoken with Lula on Friday night and that the two might be meeting “in the very near future.” Bolsonaro’s lawyers said in a statement that the former president’s arrest “causes deep perplexity because, as (de Moraes’) chronology of facts shows, it is based in a vigil for prayer,” not a protest. The preemptive arrest of Bolsonaro, who is an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, will be discussed and voted on Monday by the five-justice Supreme Court panel that both convicted and sentenced him to prison by 4 votes to 1 in September.

Few protesters were outside the federal police headquarters in Brasilia as of Saturday morning, with more expected later as organizers of the vigil mentioned by Bolsonaro’s lawyers say they will move it to where the former president is jailed. Detractors of the former president were celebrating online and scheduling parties later in the day in major Brazilian cities. “The video shot by Flávio Bolsonaro stimulates the disrespect to the constitutional text, to the judicial decision and to (democratic) institutions, showing there’s no limits for the criminal organization in its attempt to create chaos and conflict in this country, in a total disrespect to democracy,” de Moraes wrote in his ruling. Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil’s democracy following his 2022 election defeat. Prosecutors said the coup plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. Bolsonaro was also found guilty on charges of leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. He denies any wrongdoing. Bolsonaro’s allies vow to defend him Fabio Wajngarten, Bolsonaro’s former press adviser and lawyer, said the arrest of the former president was “a terrible stain on the institutions.” Speaking in a video posted on X, Wajngarten added: “It’s a shame. I hope this is reviewed soon.” He claimed Bolsonaro’s ankle monitoring device was working perfectly as of Saturday morning. “How could something that was broken, violated, be functioning normally nine hours later?” he wrote. “The president had dinner — a soup — yesterday with four brothers and brothers-in-law, took medication for hiccups, felt drowsy and laid down around 10 p.m. None of his sons were at the house.” Sóstenes Cavalcante, Bolsonaro’s party whip in the lower house, accused de Moraes of showing “psychopathy at the highest level.” “We will always stand by your side. Stay strong,” he said in a video shared with the AP. “We will respond appropriately.” In an Instagram post, Michelle Bolsonaro, the former first lady, vowed Bolsonaro’s supporters “will not give up on our nation.” She was outside Brasilia when her husband was arrested at home. Lula is in South Africa for a summit of the G20 group of industrialized and emerging-market nations. Gleisi Hoffmann, one of his top ministers, said on her social media channels that Bolsonaro’s arrest comes after “violent attempts of coersion” of Supreme Court justices by the former president.

His lawyers were pleading with Brazil’s Supreme Court to keep him at home to serve his sentence, citing his poor health, but Brazilian law requires that all convicts start their sentences in prison. Creomar de Souza, a political analyst with Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said the move by de Moraes will impact next year’s presidential election, with Lula seeking reelection and Bolsonaro already barred from running. “They had the idea of turning the 2026 election into a referendum on Bolsonaro. And for that to happen they needed actions, they needed to build an optics of Bolsonaro as a martyr and an impactful popular leader,” de Souza told the AP. “At the end of the day, this shows the Bolsonaro family they will need to build their own alternative for the 2026 elections.” ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo.

Maria Cantwell on Friday demanded answers from BP about a leak that has forced the shutdown of a major Pacific Northwest fuel pipeline, threatening the fuel supply for jets at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as well as a possible increase in gasoline prices heading into a busy Thanksgiving travel weekend. The 400-mile-long (644-kilometer-long) Olympic Pipeline is the backbone of the region’s system for moving gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum products from refineries near the Canadian border to distribution terminals in the Pacific Northwest west of the Cascades, including major population centers in Washington and Oregon. The pipeline system has been shut down since Monday, following intermittent shutoffs after a leak was discovered near Everett, north of Seattle, on Nov. 11. Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson declared an emergency earlier this week, waiving some safety restrictions on truck drivers to allow more jet fuel to be hauled to the airport by road, and his office said Friday that measure was working to help more fuel reach the airport. Cantwell noted that it takes 90 trucks per day to deliver half the fuel the airport uses. Major air carriers said Friday the shutdown has not so far disrupted travel at the airport, which is expected to see some 900,000 travelers over the Thanksgiving holiday, according to Cantwell.

Follow on BP said in a written statement that response crews have been excavating two pipelines along the Snohomish River and there is no timeline for restarting them. “The safety of personnel, the environment, and the community remain our highest priority,” BP spokesperson Christina Audisho wrote. Alaska Airlines said it was preparing contingency plans in case the shutdown begins to affect operations, including having flights arrive at Sea-Tac with extra fuel so that they don’t need to top up at the airport. Portland International Airport does not anticipate any problems because it can bring jet fuel in by barge, unlike Seattle’s airport, officials said. It remains unclear how much fuel has spilled. Cleanup efforts include deploying vacuum trucks and removing contaminated soil, Washington Department of Ecology spokesperson Jasmin Adams said in an email. Neither BP nor state officials have reported any contamination in the nearby river. Among the questions Cantwell insisted that BP address was what caused the leak, what BP was doing to mitigate it, when the pipeline was last inspected in the area and what effect the shutdown would have on regional gas prices. Previous shutdowns of the pipeline have prompted gas prices to spike in Washington and Oregon. The pipeline has a lengthy history of leaks, including a 1999 fireball that killed three young people recreating along a creek in Bellingham, Washington. The accident led to an overhaul of federal pipeline regulation. In 2023 , a spill near Conway, north of Seattle, sent around 25,000 gallons (95,000 liters) of gasoline into nearby streams that support salmon and other wildlife. Kenneth Clarkson, spokesperson for the Pipeline Safety Trust, a pipeline safety education and lobbying organization founded after the Bellingham explosion, noted in an email Friday that equipment failure has been the cause of 21 Olympic Pipeline spills since 1999. “These incidents have caused over $100 million in property damage,” Clarkson wrote. “Olympic Pipeline must explain what has changed and what they’re doing to stop it.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/air-traffic-suspended-at-netherlands-airport-after-drone-sightings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"22:03:37+00:00","title":"Air traffic suspended at Netherlands airport after drone sightings","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Air traffic at Eindhoven Airport in the Netherlands was suspended for several hours due to multiple drone sightings, prompting the Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans to confirm security measures were taken.

persist\n\nUnited Nations climate talks in Brazil have gone past their scheduled deadline as countries remain  deeply divided  over a proposed deal that contains no reference to phasing out fossil fuels.\n\nNegotiators remained in closed-door meetings on Friday evening at  the COP30 summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem as they sought to bridge differences and deliver an agreement that includes concrete action to stem the climate crisis.\n\nA draft proposal made public earlier in the day has drawn concern from climate activists and other experts because it did not contain any mention of fossil fuels – the main driver of climate change.\n\n“This cannot be an agenda that divides us,” COP30 President Andre Correa do Lago told delegates in a public plenary session before releasing them for further negotiations. “We must reach an agreement between us.”\n\nThe rift over the future of oil, gas and coal has underscored the difficulties of landing a consensus agreement at the  annual UN conference , which serves as a test of global resolve to avert the worst impacts of global warming.\n\n“Many countries, especially oil-producing countries or countries that depend on fossil fuels … have stated that they do not want this mentioned in a final agreement,” Al Jazeera’s Monica Yanakiew reported from Rio de Janeiro on Friday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other countries have said they would not support any agreement that did not lay out a roadmap to phasing out fossil fuels, Yanakiew noted.\n\n“So this is a big divisive point,” she said, adding that another major issue at the climate conference has been  financing the transition  away from fossil fuels.\n\nDeveloping countries – many of which are more susceptible to the effects of climate change, including more extreme weather events – have said they want richer nations to shoulder more of the financial burden of tackling the crisis.\n\n“So there is a lot being discussed … and negotiators say that this might likely continue throughout the weekend,” Yanakiew said.\n\nThe deadlock comes as the UN Environment Programme  warned ahead of COP30  that the world would “very likely” exceed the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7-degree Fahrenheit) warming limit – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – within the next decade.\n\nAmnesty International also  said in a recent report  that the expansion of fossil fuel projects threatens at least two billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Nafkote Dabi, the climate policy lead at Oxfam International, said it was “unacceptable” for any final agreement to exclude a plan to phase out fossil fuels.\n\n“A roadmap is essential, and it must be just, equitable, and backed by real support for the Global South,” Dabi said.\n\n“Developed countries who grew wealthy on their fossil fuel-based economies must phase out first and fastest, while financing low‑carbon pathways for the Global South.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar

know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/brazils-bolsonaro-arrested-days-before-start-of-27-year-prison-sentence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"12:15:13+00:00","title":"Brazil’s Bolsonaro arrested as flight risk days before start of prison term","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil’s Supreme Court has ordered the preemptive arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro, citing evidence of intent to escape just days before he was set to begin a 27-year prison sentence for allegedly leading a failed coup attempt in 2022.

that found Texas’ 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump likely discriminates on the basis of race. The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections. The court’s conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections. The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections. The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas. Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump’s efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year’s elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case.

Texas was the first state to meet Trump’s demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state’s new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there. The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina. The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It’s not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/countries-sharply-split-on-fossil-fuels-on-cop30-climate-summit-final-day","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:21:45+00:00","title":"Countries sharply split on fossil fuels on COP30 climate summit final day","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the final day of the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, countries remain deeply divided over the future of fossil fuels, with Brazil’s new draft proposal omitting any mention of fossil fuels or a transition roadmap.

Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, is slated to end in Brazil’s northern city of Belem, potentially in a haze of recriminations.\n\nDelegates at the two-week conference have failed to reach a deal as Brazil circulated a new draft proposal on Thursday that did not include a roadmap to transitioning away from fossil fuels – nor mention the term “fossil fuels” at all.\n\nMore than 30 other countries from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Pacific co-signed a letter in response, slamming the draft and saying they “cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly and equitable transition” from nonrenewable energy sources.\n\nThe commitment to moving away from fossil fuels – including natural gas, coal and crude oil –  was considered a landmark achievement of COP28 in Dubai . Even then, the deal stopped short of calling for a “phase-out” amid fierce lobbying from oil-producing countries.\n\nA first draft of the COP30 text, which was publicised on Tuesday, did contain the option of building a roadmap away from such fuels.\n\nBut major producers and consumers, including China, India, Saudi Arabia and Russia, rejected the proposal, several news outlets reported, quoting negotiators familiar with discussions.\n\nThe United States – which backed a phase-out in 2023 under former President Joe Biden – did not send a delegation to this year’s conference.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has long slammed the climate crisis and global warming as a “hoax.”\n\nAnother point of contention is climate finance, meaning money to help countries adapt to climate change. Brazil’s newest draft calls for tripling climate financing by 2030 compared with 2025 levels.\n\nBut it left unclear who exactly would provide the financing, whether it be wealthy states, the private sector or multilateral development banks. Western countries have historically baulked at providing cash to poorer nations dealing with the worst climate change effects.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the conference was “down to the wire” and urged countries to “address disinformation aimed at derailing the transition”.\n\n“Communities on the front lines are watching too, counting flooded homes, failed harvests, lost livelihoods,” he added. “They have heard enough excuses.”\n\nThe languishing negotiations were meanwhile interrupted on Thursday by a fire that forced thousands of delegates to evacuate the conference.\n\nFlames erupted  in an exhibition pavilion and rapidly spread up the building’s internal shell as attendees finished lunch, lasting about six minutes.\n\nNineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation, but no injuries were reported, according to event and fire officials.\n\nDelegates have reported various problems with electrical wiring, air conditioning and infrastructure throughout COP30, which is taking place at the edge of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThousands of protesters have also  marched in Belem  to call for Indigenous people and environmental defenders to be heard.\n\nIn a joint statement on Thursday evening, the UN and COP30 leaders said the fire site was “safe” and shifted the focus back to the negotiations, which may spill into the weekend.\n\n“We still have substantial work ahead, and we trust that delegates will return to the negotiations in a spirit of solidarity and determination to ensure a successful outcome for this COP,” the statement said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/epstein-victims-expect-death-threats-to-rise-as-us-release-of-files-nears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"08:27:07+00:00","title":"Epstein victims expect death threats to rise as US release of files nears","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. Justice Department nears the release of files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein, survivors are warning of a rise in death threats and fear of institutional suppression.

Epstein victims expect death threats to rise as US release of files nears\n\nA group of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse have said that they have been receiving death threats, which they expect to escalate, as the date nears for the release of  files  concerning the deceased convicted paedophile financier.\n\nIn a statement titled “What we’re bracing for” and made public on Thursday, Epstein’s survivors have demanded accountability and legal support to face their abusers and get justice.\n\n“Many of us have already received death threats and other threats of harm. We are bracing for these to escalate,” they said.\n\n“We ask every federal and state law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over these threats to investigate them and protect us.”\n\nThey also warned that there have been attempts to blame the victims for their own or each other’s abuse.\n\nSome of the survivors have increased the pace of their campaigning efforts recently to pressure the United States administration to release the Justice Department’s files on the late sex offender, speaking publicly about their stories.\n\nThe furore has dominated the national agenda in the US with President Donald Trump backpedalling on his opposition against the Justice Department releasing the files with a sudden about-face last week.\n\nTrump  signed  a bill on Wednesday requiring the Justice Department to release all of the files related to the disgraced financier.\n\nThat was one day after the legislation was unanimously approved in the US Senate.\n\nAfter he signed the move into law, the department has  30 days  to make them public.\n\nThe development follows weeks of intense political fighting about how far to go in disclosing records tied to Epstein.\n\nThe release could identify some of the most high-profile figures in politics, entertainment and business.\n\n“Years ago, Epstein got away with abusing us by portraying us as flawed and bad girls,” said the statement by the survivors, demanding full disclosure of the files.\n\n“We cannot let his enablers use this tactic to escape accountability now,” added the appeal, signed by 18 named survivors and 10 Jane Does.\n\n“We ask our champions in Congress and in the public to continue fighting to make sure all materials are released, not selected ones.”\n\nFor one survivor, Marina Lacerda, the upcoming publication of the files represents more than an opportunity for justice.\n\nLacerda says she was just 14 when Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York mansion, but she struggles to recall much of what happened because it is such a dark period in her life. Now, she’s hoping that the files will reveal more about the trauma that distorted so much of her adolescence.\n\n“I feel that the government and the FBI knows more than I do, and that scares me, because it’s my life, it’s my past,” she told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. He pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 of procuring a minor for prostitution.\n\nVirginia Giuffre, an Epstein survivor whose painful story has been one of the most high-profile cases, had reportedly faced a campaign of intimidation and threats before she  died by suicide  in April.\n\nGiuffre had accused Epstein and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the disgraced and expelled former United Kingdom royal  Prince Andrew , of sexual abuse."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/cop30-draft-text-urges-more-funds-for-poorer-countries-omits-fossil-fuels","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"16:18:31+00:00","title":"COP30 deal urges more funds for poorer countries, omits fossil fuels","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, world leaders reached a deal to triple climate finance for developing nations and call for global action to keep global warming within the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Agreement.

poorer countries, omits fossil fuels\n\nWorld leaders have agreed to a deal at the United Nations climate conference in Brazil that seeks to address the crisis, but the agreement does not include any mention of phasing out the fossil fuels driving climate change.\n\nThe text was approved on Saturday afternoon after negotiations  stretched through the night , well beyond the expected close of the two-week COP30 summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, amid deep divisions over the fossil fuel phase-out.\n\nThe agreement pledges to review climate-related trade barriers and calls on developed nations to “at least triple” the money given to developing countries to help them withstand extreme weather events.\n\nIt also urges “all actors to work together to significantly accelerate and scale up climate action worldwide” with the aim of keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) mark for global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “within reach”.\n\nWopke Hoekstra, the European Union’s climate commissioner, said the outcome was a step in the right direction, but the bloc would have liked more.\n\n“We’re not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything,” Hoekstra told reporters. “We should support it because at least it is going in the right direction,” he said.\n\nFrance’s ecological transition minister, Monique Barbut, also said it was a “rather flat text” but Europeans would not oppose it because “there is nothing extraordinarily bad in it”.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla also said in  a social media post  that while the outcome “fell short of expectations”, COP30 demonstrated the importance of multilateralism to tackle global challenges such as climate change.\n\nCountries had  been divided  on a number of issues in Belem, including a push to phase out fossil fuels – the largest drivers of the climate crisis – that drew opposition from oil-producing countries and nations that depend on oil, gas and coal.\n\nQuestions of  climate finance  also sparked heated debates, with developing nations demanding that richer countries bear a greater share of the financial burden.\n\nBut COP30 host Brazil had pushed for a show of unity, as the annual conference is largely viewed as a test of the world’s resolve to address a deepening crisis.\n\n“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  said earlier this week .\n\nSpeaking during Saturday afternoon’s closing session in Belem, COP30 President Andre Aranha Correa do Lago acknowledged that several countries as well as civil society groups “had greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand”.\n\n“As President Lula said at the opening of this COP, we need roadmaps so that humanity – in a just and planned manner – can overcome its dependence on fossil fuels, halt and  reverse deforestation  and mobilise resources for these purposes,” Correa do Lago said.\n\n“I, as president of COP30, will therefore create two roadmaps: One on halting and reverting [reversing] deforestation and another to transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner,” he said, spurring a round of applause from delegates.\n\nCorrea do Lago also added that the first international conference on the phase-out of fossil fuels is scheduled to take place in Colombia in April.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera before the draft text was released, Asad Rehman, chief executive director of Friends of the Earth, said  richer countries  “had to be dragged – really kicking and screaming – to the table” at COP30.\n\n“They have tried to bully developing countries and have weakened the text … But I would say that, overall, from what we’re hearing, we will have taken a step forward,” Rehman said in an interview from Belem.\n\n“This will be welcomed by the millions of people for whom these talks are a matter of life and death. However, in the scale of  the crisis that we face , we of course needed a giant leap forward.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/indian-trade-unions-oppose-new-labour-codes-call-for-demonstrations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"19:38:53+00:00","title":"Indian trade unions oppose new labour codes, call for demonstrations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ten major Indian trade unions, including the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, have strongly opposed the government's new labour codes, calling them a 'deceptive fraud' and demanding their withdrawal ahead of nationwide protests.

leaders, rights groups react to COP30 climate deal\n\nThe annual United Nations climate conference has ended with  an agreement  that urges action to address global warming, but falls short of endorsing a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nAfter two weeks of heated debates, meetings and negotiations at the COP30 summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, world leaders on Saturday agreed to a deal that calls for countries to “significantly accelerate and scale up climate action worldwide”.\n\nThe text lays out a series of promises and measures – including a call for developed countries to triple their funding to help poorer nations respond to the crisis – but makes no mention of a fossil fuel phase-out.\n\nDozens of states had been calling forthe COP30 deal to lay out a framework to ease away from their  reliance on oil, gas and coal  – the major drivers of the climate crisis – but several countries that rely on fossil fuels had pushed back.\n\nWhile observers say the deal marks a step forward in the world’s effort to address climate breakdown, several have argued that COP30 fell short of expectations.\n\nHere’s a look at how some world leaders and climate advocates have reacted to the agreement.\n\n“We know some of you had greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand. I know that you, civil society, will demand us to do more to fight climate change. I want to reaffirm that I will try not to disappoint you during my presidency,” he said during Saturday’s closing session.\n\n“As [Brazilian]  President  [Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] said at the opening of this COP, we need roadmaps so that humanity – in a just and planned manner – can overcome its dependence on fossil fuels, halt and reverse deforestation and mobilise resources for these purposes,” he said.\n\n“I, as president of COP30, will therefore create two roadmaps: One on halting and reverting [reversing] deforestation and another to transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner.”\n\n“COP30 has delivered progress,” Guterres said in  a statement , including the call to triple climate adaptation financing and recognition that the world is going to surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target for global warming set under the Paris Agreement.\n\n“But COPs are consensus-based – and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach. I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide,” the UN chief said.\n\n“I understand many may feel dissapointed [sic] – especially young people, Indigenous Peoples and those living through climate chaos. The reality of overshoot is a stark warning: We are approaching dangerous and irreversible tipping points,” he added.\n\n“We’re not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything,” Hoekstra told reporters.\n\n“It is not perfect, but it is a hugely important step in the right direction.”\n\n“I do not accept that the COP30 declaration does not clearly state, as science does, that the cause of the climate crisis is the fossil fuels used by capital. If that is not stated, everything else is hypocrisy,” Petro wrote on  social media .\n\n“Life on the planet, including our own, is only possible if we separate ourselves from oil, coal, and natural gas as energy sources; science has determined this, and I am not blind to science.\n\n“Colombia opposes a COP30 declaration that does not tell the world the scientific truth.”\n\n“While the results fell short of expectations, the Belem COP strengthens and demonstrates the importance of multilateralism in addressing major global challenges such as combating #climatechange,” he wrote on X.\n\n“Among its key outcomes are the call for developed countries to provide climate finance for adaptation in developing countries, at least tripling current levels by 2035; the establishment of a mechanism to support our countries in just transitions; and the commitment from developed countries to fulfill their obligations under the Paris Agreement.”\n\n“I’m happy with the outcome,” Li Gao, head of China’s delegation at COP30, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We achieved this success in a very difficult situation, so it shows that the international community would like to show solidarity and make joint efforts to address climate change.”\n\nA group representing the interests of 39 small island and low-lying coastal states described the deal as “imperfect” but said it nevertheless was a step towards “progress”.\n\n“Ultimately, this is the push and pull of multilateralism. The opportunity for all countries to be heard and to listen to each other’s perspectives, to collaborate, build bridges, and reach common ground,” the Alliance of Small Island States said in a statement.\n\nAnn Harrison, climate justice adviser at Amnesty International, noted that COP30 host Brazil had promised to make sure “every voice is heard and made strenuous efforts to  broaden participation , which should be replicated”.\n\n“Yet the lack of participatory, inclusive, and transparent negotiations left both civil society and Indigenous Peoples, who answered the global mutirao [working together] call in large numbers, out of the real decision making,” Harrison said in a statement.\n\nStill, she said “people power” had helped achieve “a commitment to develop a Just Transition mechanism that will streamline and coordinate ongoing and future efforts to protect the rights of workers, other individuals and communities affected by fossil fuel phase out”.\n\nViviana Santiago, executive director of Oxfam Brasil, said COP30 “offered a spark of hope but far more heartbreak, as the ambition of global leaders continues to fall short of what is needed for a liveable planet”.\n\n“A truly just transition requires those who built their fortunes on fossil fuels to move first and fastest – and provide finance in the form of grants, not loans, so front-line communities can do the same. Instead, the poorest countries already in debt are being told to transition faster, with fewer funds,” Santiago said.\n\n“The spark of hope lies in the proposed Belem Action Mechanism, which puts workers’ rights and justice at the centre of the shift away from fossil fuels. But without financing from rich countries, the just energy transition risks becoming stalled in many countries.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/russia-claims-more-land-in-ukraine-as-us-pushes-its-plan-eu-uk-regroup","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"15:23:10+00:00","title":"Ukraine’s allies say more work needed on US plan to end Russia’s war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian and US officials are set to meet in Geneva to discuss the US-proposed 28-point peace plan aimed at ending the war with Russia.

allies said the proposal needs more work.\n\n“In the coming days, consultations will take place with partners regarding the steps needed to end the war,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday on X, after he issued a decree stating Ukraine’s team for the talks, which will be led by his top aide, Andriy Yermak.\n\n“Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests and what is necessary to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion,” Zelenskyy added.\n\nUS President Donald Trump gave Ukraine until Thursday to approve the 28-point plan to end the nearly four-year war, which would see the invaded country cede territory, cut its army, and pledge to never join NATO.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, Trump said the current US proposal was not a final offer. “The war needs to

But he said “no” when asked if this was his final offer.\n\nIn the coming days, consultations with our partners will take place on the steps needed to end the war.

He previously led a few rounds of negotiations with Russia in Turkiye, which only yielded prisoner exchanges and the repatriations of bodies.\n\nZelenskyy’s decree also said the negotiations will include “representatives of the Russian Federation”. There was no immediate confirmation from Russia whether it would join the talks.\n\nEuropean and other Western leaders said they believe the plan was a basis for talks to end Russia’s war but required “additional work”.\n\n“We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said the leaders of key European countries, as well as Canada and Japan, in a joint statement.\n\n“We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,” they said, adding that any implementing elements of the plan linked with the 27-member bloc and NATO would have to be undertaken with the consent of member states.\n\nGerman Chancellor Merz said Russia’s war could only be ended with Ukraine’s “unconditional consent”.\n\n“Wars cannot be ended by major powers over the heads of the countries affected,” he said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nLater on Saturday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke by phone to Zelenskyy, followed by a call with Trump, a British government spokesperson.\n\nStarmer reiterated Britain’s “steadfast support for Ukraine” in his conversation with Zelenskyy and agreed with Trump that British and US teams would work together on the US peace plan for Ukraine in Geneva, the spokesperson said.\n\nRussia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with the state-owned International Affairs magazine, published on Saturday, that he would not rule out the possibility of another meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has  backed the US proposal .\n\n“The search for a way forward continues,” he said, adding that Moscow and Washington continue to keep channels for dialogue open despite the lack of an agreement during a Trump-Putin meeting in August, and the indefinite suspension of another planned round in Budapest.\n\nPutin has refused to engage in a summit that includes Zelenskyy and will be even less likely to now, given he believes Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield and the ear of the US on the diplomatic front.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces continue to report advances in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence announced on Saturday that its soldiers “liberated” the settlement of Zvanivka in the Donetsk region’s Bakhmut, allegedly inflicting “significant losses” on Ukrainian forces.\n\nIt also released footage of air attacks and FPV drone attacks on Ukrainian positions in the Zaporizhia region, where Russian forces have been  getting closer to the strategic town of Huliaipole  using glide bombs and tactical ground incursions.\n\nThe Defence Ministry claimed that the Novoe Zaporozhye area was taken under Russian control, including a “major enemy defence node” covering an area of more than 14sq km (five square miles).\n\nThis would add to a growing number of villages in the southeastern Ukrainian region that have been captured by Russian troops since September as they try to push back the Ukrainian military and  strike energy infrastructure  with another punishing winter of war approaching.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are also under intense attacks in the Pokrovsk area, where the fighting is believed to be fierce as the Russian military command redeploys forces to strengthen its offensive.\n\nRegional Ukrainian authorities have reported at least one civilian death and 13 injuries over the past day as a result of Russian air attacks. The fatal strike took place in Donetsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said Russian troops launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile from annexed Crimea and 104 drones from several areas towards multiple Ukrainian regions overnight into Saturday, of which 89 drones were downed. Most of the drones were of Iranian design, it added.\n\nUkrainian media said the Yany Kapu electric substation in northern Crimea was targeted by drones overnight, with footage circulating on social media showing explosions and strikes.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said its air force shot down six fixed-wing Ukrainian drones over Crimea early on Saturday, without confirming any hits on the ground."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/young-man-documents-gazas-untold-stories-of-israels-genocide-in-book","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"09:05:56+00:00","title":"Young man documents Gaza’s untold stories of Israel’s genocide in book","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wasim Said, a 24-year-old Palestinian man displaced by the ongoing Israeli military campaign in Gaza, is writing a book titled 'Witness to the Hellfire of Genocide' to preserve the untold stories of human suffering.

young displaced man is writing a book to express acute Palestinian suffering and tell human stories that would otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nWasim Said’s book, Witness to the Hellfire of Genocide, chronicles two years of unrelenting war, as well as  repeated forced displacement  as a result of the relentless Israeli bombardment, ground invasion, destruction and forced starvation.\n\nThe 24-year-old shared his story with Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, describing how he mostly writes inside a tent with nothing in it, including no real protection from the scorching heat in summer or the  freezing winter cold and heavy rains .\n\n“Displacement sites and tents have become part of our lives. We’ve had to find ways to adapt to this misery – even though it’s almost impossible,” he said.\n\nEvery chapter in Said’s book is named after a person, a place, or a memory he refuses to let disappear.\n\n“I don’t need your sympathy,” he said. “I need a conscience that hasn’t rotted … a human that hasn’t turned to stone, I need a reader who won’t just close the book and sigh – then go to sip their coffee.”\n\nHe has spent many nights writing by candlelight because the Israeli military has destroyed nearly all of the infrastructure in Gaza, so  there is no electricity or internet  for the displaced population.\n\nSaid said he did not write for recognition, but to express his emotions and bear witness to the atrocities.\n\n“I was devastated. I couldn’t contain my anger. Writing became the only way to let it out,” he said.\n\nHe began by writing about his experiences, but soon realised that there were many who had gone through even more horrific tragedies that he said the human mind cannot imagine.\n\n“People who were killed and buried without anyone knowing. Their final moments. Their fear. I called this chapter The Untold Stories.”\n\nFor Said, every page is a form of quiet resistance against forgetting. He said death felt “inevitable” in many instances.\n\n“I wrote because I wanted to leave something behind – to be a witness, not just another martyr. Stories disappear if they’re not documented,” he said.\n\nWith nearly 70,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since October 2023 and countless hospitals, schools and homes lying in ruins, the young man said he has questioned the point of writing, or indeed the point of being alive.\n\n“But human nature looks for a glimmer of hope.

urges US to intervene\n\nIsrael’s military has launched a wave of air attacks across Gaza, killing at least 24 Palestinians, including children, in its latest violation of a six-week old ceasefire in the war-torn territory.\n\nThe attacks on Saturday also wounded 87 others, according to authorities in Gaza.\n\nWitnesses said the first strike hit a car in northern Gaza City, and was followed by more attacks in central Deir el-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nThe drone attack in Gaza City killed at least 11 people and wounded 20 others, according to the managing director of al-Shifa Hospital, Rami Mhanna. It happened in the city’s Remal neighbourhood.\n\nIn Deir el-Balah, at least three people, including a woman, were killed when an Israeli strike hit a house there.\n\nKhalil Abu Hatab, a witness, said the attack caused a “powerful explosion”.\n\n“I looked outside and saw smoke covering the entire area. I couldn’t see a thing. I covered my ears and started shouting to the others in the tent to run,” he said.\n\n“When I looked again, I realised the upper floor of my neighbour’s house was gone. It’s a fragile ceasefire. This is not a life we can live. There’s no safe place.”\n\nThe Israeli attack on Nuseirat also hit a residential building.\n\nAnas al-Saloul, who witnessed the attack, said he was sitting in his home when a missile suddenly hit his neighbour’s house.\n\n“We took the injured and came to the hospital,” he said. “There were injuries and deaths, and everyone in the street was covered in debris,” he added.\n\nAccording to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israel has violated the United States-brokered ceasefire at least 497 times since it came into effect on October 10.\n\nSome 342 civilians have been killed in the attacks, with  children , women and the elderly accounting for the majority of the victims.\n\n“We condemn in the strongest terms the continued serious and systematic violations of the ceasefire agreement by the Israeli occupation authorities,” the office said in a statement.\n\n“These violations constitute a flagrant breach of international humanitarian law and the humanitarian protocol attached to the agreement. Among these violations, 27 occurred today, Saturday, resulting in 24 martyrs and 87 wounded,” it added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it launched the attacks after a Hamas fighter attacked Israeli soldiers in Israeli-held territory.\n\n“In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas [fighters],” it said in a statement.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas on the slain fighters.\n\nEarlier in the day, as the attacks unfolded, the Palestinian group accused Israel of violating the truce “under fabricated pretexts” and called on mediators – the US, Egypt and Qatar – to intervene immediately.\n\nIt also said Israel has pushed westward  beyond the yellow line , where Israeli troops are stationed in Gaza, and is changing the boundary set out as part of the deal.\n\n“We call upon the mediators to intervene urgently and exert pressure to immediately halt these violations,” the Palestinian group said in a statement. “We also demand that the US administration fulfil its commitments and compel [Israel] to implement its obligations, and to confront its attempts to undermine the ceasefire in Gaza.”\n\nA senior official also dismissed reports in Saudi Arabia-owned Al Arabiya that claimed it had called off the ceasefire.\n\n“Israel is fabricating pretexts to evade the agreement and return to the war of annihilation, while it is the one violating the agreement daily and systematically,” Izzat al-Risheq, member of the Hamas political bureau, told Quds News Network.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said the latest attacks were traumatising for Palestinians.\n\n“This is a reminder that the ceasefire is quite fragile, and in fact, [the] violence never ended at all,” he said. “What was going at a very fast pace in the past few years has now turned into this slow and steady pattern of killing,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, more Israeli military and settler violence was reported on Saturday in the occupied West Bank amid what the United Nations has described as a  record-breaking surge  in attacks on Palestinians.\n\nThe Palestinian news agency Wafa said Israeli settlers assaulted Palestinian farmers southeast of Masafer Yatta, in the West Bank’s South Hebron Hills area.\n\nSeparately, Wafa said Israeli soldiers also wounded two Palestinians during a raid in Dura, a town south of Hebron.\n\nIsraeli attacks in the West Bank have increased in the shadow of Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 70,000 Palestinians in the coastal enclave since October 2023.\n\nThey also come as members of Israel’s far-right government push to  formally annex the territory .\n\nLast week, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that 260 Israeli settler attacks were recorded in October – more than in any month since 2006.\n\n“The surge in violence comes as Israeli authorities have ramped up home demolitions, the seizure of property, arrests, and movement restrictions, alongside the unabated building of settlements and outposts and the forcible displacement and transfer of thousands of Palestinians by Israeli settlers and the military,” Thameen al-Kheetan said in  a statement .\n\n“Permanently displacing the Palestinian population within occupied territory amounts to unlawful transfer, which is a war crime. The transfer by Israel of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies also amounts to a war crime.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/south-africa-seeks-to-prioritise-developing-world-at-historic-g20-summit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"10:04:56+00:00","title":"Historic South Africa G20 summit declaration prioritises developing world","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The historic first G20 summit on African soil in South Africa, hosted under President Cyril Ramaphosa, issued a declaration prioritizing peace in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the occupied Palestinian territories, and Ukraine, while emphasizing climate change, debt relief, and inclusive growth.

South Africa G20 summit declaration prioritises developing world\n\nThe final document of the Group of 20 summit in South Africa says the organisation will work towards the settlement of armed conflicts and lighten the burden of the developing nations in the world.\n\nThe summit, the first G20 gathering on the African continent, convened on Saturday for the first of two days with an ambitious  agenda  to make progress on solving some of the longstanding problems that have afflicted the world’s poorest nations despite a boycott by the United States.\n\nLeaders and top government officials from the richest and leading emerging economies came together at an exhibition centre near the famous Soweto township in South Africa, once home to iconic post-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, to try to find some consensus on the priorities set out by the host country.\n\nThe adopted summit declaration said the organisation will work for a comprehensive and lasting peace in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the occupied Palestinian territory and Ukraine.\n\nThe declaration placed pointed emphasis on the seriousness of climate change, in a snub to US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly cast aspersions and doubts on the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities.\n\nIt stressed that increasing large-scale disasters disproportionately affect people in vulnerable situations in ways that exacerbate poverty and inequality, adding that a high level of debt is one of the obstacles to inclusive growth in many developing economies.\n\n“We are committed to strengthen the implementation of the G20 common framework for debt treatments in a predictable, timely, orderly, and coordinated manner,” the declaration said.\n\n“Critical minerals should become a catalyst for value-addition and broad-based development, rather than just raw material exports,” it added.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said in his opening remarks that South Africa sought to preserve the integrity and stature of the G20 top economies, but is also committed to ensuring that the development priorities of the Global South and Africa find expression in the group’s agenda.\n\nThe US, which is boycotting the summit, had demanded that no declaration be made. Ramaphosa flatly rejected that.\n\nMany of South Africa’s priorities for the group, including a focus on climate change and its impact on developing countries, have met resistance from the US.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said before the summit: “But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.”\n\nGuterres cautioned that rich nations have often failed to make the concessions required to strike effective climate or global financial reform agreements.\n\nTrump  ordered  his country to boycott the summit over his baseless claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made clear its opposition to South Africa’s G20 agenda from the start of the year, when it began hosting G20 meetings.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in February, slamming the agenda as being all about diversity, equity and inclusion, and climate change.\n\nRubio dismissively said he would not waste American taxpayers’ money on that.\n\nThe months-long diplomatic rift between the US and South Africa deepened in the build-up to the main summit this weekend, but while Trump’s boycott dominated the pre-talks discussions in Johannesburg and threatened to undercut the agenda, some leaders were eager to move on.\n\n“I do regret it,” French President Emmanuel Macron said of Trump’s absence.\n\n“But it should not block us. Our duty is to be present, engage and work all together because we have so many challenges.”\n\nThe G20 is actually a group of 21 members that includes 19 nations, the European Union, and the African Union.\n\nThe bloc was formed in 1999 as a bridge between rich and poor nations to confront global financial crises. While it often operates in the shadow of the Group of Seven richest democracies, G20 members together represent about 85 percent of the world’s economy, 75 percent of international trade and more than half the global population.\n\nBut it works on consensus rather than any binding resolutions, and that is often hard to come by with the different interests of members like the US, Russia, China, India, Japan, the Western European nations France, Germany and the United Kingdom, and others like Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a diverse range of global developments, including AI-generated music flooding streaming platforms, Australia introducing age-based restrictions on social media for children under 16, geopolitical tensions in tech markets involving Nvidia and the US-China trade war, and concerns over misinformation in public health, such as Trump’s false claim linking Tylenol to autism.

Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to enter our solar system, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

2025-11-07T07:49:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA.

It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e0jnww2e9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-23","timeOfPublication":"00:02:59.976+00:00","title":"We worry more about food say Venezuelans living under threat of US military action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and Venezuela, with US military forces, including the USS Gerald R Ford, deployed in the Caribbean and threats of airstrikes and intervention, ordinary Venezuelans are more preoccupied with daily survival.

Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay.\n\n\"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive.\n\nIn the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country, according to the Reuters and AFP news agencies, after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".\n\nThis comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people.\n\nIt's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office.\n\nAlejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas.\n\nHe's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nA Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed.\n\nThe common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bolívar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.\n\nA kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket.\n\nConsuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war.\n\n\"Let whatever happens happen! And that's it!\" she tells the BBC, adding that worrying about the spectre of war doesn't help much.\n\n\"Is it true? Is it false? That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works.\n\n\"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\"\n\nTwo economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals.\n\n\"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out.\n\nThe IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent.\n\nOthers see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it.\n\n\"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail. I used to post things, but not anymore - I shouldn't - because I don't know who might turn me in,\" a merchant from Ciudad Bolívar (in Bolívar state, south) tells the BBC by phone.\n\n\"There's hope, faith, but people are quiet out of fear. You don't hear anyone talking about it; it's just at home, with your family, but there's a hint of joy,\" says the woman anonymously.\n\nMuch of society avoids speaking openly about issues that could be sensitive for Maduro's government, after a wave of arrests followed anti-government protests over the disputed 2024 presidential elections, which have been widely rejected by the international community.\n\nThe opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.\n\nAfter the elections, more than 2,000 people were arrested, official figures show. At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal.\n\nBarbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary. We've been living in absolute misery for years.\n\n\"Venezuelans live day by day waiting for something to happen, but everyone is afraid [to speak] and nobody says anything.\"\n\nEsther Guevara, 53, who works in a medical lab, doesn't hide her concern amid tensions over the US naval fleet deployment.\n\n\"I'm worried because I don't really know what's happening - they might invade, strike… people think it will be ok, but this is serious,\" she says. \"A lot of innocent people could die.\"\n\n\"I feel like something's cooking out there, but I'm waiting,\" she adds.\n\nIt's now midday.\n\nEverything goes on as usual along a busy boulevard in eastern Caracas. Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going.\n\nThere's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean.\n\n\"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\"\n\nStill, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\"\n\nTrump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action.\n\nEither way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20879zzqn8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"20:43:36Z","title":"Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 22 Palestinians, Hamas-run health ministry and civil defence say","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli air strikes across northern and central Gaza, including residential areas in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Nuseirat, killed at least 22 Palestinians, including a senior Hamas commander.

Police say she was murdered.\n\nTwo people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.\n\nRussians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.\n\nChechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.\n\nFor years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.\n\nChechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.\n\nSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.\n\nIn 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.\n\nFormer Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.\n\nBut Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.\n\nLike many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.\n\nAishat arrived in Armenia at the end of 2024 with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.\n\nAt first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.\n\nTo many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"\n\nHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\n\n\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.\n\nHer uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.\n\nOn the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.\n\nPeople who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.\n\nA man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nChechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".\n\nArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\n\n\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.\n\nSince the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.\n\nBut changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.\n\nThat leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.\n\nIn July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.\n\nFor other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.\n\nSeveral have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence.\n\nNow they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\n\n\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\n\n\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\n\n\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20508y7w5yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"00:09:48.213+00:00","title":"G20: Will Trump’s no-show eclipse South Africa’s moment?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Africa, as the first African nation to host the G20, is leveraging its presidency to advance global equity by advocating for cheaper borrowing for developing countries, climate financing, and increased participation in multilateral forums.

that as the first African country to host the gathering of world leaders, it could champion issues that mattered the most to developing nations.\n\nFor instance, it wanted the 20 heads of state from the world's biggest economies to consider arguments that borrowing should be cheaper for developing countries, which pay two to four times more in interest on debts than more advanced economies.\n\nOther themes of this weekend's summit include securing climate change financing, increasing the participation of African countries in multilateral forums and ensuring that they get the best value out of their critical minerals.\n\nBut so far, discourse surrounding the meeting has been dominated by Donald Trump's very public decision not to attend.\n\nThe US president said he would not go due to the  widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs .\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has become increasingly fraught over the past year - the US expelled the South African ambassador to Washington, cut some of its aid funding and slapped South Africa with tariffs of 30% (the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa).\n\nAnd finally, after initially saying he would send Vice-President JD Vance to the G20 summit, Trump abruptly announced two weeks ago that no US representatives would attend.\n\nThe government in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, has tried to maintain a defiant but diplomatic tone. It has firmly denied claims of a white genocide and insisted that the summit would proceed with or without the US.\n\nIn a sudden about face, and with less than 48 hours to go before the G20 conference, the US announced that it would be sending a small team of its in-country diplomats to the handover ceremony, but that it wouldn't take part in any discussions.\n\nAs tension between the two nations shows no sign of letting up, there are concerns that South African diplomats may be frozen out of meetings when the US takes over the G20 presidency next year.\n\nSouth Africa's Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters earlier this week that there's only one way they would not attend next year's meetings.\n\n\"We are members of the G20, we're not an invited country. So we don't need an invitation from anybody,\" he said.\n\n\"If the United States do not want us to participate, the only way they can do it is to decline us visas.\"\n\nSo will South Africa manage to reach its aims without the presence of the world's wealthiest nation? Professor Richard Calland, from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, thinks it can.\n\n\"I think that people who are serious-minded in their analysis will not attach much weight to [the US' absence],\" he says.\n\n\"Ironically, the absence of President Trump may create more space for real consensus, because people won't be constantly looking over their shoulder at him and trying to anticipate or navigate his conduct and his positioning.\"\n\nProf Calland adds that the absence of the US may enable middle powers to step up and push for the reforms they want by issuing a joint declaration.\n\nAnswering reporters' questions at the summit's venue in Johannesburg on Monday, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola echoed this sentiment.\n\n\"[The United States] are absent, so in their absence, the countries that are present must make a decision.\n\n\"We are forging ahead to persuade the countries that are present that we must adopt a leaders' declaration because the institution cannot be bogged down by someone who's absent,\" he said.\n\nThe leaders' declaration is a culmination of work done throughout the year to build consensus on issues affecting the global economy, including trade barriers, technological advancements and climate change. It outlines what decisions the members have agreed to act on moving forward.\n\nPresident Trump isn't the only head of state who will not be attending. China's Xi Jinping is sending his Premier Li Qiang, who has represented the president in a number of meetings this year.\n\nRussian leader  Vladimir Putin will also be absent due to the International Criminal Court's warrant against him .\n\nMexico's Claudia Sheinbaum is another leader who will not be attending.\n\nAnd Argentinian President and Trump ally, Javier Milei, is skipping the summit in solidarity with Washington.\n\nHowever, unlike the US, all of these countries are sending senior delegations to represent their countries' interests.\n\nMr Lamola was keen to downplay the significance of these absences, saying sometimes heads of state are not able to attend major events, and it is \"nothing abnormal\" for them to send a replacement.\n\nOther global powers have expressed their support of South Africa's presidency of the G20, including France, the UK and the European Union, which signed a deal with South Africa on Thursday agreeing to boost the extraction and, more importantly, the domestic processing, of critical minerals.\n\nAfrican countries have long argued that processing minerals in their countries before exporting them would boost their economies by providing much-needed development, jobs and income.\n\nThese are the types of initiatives that Pretoria has spent the year lobbying for across various working groups and ministerial meetings.\n\nSouth Africa is the last G20 country to take over the presidency in this current cycle. It's also the last country in the global south to host the gathering. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over the past three years.\n\nAs such, the South African government says it wants to use its presidency to bridge the developmental divide between the global north and south. It wants to push for equity, sustainability and shared prosperity.\n\nAlthough building consensus through multilateral institutions like the G20 is becoming increasingly fraught in a divided world, Prof Calland argues that it is needed more than ever.\n\n\"Human life on Earth is facing an existential set of challenges, whether it's climate change, demographic shifts, technological revolution and so on.\n\n\"All of these are hugely difficult pressure points for human society. And you can't deal with them unless there is international collaboration and cooperation,\" he says.\n\nPresident Trump and his supporters argue that multilateral organisations do little to change real people's lives, preferring instead bilateral deals done directly between two countries.\n\nBut South Africa and other developing countries argue that issues like reducing the cost of borrowing for poorer countries require the input of international institutions like the IMF and cannot be done through one-on-one deals.\n\nIn many ways, South Africa's presidency of the G20 is part of a wider debate around multilateralism and its effectiveness.\n\nIf South Africa is able to convince other G20 members to issue a joint declaration on Sunday, it might have succeeded in proving that consensus can be reached without the participation of the world's most powerful country.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75vn7yel73o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"22:38:19.376+00:00","title":"COP30: UN climate talks fail to secure new fossil fuel promises","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, ended without any binding commitments to phase out fossil fuels, disappointing over 80 countries including the UK and EU.

fail to secure new fossil fuel promises\n\nFollowing bitter rows, the UN climate summit COP30 in Belém, Brazil has ended with a deal that contains no direct reference to the fossil fuels that are heating up the planet.\n\nIt is a frustrating end for more than 80 countries including the UK and EU that wanted the meeting to commit the world to stop using using oil, coal and gas at a faster pace.\n\nBut oil-producing nations held the line that they should be allowed to use their fossil fuel resources to grow their economies.\n\nThe meeting takes place as the UN says it fears global efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels have failed.\n\nA representative for Colombia furiously criticised the COP presidency for not allowing countries to object to the deal in the final meeting on Saturday, known as a plenary.\n\n\"Colombia believes that we have sufficient scientific evidence saying that more than 75% of the global greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels,\" Daniela Durán González, Colombian Climate Delegate, told BBC News.\n\n\"So we do believe it's time that the Convention on Climate Change starts talking about that reality,\" she added.\n\nThe final deal, called the Mutirão, calls on countries to \"voluntarily\" accelerate their  action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.\n\nFor the first time, the US did not send a delegation after President Donald Trump said the country will leave the landmark Paris treaty that committed countries to act on climate change in 2015. He has branded climate change \"a con\".\n\nVeteran negotiator and former Germany climate envoy Jennifer Morgan told the BBC that the US absence was a \"hole\" in the negotiations. Often the US has supported blocs like the EU and UK.\n\n\"In a 12-hour negotiation overnight, when you have oil-producing countries pushing back hard, to not have someone counteracting on that, it certainly was hard,\" she said\n\nBut for many countries, the fact that the talks did not collapse or roll back on past climate agreements is a relief.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda Climate Ambassador Ruleta Thomas commented: \"We are happy that there is a process that continues to function [...] where every country can be heard.\"\n\nIn the final meeting, a representative for Saudi Arabia said: \"Each state must be allowed to build its own path, based on its respective circumstances and economies.\"\n\nLike many other leading oil-producing nations, the country has argued it should be allowed to exploit its fossil fuel reserves as others have done in the past.\n\nThe two weeks of talks were at times chaotic. Toilets ran out of water, torrential thunderstorms flooded the venue, and delegates struggled to cope in hot, humid rooms.\n\nThe COP's around 50,000 registered delegates were evacuated twice. A group of about 150 protestors broke into the venue, breaching security lines, and carrying placards reading \"our forests are not for sale\".\n\nOn Thursday a large fire broke out,  scorching a hole into the roof and forcing participants to rush outside.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva chose the city of Belém to put the world's attention on the Amazon rainforest and to bring a rush of finance to the city.\n\nDespite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil was criticised for its own plans to drill for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.\n\nIts offshore oil and gas production is on course to increase until the early 2030s, according to analysis shared with the BBC by campaign group Global Witness.\n\nCountries at the talks have competing interests, depending on their national circumstances and how exposed they are to the effects of climate change.

2025-11-22T08:56:28+00:00\n\nTitle: Bosnia’s Republika Srpska votes for Dodik’s successor: What to expect\n\nRepublika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Serb-majority entity, votes Sunday in a snap presidential election called after electoral authorities  stripped separatist Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik  of the presidency in August.\n\nDodik was removed after he was convicted for refusing to carry out decisions issued by  Christian Schmidt , the international peace envoy who oversees implementation of the Dayton peace agreement that ended the 1992–95 Bosnian War.\n\nThe court also handed him a  one-year prison sentence  – which he avoided by posting bail – and banned him from participating in politics for six years. Bosnia’s top court upheld that ruling in early November.\n\nIn October, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska appointed Ana Trisic-Babic as an interim president until the Sunday election.\n\nHere’s what we know about the vote, and why it matters.\n\nAccording to Bosnia’s Central Election Commission (CIK), voting will be open on Sunday, November 23, between 7am (06:00 GMT) and 7pm (18:00 GMT). More than 1.2 million people, spanning the three main ethnic groups – Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats – are eligible to vote. Turnout in previous presidential elections has typically ranged between 50 percent and 55 percent.\n\nAlthough Trisic-Babic was appointed as an interim president, the law still requires new elections within 90 days of a president’s removal.\n\nThe winner of Sunday’s election will serve only the remainder of Dodik’s term, less than a year, until next October’s general elections.\n\nPreliminary results are expected on election night, but the final official vote count by the Central Election Commission will be announced only after the body also validates all outcomes.\n\nRepublika Srpska is one of two main political entities within Bosnia, along with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – each of which enjoys significant autonomy. The two share equal rights over a small, third self-governing administrative unit within the country, known as the Brcko District.\n\nRepublika Srpska was proclaimed by Bosnian Serb leaders in 1992 at the start of the 1992–95 war and was formally established as part of Bosnia’s post-war constitutional structure in 1995 under the Dayton peace agreement.\n\nRepublika Srpska covers about 49 percent of Bosnia’s territory, while the remaining 51 percent forms the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nRepublika Srpska has its own government, parliament, judiciary and police, but not its own army.\n\nToday, it is overwhelmingly Serb-populated, with Serbs making up approximately  82 percent of its residents , alongside smaller Bosniak and Croat minorities, according to the latest census, which was held more than a decade ago in 2013.\n\nIts demographics changed drastically during and after the war, and because of  the ethnic cleansing of non-Serb communities.  Before the conflict, Bosniaks and Croats made up about half of the population in the area that is now Republika Srpska; today, they account for less than 17 percent.\n\nIts first president, Radovan Karadzic, has been sentenced to life in The Hague for the 1995  genocide against Bosniaks  in Srebrenica, now a town inside Republika Srpska.\n\nThe elections come at a highly sensitive time for Bosnia. Since Russia’s 2022  invasion of Ukraine , Republika Srpska has intensified its rhetoric to secede from Bosnia, with Dodik – a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin – increasingly calling for the entity to break away, potentially to join Serbia.\n\nThese elections will determine who replaces Dodik after his removal from office and his long dominance over Republika Srpska’s politics. The vote is also a test of how much influence he can still exert, despite being banned from political activity.\n\nThere are six candidates on the ballot, four nominated by Republika Srpska’s political parties, and two running as independents.\n\nThe main contenders are Sinisa Karan of Dodik’s ruling Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), who is directly backed by Dodik, and Branko Blanusa of the opposition Serb Democratic Party (SDS).\n\nKaran is a longtime member of Dodik’s inner circle and a former Republika Srpska interior minister. He serves as minister for scientific and technological development and higher education in the current Republika Srpska government.\n\nAccording to  Radio Free Europe , he was part of a group ‘tasked’ to draft an SNSD plan for Republika Srpska to break away from Bosnia.\n\nAnalysts say Dodik sees Karan as an extension of his own power. Dodik has appeared prominently at Karan’s rallies.\n\nBlanusa, the SDS candidate, is a member of the party’s Banja Luka City Committee and a professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Banja Luka.\n\nThe SDS, now the main opposition party in Republika Srpska, was originally led by Karadzic. It is also a Serb nationalist party and has long competed with Dodik’s SNSD for the same electorate.\n\nWhile it is critical of Dodik’s style of governance and allegations of corruption, it broadly shares similar positions on key political issues, including relations with the capital Sarajevo and scepticism towards the international overseer of the peace agreement.\n\nThe other party-backed candidates are Nikola Lazarevic of the Ecological Party of Republika Srpska and Dragan Dokanovic of the Alliance for New Politics (SNP).\n\nTwo independents, Igor Gasevic and Slavko Dragicevic, are also on the ballot but have remained almost entirely outside the public eye.\n\nMilorad Dodik, 66, is the former president of Republika Srpska.\n\nBacked by Western governments in the late 1990s, he became the entity’s prime minister in 1998 and was seen as a promising alternative to the hardline nationalist leadership of genocide convict Karadzic and the then-ruling SDS, which dominated the post-war period. Then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described Dodik as “a breath of fresh air”, and both the United States and the United Kingdom placed their hopes in him as a more moderate future option.\n\nHe was among the first leaders in Republika Srpska to acknowledge the Srebrenica genocide. In a 2007 interview with a Bosnian television outlet, Dodik, the president of SNSD since its formation, said he knew “perfectly well what took place” and that “there was a genocide in Srebrenica”.\n\n“That judgement was made by the court in The Hague, and that is an undeniable legal fact,” he said.\n\nHe has served three terms as president of Republika Srpska, holding two consecutive mandates from 2010 to 2018 and winning again in 2022. In 2018, he was elected as the Serb member of Bosnia’s three-member presidency.\n\nDuring this period, however, Dodik adopted a far more nationalist stance,  repeatedly calling  for the entity’s secession, and denying the Srebrenica genocide – going back on his own earlier admissions.\n\nIn 2023, Dodik signed two controversial bills that, in essence, said that decisions of the Dayton Agreement peace envoy and rulings of Bosnia’s constitutional court would not apply to Republika Srpska. The peace envoy and the constitutional court blocked those bills.\n\nIn March 2025, the constitutional court issued arrest warrants for Milorad Dodik and several of his allies on charges of undermining the constitutional order. But a month later, members of the Republika Srpska police blocked officers from the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) from entering the administrative centre of the Republika Srpska government to arrest Dodik, further intensifying tensions with Sarajevo.\n\nIn August, Bosnia’s electoral authorities stripped Dodik of the presidency and banned him from participating in politics. He, however, remains the president of the SNSD party and continues to be its most powerful figure.\n\nYes. Bosnia as a country relies on a power-sharing system in which the two entities are closely linked. Republika Srpska’s challenge against state institutions and the rise of secessionist threats can affect the stability of the country on the national level.\n\nThe early election also strains Bosnia’s economy. The vote is funded from the state budget, rather than the entity’s own institutions, in a country with  one of the smallest economies  in Europe. Bosnia’s Central Election Commission has allocated more than six million Bosnian marks (close to $4m) for the elections.\n\nThe UK government, one of the guarantors of  the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, said at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Bosnia in October that holding presidential elections in the Republika Srpska would give “an opportunity for formation of their new government,” insisting that “the constitutional order and rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be upheld”.\n\n“We encourage a focus on constructive and cooperative politics, including between Bosnia and Herzegovina’s two entities,” Jennifer MacNaughtan, the UK representative, said at the meeting.\n\nIn October, Russia, a strong ally of Republika Srpska, praised the transfer of power from Dodik to interim president Babic, but had also said that the Office of the High Representative peace envoy (OHR) should be “permanently closed”, echoing Dodik’s stance.\n\nIn conversation with the media, the spokesperson of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, said the Russian Federation “wholeheartedly supports” the struggle of the leadership of Republika Srpska against “eroding fundamental principles” of the Dayton peace treaty.\n\nThe US has not officially commented on the elections, but the Department of the Treasury has recently  lifted sanctions  against Dodik, his family members and his allies, including the SNDS candidate Karan, for undermining the Dayton peace agreement. Bosnia’s Serb officials have suggested they were quietly seeking a more cooperative relationship with the US, while still preserving their friendly ties with Russia.\n\nRepublika Srpska’s strongest ally, Serbia, has taken a more cautious stance than usual. In an interview with the state-owned Radio Television of Serbia, Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic – who has faced  antigovernment protests  that have shaken the country for almost a year now – avoided commenting on the elections directly. He said he wished “all the best” to Republika Srpska and hoped everything would “pass peacefully”. He added that Serbia would always be there to help with “infrastructure”.\n\nIf SNSD’s Karan wins, the entity would likely remain under Dodik’s influence. Speaking to Euronews Serbia, Karan said the vote had been “forced” onto Republika Srpska by the peace envoy Schmidt and that a vote for him is “a vote for President Dodik”.\n\nThe ruling SNSD also holds a strong majority in the National Assembly of Republika Srpska.\n\nBlanusa, from the opposition SDS party, told local BN television that Republika Srpska, under the current leadership, has become “impoverished, displaced and isolated”, and has pledged to make tackling corruption in the entity his main goal.\n\nIndeed, the entity faces deep economic challenges. According to the  Database of Economic Indicators of Republika Srpska , total gross domestic product (GDP) for 2023 was about 16 billion Bosnian marks (about $9bn), half of the GDP of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – and so, a third of the national economy.\n\nThe election verdict could also offer clues to political trends ahead of next year’s October elections, which could determine who rules the entity for another four years."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/india-says-cop30-should-be-about-climate-adaptation-but-dries-up-key-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:08:16+00:00","title":"India wants COP30 to focus on climate adaptation, but dries up own fund","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India has championed climate adaptation at the COP30 climate summit, calling for a global shift in focus to adaptation, particularly for vulnerable populations.

adaptation, but dries up own fund\n\nIndian-administered Kashmir  – On the night of September 2, Shabir Ahmad’s home was swallowed by mud and swept into the river after relentless rains triggered a landslide in Sarh village in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Reasi district.\n\n“I had been building my house brick by brick since 2016. It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.\n\n“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”\n\nBhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.\n\n“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.\n\nBack at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.\n\n“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.\n\n“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article addresses the recent political announcement by President Donald Trump to restart U.S. nuclear weapon testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as involving only noncritical, non-explosive component tests.

will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024 and spread across all provinces and territories, resulting in 5,000 cases and two deaths.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewjlr0v02ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"21:25:47.822+00:00","title":"Mystery drones halt air traffic near Dutch city of Eindhoven","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Unidentified drones have disrupted air traffic near Eindhoven, Netherlands, with initial sightings at the Volkel air force base and subsequent closures of airspace at the main airport.

2025-11-22T02:07:19.544+00:00\n\nTitle: India's blind women cricketers chase history at first T20 World Cup\n\nThe ongoing inaugural Blind Women's T20 Cricket World Cup has put the spotlight on visually impaired Indian women who have overcome immense challenges to reach this stage.\n\nThey come from villages, farming families and small-town hostels, with many learning the sport only in the past few years.\n\nThe T20 tournament - a six-team event featuring India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and the USA -  began on 11 November in Delhi. After a few matches in Bengaluru, the venue for the knockouts has now moved to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo.\n\nThe 16-member Indian squad represents nine states - Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Assam, and Bihar. Many players were introduced to the sport through schoolteachers, disability organisations, or community camps.\n\n\"Most of the players are from rural backgrounds,\" said team manager Shika Shetty. \"Language and culture were barriers, families and teachers were often unwilling to let them pursue the sport, and even introducing the rules of blind cricket took time. But now they are all competing with pride.\"\n\nBlind cricket uses a plastic ball with metal bearings that jingle, and players are grouped by sight: B1 (fully blind), B2 and B3. Teams must field a mix of all three. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground. B1 batters use runners for safety, and each run they score counts as two.\n\nThe World Cup features six teams in a single round-robin. India won all five matches and were the first side to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nIndia's team is captained by Deepika TC, a Karnataka native who lost her sight as a baby after an accident. She grew up in a farming family, unaware that sport would define her life.\n\nCricket reached her through specialised schools, where teachers encouraged her to try the game despite her hesitation. Over time, the sport gave her direction and confidence, she says.\n\nLeading India in the World Cup carries deep meaning for her.\n\n\"This is the biggest moment of my and my team's life. Earlier this month, the sighted Indian women's cricket team won the World Cup in Navi Mumbai, and we want to make it a double this month,\" Deepika said.\n\nShe said support from Indian women's World Cup winner Jemimah Rodrigues and men's Test captain Shubman Gill had been very meaningful.\n\nVice-captain Ganga Kadam of Maharashtra, from a family of nine siblings, was enrolled in a school for the blind by her farmer father to secure a stable future.\n\nShe played cricket casually until a mentor urged her to take it seriously. Learning to trust sound, timing, and orientation was challenging. The 26-year-old's progress came through persistence rather than immediate results, and she now inspires visually impaired girls in her village to play sports.\n\nAnother on the team, top-order batter Anekha Devi, 20, from Jammu and Kashmir, was born partially blind. Her uncle, also visually impaired, urged her to attend a blind cricket camp in Delhi after school.\n\nShe remembers early sessions as overwhelming, with unfamiliar voices and techniques. But she adapted quickly and surprised coaches with her grasp of the audible ball system.\n\nWithin two years she reached the national team and often speaks of wanting to become the role model she never had for herself.\n\nHer 18-year-old all-rounder teammate, Phula Saren, from a tribal community in Odisha, lost vision in her left eye at five, as well as her mother soon after. She discovered cricket through a teacher at a school for the blind.\n\nTravelling to tournaments was challenging, and persuading her family took time, but she persisted. Her turning point wasn't a trophy -  it was realising she belonged at the national level.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunita Sarathe from Madhya Pradesh didn't step into cricket directly from school. She completed college, explored various jobs, and only joined a blind cricket camp on a friend's recommendation.\n\nThe sport felt \"fast and complicated\", but she kept returning. Coaches say she trained intensely because she felt she had joined \"late\". She is now one of India's most reliable fielders.\n\nHeadquartered in London, the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) has overseen the sport since 1996. While the men's game has a longer history -  with the first 50-over World Cup in 1998 and the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2012 - this year marks the first-ever women's Blind Cricket World Cup.\n\nIndia's women's blind cricket setup is still young. The Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI), which governs blind cricket nationally, was established in 2011. Systematic scouting for a women's team began in 2019, leading to their first international match in 2023 and a gold medal at the IBSA World Games in Birmingham the same year.\n\n\"We believed we were doing injustice by not giving visually impaired women the same opportunities as the men,\" said Mahantesh GK, CABI's chairperson.\n\n\"Creating this tournament took huge effort. Money was a challenge. Getting teams was a challenge. But we persisted. Now the response from both the central and many state governments, sponsors, the corporate world and the public has been remarkable. The future will be much bigger.\"\n\nThe semifinals and final of the World Cup will be held in Colombo, with the final set for Sunday. All matches are streamed live on CABI's YouTube channel and state-run Prasar Bharati platforms, while India's games are also broadcast on national broadcaster Doordarshan, giving the sport a major visibility boost.\n\n\"As more countries field women's teams, the standard and global footprint for women's blind cricket will rise quickly,\" Mr Mahantesh says.\n\nCoach Shetty believes the visibility will change how families respond to girls entering the sport.\n\n\"Now that people have watched these matches on livestreams and seen these women perform, families will feel more confident about allowing their daughters to play. It will not feel like an unknown path anymore.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8qdm5zg10o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"22:25:44.520+00:00","title":"Jair Bolsonaro: Brazilian ex-president arrested after being determined a flight risk","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, has been taken into custody after being declared a 'concrete flight risk' during house arrest, following new evidence that he planned to use a rally organized by his son as a cover to break free from electronic monitoring.

Brazilian ex-president arrested after being determined a flight risk\n\nJair Bolsonaro has been taken into custody after being determined a \"concrete flight risk\" while under house arrest.\n\nThe right-wing former Brazilian president was  found guilty of plotting a military coup in September  and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison, but he remains under house arrest pending appeals.\n\nBrazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said the move to detain the 70-year-old was a preventative measure after \"new facts\" came to light.\n\nBolsonaro admitted he had tried to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron - but denied he wanted to remove it. Court officials said he wanted to use a planned rally outside outside his house as a cover to break free.\n\nIn a filing authorising the arrest, Justice Moraes said information from the centre monitoring Bolsonaro's house arrest suggested the former president's \"intention to break the electronic ankle bracelet to ensure success in his escape\".\n\nThis, it said, would be \"facilitated by the confusion caused by the demonstration called by his son\".\n\nFlávio Bolsonaro, who serves a senator, called for a gathering of his supporters near his father's home to take place on Saturday night.\n\nThe senator wrote on social media on Friday: \"Are you going to fight for your country, or watch it all from your phone there on your sofa? I invite you to fight with us.\"\n\nHe said the vigil would enable supporters to \"pray for his health and for the return of democracy in our country\".\n\nTo explain his decision, Justice Moraes cited the possibility of Bolsonaro fleeing to foreign embassies, citing \"a history of planning to request asylum through a diplomatic representation\".\n\nThe court filing notes that the US embassy in the capital, Brasilia, is located about 13km (8 miles) from Bolsonaro's home.\n\nBolsonaro's legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to  impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods .\n\nBolsonaro is being held in a police station in Brasilia and will undergo a custody hearing on Sunday.\n\nIt was only on Friday that the former president's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to allow him to serve his whole jail sentence under house arrest, with electronic monitoring.\n\nThey also asked that Bolsonaro be allowed to leave his home for medical treatment, saying he required regular treatment for pulmonary infections and other ailments.\n\nBolsonaro was found guilty of leading  a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election  to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nSupreme Court justices said that he knew of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes - who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.\n\nThe conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.\n\nBut a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.\n\nThe justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.\n\nAt the time, Bolsonaro's lawyers called the 27 years and three months sentence \"absurdly excessive\".\n\nHe was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.\n\nThe former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" and said it was designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvdyg348pko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"19:21:08.981+00:00","title":"JFK granddaughter shares terminal cancer diagnosis","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of President John F.

Greene went from Trump ally to quitting Congress\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene came into Congress as one of Donald Trump's staunchest defenders.\n\nSworn into office just days before the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, Greene supported the president - and echoed his contention that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" - when many in the Republican Party disavowed him.\n\nNow, five years later, Greene will leave Congress having been branded a \"traitor\" by the man she once revered.\n\nOver the course of just a handful of months, Greene broke with Trump in the most dramatic fashion.\n\nAlthough Greene had criticised Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran, his support for Israel during the Gaza War and a lack of sufficient regulation of big technology companies earlier this year,  the final fracture began over Jeffrey Epstein , the late financier and convicted paedophile who had connections to the wealthy and powerful.\n\nShe condemned Trump's unwillingness to order his justice department to fully release its files on the case, and appeared alongside Epstein's victims – and Democrats - to force a House vote on the matter.\n\nIt didn't end there, however.\n\nGreene would also question Republican strategy during the recent government shutdown, siding with Democrats in calling on her party to address expiring healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans.\n\nShe publicly berated Trump for what she said was an undue emphasis on foreign policy at the expense of addressing economic and affordability concerns.\n\n\"The American people aren't motivated by foreign wars or bailouts for other countries,\" she wrote on X earlier this month. \"They want leaders who show up, do the job, and fight for them every single day!\"\n\nGreene continued to insist that she supported Trump, but it became increasingly clear that she has a view of the \"America First\" movement that differs from the US president's.\n\nAn activist turned congresswoman who made her name railing against the political establishment had now found that the Maga – \"Make America Great Again\" - movement she supported had become the establishment.\n\nAnd as the weight of Trump's power focused on her ouster – she  broke for the exits with a few parting shots .\n\n\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better,\" she said in her resignation statement.\n\n\"If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.\"\n\nThroughout her career, she often embraced controversy and leaned into conflict.\n\nA gym instructor in Georgia, she began engaging in politics in 2016, as Trump started his successful campaign for the White House. She made frequent trips to Washington DC, where she would berate Democratic members of Congress for what she said were their socialist and pro-Islam policies.\n\nShe promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, questioning whether shootings in a US school were \"staged\" and alleging that the Democratic party was secretly run by a group of powerful paedophiles.\n\nOnce in Congress, she clashed with Democrats - and members of her own party. Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the House voted to  remove her from her committee assignments  shortly after she took office.\n\nWhen Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson, and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well.\n\nIn 2023, she was expelled from the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nShe had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington.\n\nAnd then she didn't.\n\nIn a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene's departure from Congress was \"great news for the country\".\n\nHe would later post on Truth Social that Greene \"went bad\" but that he would \"always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to our country\".\n\nGreene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a \"new path ahead\". Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state's governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.\n\nHer decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without Trump's support.\n\nThe move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never appear on a presidential ballot again.\n\nAt 51, Greene's tenure in Congress may be at an end, but her involvement in American political life may be far from over."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:15:11.302+00:00","title":"What we know about leaked US draft plan to end Russia's Ukraine war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked draft US-Russia peace plan proposes significant territorial and military concessions to Ukraine, including the transfer of Ukrainian-controlled areas in Donetsk Oblast to de facto Russian control, a reduction of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000, and a pledge that Ukraine will not join NATO.

and we now know that it proposes to hand over those areas of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the  de facto  control of Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nLatest versions of the text also call for Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces to 600,000 people.\n\nBut what else is known about the text and who stands to benefit from it most?\n\nThere are 28 key points and there are several on the face of it that could be acceptable to Ukraine. Others come across as vague and imprecise.\n\nUkraine's sovereignty would be \" confirmed\"  and there would be a  \"total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe\" , with robust or reliable  \"security guarantees\"  for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.\n\nIf Russia were to invade Ukraine a  \"robust co-ordinated military response\"  is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.\n\nAlthough elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.\n\nBut on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.\n\nAmong the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"\n\nCeding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.\n\n\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"\n\nUkraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nWhile 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.\n\n\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"\n\nThe draft also proposes that \" Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\" .\n\nIn other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".\n\nElsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThe draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:\n\n\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"\n\n\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"\n\nThere is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries.\n\nJoining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"\n\nOther draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a  \"non-nuclear state\".\n\nThat appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.\n\nSeveral points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with  \"Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy\"  and invited back into the G8 group of powers.\n\nThat seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.\n\nIf the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.\n\nThe draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested  \"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\" , with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.\n\nThe sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).\n\nSome €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.\n\nThe rest of those frozen assets would go to a  \"US-Russian investment vehicle\" , under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.\n\nSeveral commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.\n\nBut it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.\n\nWe know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.\n\nEqually US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nIn some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent.\n\nThe European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.\n\nRussian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. Russia's response has so far been cautious but Putin has said it  could be the \"basis\" for a peace settlement .\n\nThe handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.\n\nOne of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be  \"agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis\"  - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.\n\nHowever, a plan for a  \"full amnesty\"  for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.\n\nCommentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.\n\nRussia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as \"the root causes\" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.\n\nSome of the other 28 points of the draft also nod to Russia's claims of discrimination against Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them.\n\nOne point is explicit but even-handed:  \"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"\n\nAnother apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe -  \"equally between Russia and Ukraine\" ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz32pz81vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"01:58:29.151+00:00","title":"Radiohead deliver a spell-binding, hit-packed set in London","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Radiohead deliver a spell-binding, hit-packed set at London’s O2 Arena after a nine-year gap since their last new material release and 99 months since their last UK gig.

London\n\n\"Whenever you're ready,\" says Thom Yorke, adopting the tone of a schoolteacher waiting for an unruly class to settle down, as Radiohead get ready to play their encore at London's O2 Arena.\n\nIt's a rare flash of humour from the frontman, whose onstage utterings are mostly limited to mumbled \"thank yous\". But it's also an acknowledgment of how long fans have been waiting for this show.\n\nIt is now 10 years since Radiohead last released new material, and 99 months since their last UK gig.\n\nAnticipation for their return has been building ever since they announced a limited run of concerts in September. Setlists from early shows in Spain and Italy have generated news stories (\"Radiohead play Nice Dream for the first time since 2009\"), as fans pore over the song choices.\n\nAccording to one source, they've rehearsed 65 different numbers.\n\nAt the O2, the band sift through their entire discography - from the arena rock anthems of 1994's The Bends to the celestial ballads of A Moon Shaped Pool, via the layered electronics of Kid A, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n\nThere are some signs that Radiohead are a bit rusty. A few timing and tuning issues crop up, which could easily be the result of a first night in a new venue, but which feel odd for a band of such technical proficiency.\n\nBut when it comes together, it's a rapturous, spell-binding sight.\n\nThey begin with the spacey, hypnotic Planet Telex, and follow it up with a crunchy version of  2+2=5, written in 2003 as a reaction to George W Bush's \"War on Terror\", and taking on new urgency in a world where political norms have seemingly been turned upside down.\n\nBy the third song, Sit Down, Stand Up, they're flexing their musical muscles, with an extended outro of percussive lunacy, aided by US session musician Chris Vatalaro.\n\nHis addition to the line-up is a giveaway. Radiohead's secret sauce has always been their rhythm section - who manage to locate sinewy, danceable grooves even when presented with their bandmate's most challenging material.\n\nThe prowling bassline of National Anthem and the slamming drum loops of Idioteque, in particular, give the audience ample opportunity to jump up and down.\n\nThat said, it's amusing to watch bassist Colin Greenwood try (and fail) to get the crowd clapping in time to the glitchy and unconventional rhythms of 15 Step.\n\nInstead, most of them simply bob their heads up and down in unified appreciation of the music. At times, it looks like a convention of nodding dogs.\n\nCushioned between the more experimental songs, however, were the real crowd-pleasers: An elegiac version of Lucky, a beautifully twisted No Surprises and a genuinely sublime version of Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.\n\nI have a theory, however, that the band's notorious dislike of \"the old stuff\" is an elaborate ruse. They've never really stopped playing songs from The Bends and OK Computer - but the suggestion they  won't  makes it all the more exciting when they break into something anthemic like Fake Plastic Trees.\n\nThat song opened Friday night's encore, which dwelt largely on their 90s material, including Let Down - a deep cut that's had a new lease of life on TikTok - and the epic Paranoid Android.\n\nIntroducing a muscular version of Just, Yorke explains that it was written \"on a freezing cold farm in 1994\", in a period where they thought they'd only be remembered for one song: Their 1992 breakout Creep.\n\nWe all know the story ended differently, but the reunion does find Radiohead in a strange position.\n\nThis tour comes with no new material, and the last seven years have been so fertile with side projects, most notably Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood's three albums as The Smile, that it seemed Radiohead's members might have permanently moved on.\n\nSeveral factors got in the way - grief, parenthood, mental health and rumours of intra-band tension over Israel.\n\nAs recently as August,  Yorke said  a reunion was \"not on the cards from where I'm sitting\".\n\nAll of which makes the decision to play in the round, packed like sardines in a crushed tin can, all the more significant.\n\nThe group are symbolically returning to the rehearsal room, playing off each other as much as they are playing to the audience.\n\nYorke glides across the stage, doing that dance he does, moving from acoustic guitar to electric piano and back again.\n\nDuring Idioteque, guitarist Ed O'Brien catches him mid-transit, and they holler the lyrics directly to one another. At the start of Jigsaw Falling Into Place, Yorke and Greenwood face each other and play duelling guitars.\n\nIt suggests the tour has been an act of healing, even if the band have been assigned separate dressing rooms for the first time in their career.\n\nWhether that leads to anything more is still up for debate. \"We haven't thought past the tour,\"  Yorke recently told the Times . \"I'm just stunned we got this far.\"\n\nThe delighted fans who queued for the Tube home singing Karma Police will be hoping everything is in its right place for a fully-fledged comeback.\n\nPlanet Telex\n\n2 + 2 = 5\n\nSit Down, Stand Up\n\nLucky\n\nBloom\n\n15 Step\n\nThe Gloaming\n\nKid A\n\nNo Surprises\n\nVideotape\n\nWeird Fishes/Arpeggi\n\nIdioteque\n\nEverything in Its Right Place\n\nThe National Anthem\n\nDaydreaming\n\nJigsaw Falling Into Place\n\nBodysnatchers\n\nThere There\n\nEncore :\n\nFake Plastic Trees\n\nLet Down\n\nParanoid Android\n\nYou and Whose Army?\n\nA Wolf at the Door\n\nJust\n\nKarma Police"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydg8w7kxvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"23:02:17.660+00:00","title":"Trump says US plan to end Ukraine war not 'final offer' for Kyiv","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a developing diplomatic effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war, the United States has presented a 28-point peace plan that proposes Ukrainian troop withdrawals from eastern and southern regions, border freezes, and a cap on Ukraine’s military to 600,000 personnel.

Russia-Ukraine war is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukrainian allies voiced concerns over proposals.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, leaders from Europe, Canada and Japan said the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\", but would \"require additional work\", citing concerns over border changes and caps on Ukraine's army.\n\nOn Sunday, security officials from Britain, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine will meet in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over US pressure to accept the plan seen as favourable to Moscow.\n\nTrump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point plan, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement.\n\nWhen asked on Saturday whether the current draft plan was his final offer for Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"No, not my final offer.\"\n\n\"One way or another we have to get it [the war] ended, so we're working on it,\" he added.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will be among those taking part in talks in Geneva on Sunday. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell will attend on the UK's behalf.\n\nSaturday's joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials were also among the signatories.\n\nThe statement said: \"We believe therefore that the draft is a basis which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\n\n\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\"\n\nIt added: \"The implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members respectively\".\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is at the G20 summit in Johannesburg, spoke to Zelensky on the phone on Saturday, followed by a call with Trump.\n\nOn the Trump call, a Downing Street spokesman said Sir Keir \"relayed the discussions that have been taking place between Coalition of the Willing partners [Ukraine's allies] in attendance at the G20 summit today\".\n\nThey added: \"The leaders agreed their teams would work together on the 28-point US peace proposal in Geneva tomorrow. They agreed to speak again tomorrow.\"\n\nSir Keir earlier said he was concerned about proposed caps on Ukraine's military in the US plan, saying \"it's fundamental that Ukraine has to be able to defend itself if there's a ceasefire\".\n\nThe widely leaked US peace plan  proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nThe plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.\n\nThe US draft would also limit Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.\n\nKyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.\n\nThe plan also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the US proposals, adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a stark warning that the country \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\".\n\n\"Today is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\" Zelensky added, pledging to work \"constructively\" with the Americans on the plan.\n\nOn Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.\n\n\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.\n\nKyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.\n\nPutin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail.\n\nHe added Moscow was willing to \"show flexibility\" - but was also prepared to fight on.\n\nPutin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in Ukraine's south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat casualties."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdege0k962do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"20:04:18.132+00:00","title":"Christian converts are among the Iranians being sent home from US","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the experiences of Iranian Christian converts who have been deported from the US despite having asylum claims, highlighting systemic issues in how religious persecution is assessed.

detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.\n\nThey told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.\n\nMajid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.\n\nWhen US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.\n\nMajid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.\n\nTheir experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".\n\nA White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.\n\nAs the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, which was a central plank of Trump's winning re-election campaign, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers.\n\nIn late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.\n\nDozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.\n\nAmong the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.\n\n\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"\n\nFor Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.\n\nAttorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.\n\nConverts from Islam make up a significant share of Iran's estimated 800,000 Christian population, says Steve Dew-Jones of Article 18, a UK-based advocacy group that monitors violations against Christians in the country.\n\nWith officially recognised churches tightly restricted,  house churches  have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.\n\nConverting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.\n\nArrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.\n\nSome Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.\n\nBut it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.\n\n\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"\n\nAsylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.\n\nIn late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.\n\nAfter their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"\n\nPastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.\n\nHe says they entered legally through a humanitarian programme and had work authorisations. \"How can it be dangerous for the wife but not for the husband?\" asks pastor, Ara Torosian, who himself fled Iran in 2010 after being detained for smuggling Bibles.\n\nMajid, who managed to slip through the airport in Turkey, has been living in limbo since, while his lawyer follows up on his case. His wife, whose asylum case is still pending, now lives in Los Angeles with their 1.5-year-old daughter - a child who has never met her father.\n\nIn the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.\n\n\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran?

His  resignation is the latest blow to the corporation , and it looks timed to add to the pressure.\n\nBanerji's role on the board was due to end on 31 December anyway but he has instead resigned early, three days before other board members are due to face a committee of MPs - and nearly two weeks after the BBC  lost its director general and its CEO of news .\n\nThe resignation, fairly or not, looks like a direct criticism of the BBC's chair Samir Shah.\n\nBanerji, according to an insider, was known to be angry that Shah was - in his view - weak in not challenging a number of other board members and their assertion about systemic bias at BBC News.\n\nIn this characterisation, the four political appointees to the board - Shah is the fifth - have banded together around the view that the BBC too often suffers from liberal groupthink, and the chair has been unable, or unwilling, to steer his board to a place of real consensus.\n\nIn the end, after all the drama of the past few weeks - the leaked memo, the resignations, the apology over the Panorama edit and the  threat of a defamation suit by Donald Trump  - it boils down to one simple question. Is BBC News institutionally biased?\n\nDeborah Turness and Tim Davie reject that. So does Shah. While acknowledging mistakes have been made, he told me \"the BBC News DNA and culture is to be impartial, to provide the best news we can and the most trustworthy news we can\".\n\nBBC News remains the most trusted source of news in the UK.\n\nBut if some members of the board believe that the BBC does suffer from systemic bias, and others do not, where does this end?\n\nA senior TV executive told me Shah inherited \"a house divided but this board is melting down, it's very sad\". They added: \"It's a leadership issue.\"\n\nWhen I interviewed him after the resignations of Davie and Turness, Shah told me the board had \"a diversity of views, as there are in the public, as there are in the country itself… I want robust conversations, I want discussion\".\n\nBut Banerji has now claimed he was not consulted over the events that led to those departures.\n\nIf true, it will feed into the narrative advanced in some quarters that what has happened has been a coup by some members of the board.\n\nSir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called on the government to remove Sir Robbie Gibb, an ex-BBC executive and former Downing Street director of communications to Theresa May, from the board.\n\nShah told me the notion of a coup was \"fanciful\". He added that \"it's unfair and it's disrespectful to the members of the board to say that because they feel strongly about something, that somehow it's to do with their history\".\n\nBut Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC's Six o'clock and Ten o'clock News, who was later director of communications at Number 10 under David Cameron, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"the stakes were already high for Samir Shah and they just got even higher\".\n\nHe added that \"all eyes are going to be on Samir Shah on Monday\".\n\n\"The questions I think he's going to really have to answer are, is it true that months ago you chaired a BBC meeting where the Panorama issue was on the table and you decided to take no action? And if so why - particularly after what you've now said - did you not take action then?\n\n\"And I think that the next question that he's really going to have face is, when Michael Prescott's report was leaked to the Telegraph, why did you preside over such a long time of the BBC not coming out, particularly when the executive wanted to get out and cauterize the issue as cleanly as possible?\"\n\nIn the last few days, prior to Banerji's resignation, I spoke to insiders at the BBC as well as people outside, who told me that Shah will remain as chair, whatever his perceived shortcomings. As one person put it to me, \"you can't have the DG, the CEO of News and the chair all resign\".\n\nDoes Banerji's resignation shift the dial on his ability to continue in the role? It certainly makes Shah's appearance along with fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson in front of the Culture Media and Sport Committee on Monday even more critical.\n\nMPs on that committee voiced their reservations about whether he was qualified for the job when he was appointed as chair last year.\n\nHe will need to demonstrate to those MPs, the industry, BBC audiences and staff at the corporation who will be watching, that he has the capabilities and support needed to steer the BBC through these turbulent times."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgkeyl78rwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"16:33:16.262+00:00","title":"Canada Post and union reach deal in principle to end strike","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) have reached a tentative agreement to end a prolonged strike that began in September 2024, following years of negotiations over pay, benefits, and proposed operational changes.

Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated.\n\nThe summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from what some have called the \"COP of truth\".\n\nBrazil - not their finest hour\n\nThe most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat\n\nBut many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted.\n\nAnd despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting.\n\nRight from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible.\n\nSo Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP.\n\nThe idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations.\n\nDo Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that.\n\nWhile the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return.\n\nColombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas.\n\nTo find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion.\n\nIt made matters worse.\n\nNegotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy.\n\nThe EU were given short shrift by major producers.\n\n\"We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,\" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer.\n\nOuch!\n\nNothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse.\n\nBrazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP.\n\nThese were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain.\n\nEU had a bad COP\n\nThey are the richest group of nations still in the  Paris Agreement  but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour.\n\nWhile they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of.\n\nThe idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft.\n\nThe wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the \"tripling\" word stayed in the text.\n\nSo when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in.\n\n\"Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,\" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics.\n\n\"This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union.\"\n\nThe EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front.\n\nFuture of COP in question\n\nThe most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself.\n\nTwo often heard positions:\n\nHow barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words?\n\nHow ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks?\n\nThe COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore.\n\n\"We can't discard it entirely,\" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News.\n\n\"But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far.\"\n\nEnergy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people.\n\nIt is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore.\n\nBrazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an \"implementation cop\" and put a lot of focus on the \"energy agenda\". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant.\n\nCOP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance.\n\nTrade comes in from the cold\n\nFor the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an \"orchestrated\" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G.\n\n'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking.\n\nThe answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it.\n\nThey say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - \"unilateral\" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive.\n\nThe Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad.\n\nIf you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves.\n\nEconomists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials.\n\nThe issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization.\n\nTrump gains by staying away - China gains by staying quiet\n\nThe world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways.\n\nUS President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here.\n\nRussia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals.\n\nAnd ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels.\n\n\"China kept a low political profile,\" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society.\n\n\"And they focussed on making money in the real world.\"\n\n\"Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position.\"\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter  to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

injections derived from fish sperm\n\nIn my many years as a journalist, I never thought I would be asking someone how it feels to have trout sperm injected into their face.\n\nAnd yet, here I am.\n\nAbby is lying on a large, black padded chair at a small aesthetics clinic in south Manchester.\n\nShe winces as a small cannula is delicately inserted into her cheek.\n\n\"Ouch. Ouch,\" she exclaims.\n\nI should make it clear that 29-year-old Abby is not actually receiving a pure dose of trout sperm.\n\nThe lower part of her face is being injected with tiny fragments of DNA, known as polynucleotides, which have been extracted from either trout or salmon sperm.\n\nWhy? Well, interestingly, our DNA is pretty similar to that of a fish.\n\nSo the hope is Abby's body will not only welcome these tiny strands of fish DNA, her skin cells will be spurred into action, producing more collagen and elastin, two proteins which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of our skin.\n\nFor Abby, the aim is to freshen her skin, keep it healthy, and hopefully, treat the acne she's lived with for many years by reducing scarring and redness.\n\n\"I just want to target those problem areas,\" she explains.\n\nPolynucleotides are being touted as the next big skincare \"miracle\" and are rapidly gaining popularity after a number of celebrities have spoken candidly about their \"salmon sperm facials\".\n\nEarlier this year, Charli XCX told her nine million Instagram followers that she felt \"fillers are kind of over now\", and explained she had moved onto polynucleotides, which are \"kinda like deep vitamins\".\n\nKim and Khloe Kardashian are also reportedly avid fans. And when asked about her skincare routine on a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jennifer Aniston responded: \"Don't I have beautiful salmon skin?\"\n\nSo, despite their fishy beginnings, are polynucleotides transforming skincare?\n\n\"We are having a Benjamin Button moment,\" Suzanne Mansfield, who works for aesthetics company Dermafocus, tells me.\n\nThat's a reference to the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, where Brad Pitt plays a man who ages backwards. By the time he's in his later years, he has the skin of a baby's bottom.\n\nWhile such an effect is highly unlikely and would probably be a tad disconcerting, Ms Mansfield says polynucleotides are forging the way when it comes to regenerative skincare.\n\nA small but growing body of research and  clinical trials suggest that injecting polynucleotides can rejuvenate skin , not only making it healthier but potentially reducing fine lines, wrinkles and scars.\n\n\"All we are doing, by using it in the aesthetics industry,\" she says, \"is enhancing something the body already does. That's why these are so special.\"\n\nBut they also come with a pretty hefty price tag.\n\nA single session of polynucleotide injections can cost anywhere from £200 to £500 - and it's recommended you have three of these over several weeks.\n\nAfter that clinics tend to advise you need to top up every six to nine months to maintain the look.\n\nBack at the clinic, Abby's treatment is almost finished.\n\n\"Just one area left,\" Helena Dunk, the aesthetic nurse practitioner who owns the clinic, Skin HD, reassures her.\n\nShe says polynucleotides have massively increased in popularity over the past 18 months.\n\n\"Half my clients really notice a huge difference - their skin feels more hydrated, healthier, younger - while the other half don't see such a big change. But their skin does tend to feel tighter and fresher.\"\n\nAbby has already had the area under her eyes injected as part of a three-course treatment at the clinic - and she's really pleased with the results.\n\nShe received lots of tiny injections of polynucleotides, which was a \"pretty painful procedure\", but says it's helped reduce the dark circles under her eyes.\n\nWhile a growing number of  studies consider it a safe and effective treatment , it is still relatively new and some experts warn the hype may be outpacing the science.\n\nConsultant dermatologist Dr John Pagliaro, based in Brisbane, Australia, says that while we know that nucleotides play an important role in our bodies - they are the building blocks of our DNA for a start - he questions whether \"injecting salmon DNA, cut into little pieces\" into our faces is going to work as well as our own nucleotides.\n\n\"We do not have good, strong data,\" he says. \"As a medical specialist, I would want to see at least a few more years of big, credible studies showing safety and efficacy before I started using them in my practice. We're just not there yet.\"\n\nCharlotte Bickley describes her foray into the world of polynucleotides as \"salmon-gate\".\n\nThe 31-year-old from New York had the treatment last year as part of her \"wedding glow up\", shortly before she was due to get married.\n\nBut Charlotte ended up with a skin infection, inflammation and darker rings under her eyes than before she had the treatment.\n\n\"I got the complete opposite of what I wanted,\" she says. \"I trusted that doctor, but he's left me scarred.\"\n\nCharlotte believes she was injected too deeply under her eyes, causing a negative reaction. There can be side effects - such as redness, swelling and bruising but these tend to be temporary.\n\nIn some cases, people can have an allergic reaction, or, if polynucleotides are not injected properly, there are longer term risks, such as skin pigmentation and infections.\n\nPolynucleotides are widely used across the UK. They are registered as medical devices with the Medicines Health and Regulatory Authority (MHRA) but they are not regulated like medicines.\n\nThey have not been approved by the UK’s equivalent in the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n\"I just keep thinking, 'Why did I go through with it?'\" Charlotte says. \"When something goes wrong on my face I hyperfixate on it.\"\n\nShe's paid thousands in medical bills to try to rectify the situation, but 10 months on, there's still some scarring below her eyes.\n\n\"I would never have salmon DNA injected into my face again,\" Charlotte says, \"ever.\"\n\nAshton Collins, director of Save Face, an organisation which campaigns for better regulation of the cosmetic industry and who runs a government-approved register of clinics in the UK, says polynucleotides are generally considered a safe treatment when administered by a medically-trained professional and the brand of polynucleotides used is from a reputable company.\n\n\"But, we are now seeing products coming onto the market that haven't been tested properly, that's the worry,\" she says.\n\nDr Sophie Shotter, president of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, agrees.\n\n\"Due to the lack of regulation, anyone can use products that have not been robustly tested. It is a real issue.\"\n\nIn her opinion, are polynucleotides effective though?\n\n\"I have them on my shelf, in my toolbox. I definitely offer them to clients, who want a natural look and want to potentially invest long-term,\" Dr Shotter says.\n\n\"Polynucleotides as a treatment is not the panacea. There are plenty of other treatments out there that can do similar, and have more data behind them.\"\n\nThere is no one treatment that will work for everyone, she adds.\n\n\"We all respond differently to different things, and that is not always predictable.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70930781r8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"22:36:49.994+00:00","title":"Titanic passenger's pocket watch fetches £1.78m at auction","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A gold pocket watch from Isidor Straus, a wealthy Titanic passenger and co-owner of Macy's, sold for a record £1.78 million at auction, symbolizing both personal sacrifice and enduring love.

blindsiding the House speaker and shocking Washington, will put a dent in Republicans’ already fragile majority, leaving them with a vacant seat at least into the spring.\n\nBut beyond the short-term practical impact, the sudden exit of Ms. Greene, the Georgia Republican who for years was one of the loudest MAGA voices in politics, has highlighted a deep well of discontent among far-right

Congress she said had squandered its opportunity to do anything of significance for the American people, much less enact the ultraconservative agenda that Mr. Trump had promised. She also predicted that Republicans would lose the House.\n\nThe “legislature has been mostly sidelined” over the last year, Ms. Greene said, noting that her proposals, including some to designate English as the official language of the United States, make it a felony to assist minors with gender transitions and eliminate visas for skilled foreign workers, “just sit collecting dust.”\n\nThat account was strikingly at odds with the Republican message going into next year’s elections, in which G.O.P. lawmakers plan to portray themselves as stewards of the president’s agenda who have delivered victories for voters.\n\nAnd in the wake of Ms. Greene’s announcement, other Republicans chimed in to echo her dissatisfaction with what their party has accomplished.\n\n“Unfortunately, there’s a lot of truth to what Marjorie had to say,” Representative Victoria Spartz, Republican of Indiana, said in a social media post. “I can’t blame her for leaving this institution that has betrayed the American people.”\n\nIn his own post, Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who routinely breaks with Mr. Trump, said of Ms. Greene’s farewell statement: “There’s more honesty expressed in these four pages than most politicians will speak in a lifetime.”\n\nMr. Trump celebrated the departure of Ms. Greene, whom he unendorsed last week, in a post on social media on Saturday in which he called her a “traitor” and took credit for chasing her out of Congress by threatening to run a primary opponent against her.\n\nBut her exit  — and the break between the two that preceded it — also underscored dissatisfaction in Mr. Trump’s base with parts of his agenda, and how at least some Republicans in Congress are beginning to look past him as the first signs of his lame duck status emerge.\n\nThat could be a big problem for Mr. Johnson, who has relied on the president’s stronghold over House Republicans to maintain order in the chamber during the first full year of his speakership.\n\nAfter all, Ms. Greene’s final major legislative effort was joining with Democrats — along with Mr. Massie and two other hard-right Republicans — to force a vote on a bill demanding that the Justice Department release all of its investigative files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Trump had worked for months to kill it before flipping to support it once passage appeared inevitable.\n\nIn the near term, Ms. Greene’s planned departure on Jan. 5 will not have much impact on Republicans’ bare-minimum majority. They can afford to lose no more than two defectors on a vote, and that will remain true once she has departed.\n\nBut her resignation will leave Republicans with at least one empty seat, likely until March, when a special election in Georgia to replace her is expected to be held, according to a state election official who spoke to Atlanta News First on Saturday.\n\nThe district is all but certain to elect a Republican to replace Ms. Greene, who won her seat with over 64 percent of the vote in 2024.\n\nA Tennessee special election slated for Dec. 2 to replace Representative Mark Green, a Republican who resigned in July, is largely considered an easy opportunity for the party to pick up another seat. But even as the G.O.P. candidate remains favored in that race, a strong push by Democrats has some Republicans sweating over the slight chance of an upset.\n\nThe speaker’s office said on Saturday that it was looking to that election and the 2026 midterms to firm up Republicans’ hold on the House, and dismissed the idea that Ms. Greene’s sudden and acrimonious exodus was a setback.\n\n“It doesn’t change anything,” Greg Steele, a political spokesman for Mr. Johnson and the National Republican Congressional Committee’s media affairs director, said in an interview. “We know it’s a tight majority, and we’re going to do everything we can to grow it in two weeks and then next year and beyond.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-republicans.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"16:21:49-05:00","title":"Trump Shows His Power, and Greene Reveals His Weakness","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The resignation of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a top MAGA loyalist, marks a turning point in Republican politics, signaling growing discontent with President Donald Trump’s leadership and the party’s direction.

2025-11-22T16:21:49-05:00\n\nJust when it appeared that President Trump’s hold over his party might be slipping, his most vocal Republican antagonist seemed to back away from the fight.\n\nThe shock resignation of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who transformed from the ultimate MAGA loyalist to a confounding critic of the president, showed that Mr. Trump remains both formidable and feared in Republican politics. Even as a lame-duck president, he is still able to exact retribution against conservative apostates and bring down onetime followers who dare to cross him.\n\nAt the same time, her departure represents far more than just another political notch in Mr. Trump’s belt: The defiant nature of her nearly 11-minute video announcement on Friday evening, which quickly went viral, hinted at the fissures now dividing the president’s movement.\n\nLaying out a laundry list of policy and political disagreements with Mr. Trump and the party establishment under him, she positioned herself as the true MAGA champion and declared that if she had been “cast aside,” then “many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”\n\nMs. Greene has always been a singular and idiosyncratic performer in Republican politics, but her discontent — and her desire to talk openly about what Mr. Trump’s party should stand for beyond unyielding allegiance to him — increasingly appears to be shared by some conservative officials and aspiring leaders.\n\nFrom the halls of Congress to the microphones of the manosphere, Republicans have been engaging in battles over policy, ideology and identity that could define the future of a movement shaped for a decade by Mr. Trump’s personality-driven politics.\n\nIn recent weeks, disagreements have surfaced across a wide array of urgent issues: possible military action in Venezuela and other foreign policy entanglements; the impact of tariffs and health care costs on the pocketbooks of voters; the release of the Epstein files; allowing legal immigration for highly skilled workers; continued miliary support for Israel; and whether to tolerate racial slurs and antisemitic language in their politics. Collectively, the conflicts represent the party’s biggest rift since Mr. Trump won the White House in 2016.\n\nSome of the disputes, like Ms. Greene’s, are rooted in frustration with Mr. Trump. Other clashes are efforts at political self-preservation as fears grow among congressional Republicans that the president’s unpopularity could hurt them in 2026 midterm contests.\n\nThe arguments amount to the first whispers of a far more complicated conversation: What will being Republican mean in an era no longer dominated by Mr. Trump?\n\nBeginning in Mr. Trump’s first term, a parade of traditional Republican lawmakers have been cast into exile for refusing to accept Mr. Trump’s conquest of their party. Ms. Greene is the first true believer to leave while arguing that the president has betrayed the founding principles of his supporters.\n\nHer departure may chiefly be aimed at avoiding an embarrassing political defeat. Ms Greene said she did not wish to endure a Trump-backed primary challenge in her deep-red district.\n\nBut the battle cry in her announcement, arguing that the Republican Party under Mr. Trump has lost its way, is a signal of how some conservatives are slowly imagining a future where his priorities, whims and vendettas no longer steer their movement.\n\nOther younger conservatives have also started flicking at that future.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who ran for president in 2024 and is now the leading Republican candidate for Ohio governor, declared in a speech last month that his party was at “a fork in the road.” Republicans would have to choose, he said, whether they stand for longstanding conservative ideals or right-wing identity politics focused on race, gender and national origin.\n\n“President Trump has done an incredible job of securing the border and delivering peace to the Middle East, and the question will soon turn to what comes next,” Mr. Ramaswamy said in an interview on Friday. “The future isn’t about what we’re against, it’s about what we stand for: colorblind meritocracy, the rule of law, capitalism and the American dream.”\n\nNot all pro-Trump Republicans agree with those principles.\n\nInfluential conservatives — including Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro and Steve Bannon — are feuding over support for Israel and the role in the party of the white nationalist Nick Fuentes. The drama has ensnared the Heritage Foundation, the party’s biggest think tank, which has faced infighting and resignations over a decision by its president to defend Mr. Carlson for a friendly interview with Mr. Fuentes.\n\nIn Congress, Republicans overcame Mr. Trump’s initial refusal to release the Epstein files and rejected his demand to gut the filibuster. In statehouses, Republicans in Indiana and Kansas have resisted White House pressure to redraw congressional lines.\n\nMr. Trump’s surprisingly cordial meeting on Friday with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani of New York City prompted howls of protest from some of the president’s loyalists, like Representative Elise Stefanik of New York and the right-wing influencer Laura Loomer.\n\nAnd on podcasts and conservative cable news, factions are pushing back against various Trump policies. Conservatives oppose providing H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrant workers, moderates in battleground districts are arguing against ending health insurance subsidies, and Republicans from farming states protested a plan to expand beef imports from Argentina.\n\n“As the architect of the MAGA movement, President Trump will always put America First,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.\n\nOther than Ms. Greene, almost no Republicans are offering an overt challenge to Mr. Trump, who still drives the agenda of not only their party but the entire political world. But the fractures are kick-starting the earliest discussion of a 2028 presidential race that is expected to be the first in 16 years not to include Mr. Trump. (The president is constitutionally limited from seeking a third term; he and some of his allies have floated that he could try to run again, though he has seemed to concede he cannot.)\n\nChristopher Rufo, a prominent conservative activist, said the party had moved into a period of “post-Trump politics,” with leading figures maneuvering for market share and ideological control.\n\nMuch of the jockeying, he said, is focused on Vice President JD Vance, who is widely considered a potential Trump heir.\n\n“This is a debate for the future of the Republican Party writ large, and it’s an influence campaign to try to recruit JD Vance toward one side or the other,” Mr. Rufo said. “People want to influence the vice president because they believe that they would be therefore influencing the next president.”\n\nMr. Vance has said he welcomes the discussion, though he has warned that intramural conflict could distract from attacking Democrats.\n\n“These debates should happen, they should happen in podcasts and they should happen in the media,” Mr. Vance told Breitbart News on Thursday. He added that Republicans must “have our debates, but focus on the enemy so that we can win victories that matter for the American people.”\n\nOther ambitious Republicans, cognizant of Mr. Trump’s passionate support among the conservative base, are wading into the discussion far more cautiously than Ms. Greene.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas has positioned himself as one of the party’s loudest voices denouncing antisemitism, pointedly criticizing Mr. Carlson and Mr. Fuentes. Mr. Cruz, who ran for president in 2016, says he is focused on maintaining the party’s traditional support for Israel — not on a 2028 run. But he has also made it clear that he is leaving his options open.\n\n“When Trump is not in the White House, what then?” Mr. Cruz asked this month at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual conference.\n\nHe chuckled and shrugged after a man in the audience shouted his name in response.\n\nEven some Democrats sense the shift.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna of California spent much of the spring focused on attacking Mr. Vance, whom he saw as the most likely heir to the Trump movement. Now, he said, the potential 2028 field seems far more fluid.\n\n“If you’d asked me three months ago, I would have said JD Vance is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party, and now, I think, it could be Marjorie Taylor Greene and it could be Marco Rubio and it could be someone we aren’t even talking about,” said Mr. Khanna, who is eyeing his own bid for the Democratic nomination. “They have gone from a consolidation around Trump to a serious consideration of a post-Trump future.”\n\nMr. Trump has largely rejected any idea that his party is moving on, arguing that his positions define what his movement supports.\n\n“I love my conservative friends, I love MAGA, but this is MAGA,” Trump insisted on Wednesday, as he defended H-1B visas before business executives.\n\nCharlie Gerow, a former vice chairman of the American Conservative Union, said Mr. Trump was experiencing a “slow devolving” of his power, opening the door to new figures who want to shape the future ideology of the party.\n\n“There’s a tug of war within the Republican Party, but the Trump team is a lot stronger within the party than any other faction,” Mr. Gerow said.\n\nStill despite Ms. Greene’s attempts to define the MAGA movement, it’s unclear what being a Republican will mean without Mr. Trump, said Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant and critic of the president.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump is gone, Mr. Madrid said, the coalition built by the president will not revert to the principles of fiscal conservatism, traditional social policy and a hawkish foreign policy that were the backbone of Republican ideology for generations.\n\n“We’re not going to wake up and there’s a hangover like we were on some eight-year bender and we’re all going to vote for George W. Bush again,” he said. “There’s no longer any policy, any philosophy that holds this all together.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85815r7m0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-23","timeOfPublication":"00:02:42.742+00:00","title":"Do mushroom and protein 'functional' coffees have health benefits?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing trend of 'functional coffee'—coffee infused with ingredients like mushrooms (lion's mane, reishi, chaga), protein, or collagen—aimed at offering benefits beyond caffeine, such as improved focus, energy stability, and stress support.

focused feeling\", without the \"spike and crash you can sometimes get from strong coffee\".\n\nCoffees made with extra ingredients like mushrooms, protein and collagen are known as \"functional coffees\" - which aim to provide consumers with benefits beyond the typical caffeine boost.\n\nFor years they've been a familiar sight in the aisles of health food stores, but more recently they've been cropping up in high street coffee shops too.\n\nSo when Zak opened his own coffee shop - Sipp in Chorlton, Greater Manchester - in late 2023, he was eager to include mushroom coffees on the menu.\n\nZak's shop has four different types of mushroom powder on its menu, which he says all have different benefits. Customers can pay an extra £1 to add a mushroom powder or a supplement called collagen to drinks from lattes to cappuccinos.\n\nCoffee made with mushrooms, like lion's mane, reishi and chaga, are believed to give people better focus \"without the jitters of regular coffee\", according to nutritionist Eli Brecher, though she notes that research is still ongoing.\n\nOver the past year as demand has risen, health food chain Holland and Barrett has almost doubled its range of mushroom coffees, it told the BBC.\n\nCoffee giant Starbucks started selling barista-made protein coffee in its US stores in September, with high-protein milk and cold foam. In the UK, you can pick up a bottle of Starbucks' pre-made protein coffee from the fridges at its coffee shops and in supermarkets, where it might be sold alongside chilled protein coffees by other brands such as Jimmy's and Emmi.\n\nFood research company Tastewise lists functional coffee as one of its top trends for 2026. It found the number of mushroom coffees on UK coffee shop menus has grown 30% over the past year.\n\n\"Functional coffees are shifting from niche wellness corners into the mainstream,\" says Ms Brecher, who herself drinks mushroom coffee. She says people are becoming \"much more interested in wellbeing, stress support and energy stability\", and that adding extra ingredients to a cup of coffee \"feels like an easy upgrade, rather than an overhaul\".\n\nThe Black Sheep Coffee chain has been offering scoops of protein powder and CBD as add-ons to its drinks for some time, but earlier this year, it launched its \"functional health\" latte range.\n\nOne, containing prebiotic fibres, aims to improve gut health. Another, with collagen, is meant to help people's skin. But it's the lion's mane latte that is Black Sheep's bestseller, according to Ben Fenton, their chief operating officer. And customer response to the drink has been \"far beyond\" what the company expected.\n\nCustomers add functional add-ons to about 15% of all coffee, matcha and smoothie orders from Black Sheep, he says.\n\nPrices vary by location but at Black Sheep Coffee in Birmingham, adding a shot of lion's mane to your coffee costs 99p, and a shot of collagen costs £1.09. So if you buy a functional coffee every day, rather than your regular one, over the course of a month you'll spend about £30 more.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US Starbucks customers are paying $1 (76p) to add high-protein milk or $2 (£1.52) to add high-protein cold foam to their coffee.\n\nAt Liverpool Street Station in London, not everyone I speak to seems enticed by the idea of paying extra for a functional coffee. And many say they haven't come across the concept of coffees made with ingredients like mushrooms and ashwagandha - a herb some people think helps with stress - before.\n\nSomeone who is well-aware of the trend, however, is Mariam Begum.\n\nEvery day, the 31-year-old drinks coffee with a shot of  collagen , a protein some people take in supplement form because they believe it will help their skin, joints and hair. And sometimes Mariam adds protein powder, too.\n\nThe self-described caffeine addict drinks three or four coffees a day. She'll either make them at home with collagen she's bought online or grab an iced coffee or flat white with collagen or protein from a coffee shop   near where she lives in London.\n\nUnlike Mariam, Lauren Devlin, a former competitive power-lifter, has never bought a functional coffee from a cafe, but says she would if she ever saw them on a menu - even if she had to pay more.\n\nFor years, she's been drinking both coffee and protein shakes every day. But about five years ago, the 38-year-old started combining the two.\n\nShe now buys instant coffee containing collagen and protein powder online to make at home, which she says makes her \"feel fuller\" than a regular coffee.\n\nSo how does functional coffee actually taste? I ordered a lion's mane coffee with oat milk from Black Sheep, dubbed its \"brain blend\", alongside a regular oat-milk latte.\n\nAndrew Salter, cofounder of mushroom drinks brand Dirtea, says lion's mane in particular has a subtle taste, and I found there was next to no difference between my functional coffee and the regular one. The mushroom latte was possibly slightly more bitter, but my perception may have been affected because I was expecting it to taste different. The texture and appearance of both coffees seemed identical.\n\nThere's still a lot of confusion about the purpose of functional coffee -  Mr Salter says when he set up his brand \"99.9% of people asked if they were going to get high\". But the mushrooms used in coffees, like lion's mane, are a different species to magic mushrooms and aren't psychoactive.\n\nSome who regularly drink functional coffees speak highly of their benefits.\n\nAna Richardson, who lives in Cardiff, says lion's mane coffee made her feel like her brain \"just started working\" and it was easier to focus on one thing at a time after drinking it.\n\nBut the 29-year-old, who ordered lion's mane online to add to coffees at home, found it expensive and switched to drinking lion's mane tincture mixed into water instead.\n\nRecently, Ana has also tried coffee with ashwagandha.\n\n\"I'm awake, but I'm not jittery,\"  she says of the drink. \"I'm not anxious.\"\n\nResearch into the effect of lion's mane's on brain function is still in its early stages, but  it is \"promising\", according to nutritional therapist Rakhi Lad. But she notes most mushroom coffees on the high street use small quantities of lion's mane, and that the quality can vary.\n\nAs for protein coffee, the general population \"doesn't really struggle\" to get enough protein, says James Fleming, professor of sports nutrition at St Mary's University. In general, only the elderly and professional athletes need to worry about adding extra protein to their diets, he explains.\n\nThe health benefits of functional coffees \"vary quite a lot and for most people, they're not essential,\" says Bini Suresh, from the British Dietetics Association. Often the doses of functional ingredients in coffees \"are too low to replicate the effects reported in research trials\", she adds.\n\n\"At present, there's no robust evidence that lion's mane in typical coffee doses can meaningfully improve memory, focus, or brain health.\"\n\nBut the research is \"still emerging\", says nutritionist Eli Brecher.\n\n\"So if it makes you feel good and you have the budget for it, then go ahead and enjoy,\" she says. \"But the key is to remember that it's an add-on - not a magic fix.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/climate/cop30-climate-summit-ends-belem.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"11:58:21-05:00","title":"Climate Talks End With Dire Warnings and Scant Plans for Action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate talks in Brazil ended with a weak resolution that avoids addressing fossil fuels, despite urgent warnings about climate inaction.

ended on Saturday in Brazil with a watered-down resolution that makes no mention of fossil fuels, the main driver of global warming.\n\nThe final statement included plenty of warnings on the cost of inaction but few provisions for how the world might address dangerously rising global temperatures head-on.\n\nA marathon series of frenetic Friday night meetings ultimately salvaged the talks in Belém, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. The meeting had teetered on the brink of total collapse, with oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia adamant that their key export not be singled out.\n\nThey were joined by many African and Asian countries that argued, as they have in earlier talks, that Western countries bear unique responsibility in paying for climate change because they are responsible for most historic greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAfter the gavel fell, André Corrêa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat leading the talks, announced that his country would lead an independent effort to rally nations to develop specific plans for transitioning away from fossil fuels and for protecting tropical forests. The political effort would have no force of international law but won a round of applause from delegates.\n\nBut the weak deal heightened fears among many countries, particularly vulnerable island states, that the world is politically unwilling or unable to address climate change and its cascade of accompanying catastrophes\n\nThe talks, known as COP30, were inauspicious from the get-go.\n\nThe U.S. government under President Trump effectively boycotted the annual gathering, thumbing its nose at multilateral climate action while simultaneously revving up the American fossil fuel industry and repealing federal support for renewable energy and electric vehicles. It was the first time in 30 years of climate talks that the United States had not attended.\n\nAnd yet, in many ways, the disappointment of the summit was a result of America’s absence. While the United States under Democratic administrations has not always been a champion of ambitious climate action, it had consistently succeeded in one thing: Demanding that major economies with high greenhouse gas emissions, like China and Saudi Arabia, take on more responsibility. Without the United States, diplomats in Belém acknowledged, that enormous source of pressure was gone.\n\n“The U.S. has harmed itself by taking itself out of the process,” said David Waskow, who leads the climate program at the World Resources Institute, a research group. “It’s not here to push a number of other economies. For example, China.”\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, declined to comment on the outcome of the talks, but said in a statement that Mr. Trump “has set a strong example for the rest of the world” by pursuing new fossil fuel development. ”President Trump has been clear,” she said. “He will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”\n\nChina, currently the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter by far, played a limited role in Belém, choosing not to step into the leadership vacuum created by the absence of the United States.\n\nDespite dominating the world’s clean energy industry, China avoided strong positions on most, if not all, of the main sticking points at the talks: reducing emissions, providing money to help poorer countries cope with climate change and contributions to a new Brazilian fund aimed at stemming deforestation. At China’s urging, the deal calls for nations to not use climate as an excuse to restrict international trade.\n\nThe mild resolution was also a rebuff of Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who had billed the event as a historic moment to make progress on climate action while showcasing the Amazon, often called the “lungs of the world” for the huge amount of planet-warning carbon dioxide the forest pulls out of the atmosphere.\n\nIn a speech that opened the talks, he called for negotiators to deliver a “road map” for a global transition away from fossil fuels. In the end, there was no such plan.\n\nAt talks two years ago in Dubai, the nations of the world already agreed on a “transition away” from fossil fuels by the middle of this century. Heeding President Lula’s suggestion, a group of countries — including Britain, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany and Kenya — had pushed in Belém for a detailed plan.\n\nA simple acknowledgment of the Dubai deal is all they got. The deal says countries should implement their climate plans “taking into account the decisions” made in Dubai. Europeans said the language, while coded, was still a win.\n\n“We know that it is very difficult for many countries, like oil-producing countries, that have been very vocal against it,” said Maria da Graça Carvalho, Portugal’s environment minister. “It was the best we could get to have this reference.”\n\nNegotiators from the European Union had argued particularly for inclusion of language around fossil fuels, but a wide range of developing countries maintained that it was more important for Western countries to pledge larger amounts of money to help poorer ones cope with the already-mounting costs of global warming.\n\nThat responsibility, they said, should fall largely on European countries and the United States because of their giant contributions to greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution began. The United States alone accounts for roughly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions to date.\n\nAli Mohamed, Kenya’s climate envoy, said that financial obligations from rich countries to poor ones “cannot remain afterthoughts for a continent responsible for less than 4 percent of global emissions.”\n\nPresident Lula’s signature anti-deforestation initiative, the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, also fell far short of his ambitious goal of raising $25 billion in public financing that would essentially pay countries to protect forests. By the end of the talks, the program had received around $5 billion in pledges from a small handful of countries including Norway, Indonesia and France, with Germany saying it would soon contribute an unspecified amount.\n\nThere was one win for vulnerable countries. The deal did bolster promises of funding to protect communities from the impacts of climate-fueled disasters. Small island nations in particular wanted more assurances that nations would triple adaptation finance, and the final agreement does that, calling for “efforts to at least triple adaptation finance by 2035.”\n\nExhausted delegates had long trips home ahead of them. Belém, while vibrant, was an incredibly expensive and hard-to-reach venue for negotiators from other continents. The city also lacked enough accommodations for the roughly 50,000 attendees, and many slept on two European cruise ships brought to Belém as temporary hotels, while others made makeshift arrangements with locals to sleep in their apartments.\n\nThe two cruise ships were scheduled to depart on Saturday, increasing pressure on diplomats to finish the deal. Others found themselves unable to delay their departures because so few flights leave from Belém each day.\n\nThe purpose-built event space was only completed in the days before negotiators arrived. Near-daily torrential rains buffeted its flimsy walls, and as water poured into negotiating rooms, deafening claps of thunder raised goose bumps. On Thursday, as negotiations headed into their most intense final stretch, a fire broke out. The venue was evacuated, 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation and negotiators resorted to shuttle diplomacy, not between their offices at the conference but in Uber rides between one another’s hotels.\n\nIn the end, the talks were stymied by the widening gulf between the world’s biggest emitters and the poorest, most vulnerable countries that are pleading for a more ambitious collective response to climate change.\n\n“I couldn’t say we’re happy, but we are giving thanks that in this geopolitical climate that we have not regressed,” said Ruleta Camacho Thomas, who represented Antigua and Barbuda at the talks. “We had hoped that the evidence of what is actually happening on our islands would have been enough to leverage more support.”\n\nTen years ago at landmark climate talks near Paris, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep the average increase in global temperature to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and preferably closer to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with preindustrial levels.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made, the “well below” 2 degree goal is almost certain to not be met, given a decade of sluggish action. Based on policies that countries have put in place and current technology trends, Earth is expected to warm by roughly 2.8 degrees Celsius this century, compared with preindustrial levels, according to the latest U. N. calculations.\n\nEmissions have increased significantly since the Paris Agreement. Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is on track to hit a record high this year. The world has already warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius since late 19th-century averages.\n\nScientists have repeatedly warned that each tenth of a degree of warming makes the climate both less predictable — with enormous ramifications for agriculture, urban planning and global supply chains — as well as more prone to extremes like droughts, floods and wildfires, which are deepening humanitarian crises and driving waves of migration.\n\nThen there are the tipping points: irreversible changes that global warming can set in motion, potentially including the destabilization of ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica. That could push sea levels dangerously higher for coastal communities around the world.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/world/europe/russia-visas-ukraine.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"00:01:05-05:00","title":"Russian Exiles See Europe Visa Rule as Blow Against Them, Not Putin","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The European Union has implemented a new visa policy restricting Russian tourists from obtaining multiple-entry visas, replacing them with single-entry visas valid for one year per visit.

2025-11-22T00:01:05-05:00\n\nThe European Union’s decision to stop issuing Russian tourist visas that allow for multiple visits has provoked both alarm and outrage among Russians living in exile.\n\nThe E.U. said the decision was prompted by a string of sabotage attacks in Europe, but Russian exiles say Europe is punishing ordinary Russians rather than taking real steps that would impede the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine, like stopping purchases of the country’s oil and gas.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, who died last year in an Arctic prison, weighed in this week with a video statement, saying that while Europe had every right to decide who gets a visa, the measure would do little to deter President Vladimir V. Putin or to stop the war.\n\n“How will this measure help?” Ms. Navalnaya said in the video released Tuesday on X. “Putin has sent his saboteurs and will continue to send them. They will get a single-entry visa, or enter on a diplomatic passport, or on a third-country passport. No problem. Are you trying to fight the problem or just to pretend to fight it?”\n\nThe European Union called the visa limitation, which it issued  this month, a security measure. In recent months, various forms of low-level aggression blamed on Russia have rattled capitals, including drone incursions; incendiary devices found in cargo terminals; Baltic cables being severed and cyberattacks.\n\nNow, Russians seeking to enter Europe must apply for a new visa, valid for one year, for each entry, with some exceptions for activists. Previously, multiple-entry visas were good for five years.\n\nReviewing visa applications for each entry will allow for “a close and frequent scrutiny of the applicants to mitigate any security risks,” Markus Lammert, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in announcing the new measures.\n\nVisas for Russians have been a contentious issue since February 2022, when the Russian army launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Apart from the general guidelines, E.U. states can set their own restrictions, and most bordering directly on Russia stopped issuing tourist visas years ago.\n\nSome E.U. members, including Germany, gave special status to humanitarian visas. But InTransit, an organization that helps Russians in danger flee, said Germany quietly stopped issuing those last May, with about 50 people stuck in limbo.\n\nThe rules implemented since the outbreak of the war had already reduced the number of European visas issued to Russians to around 500,000 in 2023, down from four million in 2019, Mr. Lammert said.\n\nAside from security concerns, some European officials have argued that it was unseemly to see Russians shopping on the Champs-Élysées or slaloming through Gstaad while their country was at war.\n\nIn September, Kaja Kallas, the E.U.’s top foreign policy official and a former prime minister of Estonia, called for a complete visa ban for Russians, saying, “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right.”\n\nSergey Lagodinsky, a member of the European Parliament from Germany’s Green Party who works extensively with Russian activists, said he did not understand why screening ordinary tourists should create such a furor, especially since other countries face the same rules. “What’s the problem? Why the hysteria?” he wrote on Facebook, prompting a torrent of objections from Russians about splitting families, residency problems and other issues.\n\nCritics pointed out that many of those arrested for acts of sabotage in Europe have turned out to be local citizens recruited by Russia, often online.\n\nThe Russian government tends to use such restrictions to suggest that Russians are better off staying home rather than experiencing what it calls Western “Russophobia,” without mentioning the war it started. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the foreign minister, told reporters that any threat from Russia was “mythical” and economic damage from limiting Russian tourism would be “another self-inflicted wound” for Europe.\n\nThe new rules carved out exceptions, including for family members of E.U. citizens or legal residents. Multiple-entry visas can still be issued to dissidents, independent journalists, human rights defenders and representatives of civil society organizations. They were already rare, activists said, and the application took months, so the process is expected to get even harder.\n\nMore important, limiting extended visas to activists will mark recipients as “foreign agents” in the eyes of the Russian security services, activists said.\n\nAnyone in those categories who stayed in Russia now faces a stark choice, wrote Elena Kostyuchenko, a renowned Russian journalist and the victim of an apparent poisoning while living in exile. They can, she said in a post on social media, either leave now and abandon their work, or continue, knowing that they will face even more hurdles if they need to flee.\n\nOverall, activists said, the new rules will make it harder for those who fled to Europe to stay in touch with their families in Russia, and will also complicate life for activists still in Russia who might need to escape or who simply want to stay in touch with their funders, who are often in Europe. It is just one more form of repression, one more blow toward opposition groups, said the coordinator of InTransit.\n\nMilana Mazaeva contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/opinion/epstein-women-victims-politics.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-04","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00.000Z","title":"US Initiates New Military Operation to Counter Escalating Regional Threats","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has launched a new military operation to counter escalating threats from a neighboring country, involving joint exercises with allied forces and the deployment of advanced surveillance equipment.

But as the Opinion columnist Lydia Polgreen and the contributing Opinion writer Molly Jong-Fast remind listeners, this is a case about the “conspiracy of silence” that perpetuates sexual violence against women. In this episode, the two writers explore the intertwining paths of the Epstein saga and the #MeToo movement, the challenges of accountability and whether this moment could mark a change for American culture and politics.\n\nBelow is a transcript of an episode of “The Opinions.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nLydia Polgreen: Molly, you just came back from D.C., where you were at a press conference of Epstein survivors on Tuesday. We’re taping this on Wednesday morning. So I wanted to talk to you about where the Epstein saga sits in the broader arc of #MeToo and the movement that has stumbled along the way, and what it says that three of the four Republican members of Congress who first broke ranks with Trump were all women.\n\nBefore we get into the broader context, let’s talk about the press event that you went to. It sounds like it was quite a scene.\n\nMolly Jong-Fast: So I think it’s worth pulling back and looking at Tuesday. Tuesday was a day that, for Donald Trump, was right out of “Macbeth.” We saw a president who had successfully gotten away with a lot of stuff and all of a sudden, Jeffrey Epstein, like Banquo’s ghost, comes back. Trump is hanging out with Mohammed bin Salman, doing a press conference in his golden Oval Office, and at the same time these women are doing a press conference right outside of the Cannon building — and you have this ghost of a story that has come back once again.\n\nNow, the discharge petition goes right through the House that same day, and it goes to the Senate and it passes the Senate, and it is a very sort of Shakespearean moment of a problem that Donald Trump had, and we don’t know how big a problem. We don’t really know what’s in those files. So he certainly behaves like someone who does not want those files to be released. It comes back to him, and it’s a very cinematic and also morally important and atrocious moment.\n\nPolgreen: One of the things that’s really striking about this whole saga is that this has been going on now for two decades. Jeffrey Epstein first kind of gets into legal trouble about 20 years ago. He does a little bit of time, very soft time. And this was all before the #MeToo movement started — the #MeToo movement, I should say, became a big public phenomenon with the exposure and, ultimately, the downfall of Harvey Weinstein, thanks to reporting by some of our colleagues.\n\nThe scope and scale of the Epstein crisis coming at a moment when it seems as though there is this kind of sentiment that #MeToo has gone too far, you know, that men weren’t being allowed to be men. So it’s been really interesting to see the way that this whole case has unfolded and the politics around it have unfolded. How have you seen the #MeToo of it all as you’ve watched this happening?\n\nJong-Fast: Well, that was why I thought we should talk, was because I think of you as someone who is also following this — like these rapid cycles of progress and reversal, and progress, reversal, progress and reversal. So the moment I would take away from that press conference was one of the survivors, and I think it’s Annie Farmer, talked about how she and her sister had called the F.B.I. under Clinton and said, We have this thing we want to report, that they had hung up on her. And it was just, for me, the sheer magnitude of different administrations, different parties, all having been in some way responsible for an F.B.I. that did not take these women seriously.\n\nTape of Annie Farmer:  In 1996, when my sister Maria bravely blew the whistle on this group by reporting to the F.B.I. what Epstein and Maxwell did to both of us, they hung up the phone on her, and there was no follow-up of any kind. Bill Clinton was president. In 2006, the F.B.I. came to us, finally interviewed us, and asked us both to be witnesses against Epstein. We were very anxious, but we agreed. And then we didn’t hear back from them due to their infamous sweetheart deal. George W. Bush was president. In 2015, when the D.O.J. was sent a FOIA request for Maria’s F.B.I. files, and they were denied, as they have been many times, Barack Obama was president. In 2019, when Epstein died in prison due to either negligence or foul play, Donald Trump was president.\n\nAnd she said: I think of all the people, all the girls who got hurt during the period when we were trying to raise the alarm.\n\nPolgreen: Yeah, I mean, that’s one of the things that has really struck me about the Epstein case and about #MeToo more generally, is a lot of people think about #MeToo as starting with Harvey Weinstein.\n\nJong-Fast: Right.\n\nPolgreen: And that kind of opened the floodgates. But in fact, #MeToo was first popularized by Tarana Burke, who is a Black American activist. And it was inspired by the many conversations that she had with teenage girls about the terrible experiences they had with sexual abuse and harassment. What that really highlights for me is that so much of this conversation about Epstein and about this vast conspiracy of pedophilia — you think about controversies like Pizzagate, and the QAnon belief that there were powerful Democratic leaders who were trafficking children out of a pizzeria in Washington, but all of that obscures the fact that sexual exploitation of girls and teenagers in this country is endemic.\n\nSurely it happens among power brokers, but I think for most people, their connection to a situation like this is actually something that they’ve witnessed in their own life. And the conspiracy feels more like a conspiracy of silence of powerful men, wherever they happen to find themselves. Like the powerful man might be the head of a family, or it might be the head of a company or of a small business.\n\nJong-Fast: Right. Your boss at the Taco Bell — there’s a power dynamic there.\n\nPolgreen: Exactly. So I think that one of the reasons that — I mean, it’s just really striking to me that #MeToo took off once it became clear that this broader societal problem that was bubbling below the surface starts to be written about at the very top of society, talking about the big power brokers. And I think there’s something similar happening with Epstein.\n\nI’m really struck by the fact that three of the four Republicans who signed on were all women. And two of the three have spoken publicly about their own experiences, in the case of Nancy Mace, of sexual assault and domestic violence. For Lauren Boebert, definitely domestic violence. And for Marjorie Taylor Greene, I think a sense that in this kind of chauvinistic Washington, she’s being pushed around, she’s getting belittled, she’s told what she can and can’t do — and I don’t want to read too much into it. But you sort of have to think, like, these are women of a certain age who have ——\n\nJong-Fast: Our age.\n\nPolgreen: Our age, exactly — who know what the score is and have surely seen in their own lives, their own friends, their own communities, case after case of teenage girls who’ve been exploited or been pressured into having a relationship with a man who’s too old for them. All those kinds of things that we know, all the way up to horrific childhood sexual abuse. So I think that there’s something about this saga and the role of these three women that is just totally fascinating. It just delves into this thing that connects it to people’s life experience.\n\nJong-Fast: And it’s funny because as someone who covers politicians, I have become so cynical of everyone’s motives. Especially over the last decade of Trumpism, it’s hard to think that these people want what’s best for anyone. Really, honestly.\n\nPolgreen: That they don’t have some cynical ulterior motive, that it’s about preserving their own power or whatever.\n\nJong-Fast: Exactly. Especially Marjorie Taylor Greene, who really did say a lot of crazy stuff over the last eight years.\n\nPolgreen: And has some very odious beliefs. Right?\n\nJong-Fast: Very! But what I do think is interesting is when I was there, you could see that these victims feel very connected with Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nPolgreen: Huh, that’s fascinating.\n\nJong-Fast: Yeah. I mean, you really could see — because they’re not faking it. In fact, one of them was like: I voted for Trump and you’ve betrayed me. Not quite that, but basically that, and so they were not faking it. And the other thing that I want to mention about the victims is: these women, and remember, there are probably hundreds of women — I mean, this was years and years of abuse. But these women had not been together before. So that first press conference, when the discharge petition got started, they had a real camaraderie, and they started talking about reading a list. They talked about it again on Tuesday. I haven’t seen any reporting about this, but one of the victims said, you know, Marjorie said she’ll read a list of our names, and Representative Pramila Jayapal said she would, too.\n\nSo there really is an appetite for information. So even if the Trump D.O.J., which really does serve at the pleasure of Donald Trump at this moment — as you can tell from Pam Bondi’s general acquiescence on every point — these names, there really is a feeling these names are getting read.\n\nPolgreen: So there’s a kind of desire to put this out into the world and make it into something that’s part of the congressional record. That’s part of the overall sweep of these events.\n\nAnd just coming back to these three Republican women in Congress, they really were under a tremendous amount of pressure. And given the level of pressure that they’re under, it’s remarkable that they held up. But it’s also interesting to me to think about the arc of #MeToo and the arc of how we went from this moment where there was this tremendous pressure for accountability and then, quite quickly, a feeling that it had gone too far.\n\nJong-Fast: Yeah, quite quickly.\n\nPolgreen: And admittedly, the gamut of people who got caught up in #MeToo, there were truly onerous ogres, like ——\n\nJong-Fast: Harvey Weinstein.\n\nPolgreen: Like Harvey Weinstein, or you look at somebody like Kevin Spacey, who very clearly had a long track record of if not criminal behavior, then very serious harassment against young male actors over many years. But then, as time progresses and it starts to catch up with figures like Al Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota and former comedian — I guess he’s still a comedian — and Aziz Ansari, that was one of the most edge cases that I think turned a lot of people off #MeToo.\n\nIt’s funny because I do think — you mentioned this earlier — there is this kind of cyclical nature to these things where there’s accountability, there’s a sense that this cannot go on. And then there’s a backlash. So where do you think we are in this cycle?\n\nJong-Fast: Yeah, it’s such a good point. I had for a long time believed that this was the nature of modern life and technology, and that it was the failing of tech. I don’t know why. I had this whole theory in my head that it was a failure of technology. But I actually now think, if you think about the book “Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,” Susan Faludi’s seminal Bible of the sort of war against feminism. I mean, I actually was rereading it again.\n\nPhyllis Schlafly and the Equal Rights Amendment: I feel like that’s a very similar story, in a way. The Equal Rights Amendment, a piece of legislation that would have guaranteed women equal rights, and the pushback to that and those years where they had passed it through the Congress but couldn’t get it ratified by the states. There was this concerted effort by conservative women to show that they didn’t need it. And I feel like there — it feels like a similar kind of pushback to movement.\n\nI don’t want to be wrong, and I feel like whenever you want to try to predict the future or whenever I predict the future, I’m always wrong. I’m always told that predicting the future is bad podcasting. But that said, now I’ll predict the future: It does feel like an important moment.\n\nPolgreen: And I think that what’s crucial is in these moments, they need to be able to connect to the experiences that ordinary people have in their own lives. It’s not just about the shadowy group of financiers and media moguls and elite university professors who have this kind of old boys network who are helping each other out at the highest levels of society.\n\nThis is something that’s happening in every social context. And all of that is happening kind of silently. The women who are experiencing it are like: Oh, wait, it’s happening there too. And that I think — again, #MeToo, that was the kind of origin and momentum of the movement.\n\nJong-Fast: I want to ask you a question.\n\nPolgreen: Yeah.\n\nJong-Fast: So I think there’s an element to this which is privilege, and I’m going to tell a very quick story. During #MeToo, a friend of mine said, well, no one ever #MeToo-ed me. And I said: You come from a fancy family; nobody’s going to #MeToo you because they know your mom. And I wondered: When you look at these victims, like, one was picked up at Mar-a-Lago for massage, or she was a spa attendant ——\n\nPolgreen: Virginia Giuffre.\n\nJong-Fast: Virginia was a 16-year-old spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago. These women were disenfranchised enough so they didn’t have a powerful mom they could call.\n\nPolgreen: Yeah, yeah. And I think that that’s a huge part of the story. Again, this connects back to the ubiquity and just how common this kind of sexual exploitation is of young women. Again, not by fancy rich people, although that certainly happens, but by people that are close to them.\n\nI think there have been a number of stories that have come out about how these teenage girls who ended up in Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein’s clutches had previous experiences of being exploited. Again, not by somebody with a private island and a Manhattan townhouse, but by somebody close to them. And that is sort of the painful reality of how these things work.\n\nI want to talk a little bit about this question of accountability, because I think there’s been this sense that Trump never ultimately pays a price for what he does. He’s Teflon Don. He always manages to get away with it. Do you think this time will be different?\n\nJong-Fast: So it’s funny because if you think about Epstein in 2007, it looks like the walls are closing in, and then he signs this nonprosecution agreement with Alex Acosta. In 2008, he does a year in couture jail where he basically sort of walks in, walks out — he’s doing this, he’s doing that. It’s in Palm Beach. I think that’s the way it works with a lot of powerful men. I would say people, but it’s really men. Because even powerful women, they tend to get held accountable. I’m thinking about Martha Stewart and James Comey. A lot of people would not have gone to jail for what Martha Stewart went to jail for.\n\nA lot of powerful men, it’s like — sometimes the process is imperfect, but eventually it happens. And when Trump was out of office, he did end up adjudicated by E. Jean Carroll. He did end up owing millions of dollars.\n\nSo I do think that this accountability thing — it happens; sometimes it takes a couple of pushes. I also am not a person who believes that the arc of history just stops. I think it keeps going.\n\nPolgreen: And it’s kind of gross because the answer to the question of should there be accountability should just be yes. Rather than who’s going to get hurt? Which side is going to get more hurt by it?\n\nBut there’s been a lot of talk about Epstein and the circles that he ran in, that this is actually going to affect more Democrats than it is Republicans. I mean, I don’t know about that. But I have a slightly different view, which is that I think it’ll actually be a really good thing if this whole network and constellation of powerful men who are part of this, in varying degrees — some of them not criminal, some of them just creepy, some of them just really bad judgment. I think if all of those figures, regardless of what their politics are, are swept away and pushed into retirement and sent off to live out the last of their days in some kind of shame, that that would not necessarily be a bad thing.\n\nAnd I would say it’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially for the Democratic Party. You need this renewal. You need new figures who are untouched, who were never part of these awful power games and networks that they used to play. I almost think of it as being a little bit like the dividing line between Democrats who opposed the Iraq war and those who voted for it. It’s an imperfect analogy, obviously, a different situation. But I think that there was something really healthy about that, becoming, in effect, a kind of litmus test to have a clear moral point of view about whether the Iraq war was a huge mistake or not.\n\nSo I don’t know. Thinking about accountability lessons, like who goes to jail and more in terms of how our culture and politics shift at the end of this? I don’t know. That feels like a real possibility coming out of this.\n\nJong-Fast: It’s funny because we’re friends besides being colleagues. And I always think of you as a person who has, in their head, moral questions — I mean, nobody is perfect, but who in their head is constantly sort of thinking of the moral implications of things. Which I hope that’s not — I hope this is not my own fantasy of you. And I too am often. Not because I’m so great, but because I got sober when I was 19, and so I’m always thinking about the moral implications of something: Will this make you feel so bad that ultimately you’ll start drinking? That kind of thing.\n\nAnd so you have to wonder, like, these people all knew: He was on the registered sex offender website. Because I remember I once found the app and I was looking at it and I pushed Central Park and he came up. So he was a registered sex offender on the registry.\n\nPolgreen: Who lived not that far from you?\n\nJong-Fast: Not that far, no.\n\nPolgreen: And your kids?\n\nJong-Fast: Yes, and my kids. Though, of course, they never would have gone for any of the kids who were private school kids.\n\nPolgreen: Yeah, of course.\n\nJong-Fast: Because they knew that they couldn’t. And that I think is such an important point. You and I both, I think, want to talk about the layers of privilege and wealth. The one thing that Donald Trump, I think, ever said that was a benefit to society was: The system is rigged. And of course he wanted to rig it more for himself, but about that one thing he was correct. But I do think the moral question of whether you are going to the home of someone who’s a registered sex offender, like the Woody Allen dinner parties — you have to know.\n\nPolgreen: Yeah, there’s no denying it, that you know. It’s clear that some of the people involved here chose to stay in warm and affectionate contact with Epstein long after they knew. And that, I think, is where ultimately the accountability is just going to be undeniable. And I say: Sweep them all away.\n\nJong-Fast: Yeah, I do, too. I also agree with that point. You know, Bill Clinton’s in there. Bill Clinton was president in the 1990s and it was a very different time for how we think about powerful men.\n\nPolgreen: Oh, yeah. Obviously, and you know, our mutual friend Monica Lewinsky has lots to say about that.\n\nJong-Fast: Yes. She really does.\n\nPolgreen: You obviously have had a lot of conversations and talked to a lot of people, and there is this sense that this Epstein saga has split Donald Trump’s coalition in a way that nothing else has. Why do you think that is? What is it about this particular story that has led to such a profound cleavage?\n\nJong-Fast: So I think it’s two parts. One is that they were radicalized on Pizzagate. In 2016, when Donald Trump was running for office, WikiLeaks kept releasing these emails. I actually went back and looked this up: emails from John Podesta to his brother Tony about pizza, and he was talking about a walnut sauce, because they’re both big cooks. And these emails were interpreted to be child sex trafficking.\n\nThis was the very beginning of Trumpism, right before Trump got elected the first time. So I think you had a base that had an origin story that was: Donald Trump is going to end a sex trafficking ring. Then fast-forward to QAnon 2020. Trump is making overtures toward QAnon when he’s running for re-election. He’s saying the storm is coming. QAnon, again, a follow-up of Pizzagate — there is a cabal of sex-trafficking powerful men and that Trump is going to bring them down.\n\nHere we are, fast-forward, we are in 2025. There is actually — yeah, it’s a cabal. There’s a cabal of powerful men. There’s a ringleader: Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine. But there clearly are many people — who are, I think, mostly men — who are doing this. And so you have a base that’s radicalized on an origin story that turns out to be true.\n\nPolgreen: That’s that classic line, right? Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you. Sometimes conspiracies turn out to be true; it’s just that instead of using obscure, coded language of walnut sauce and pies, it’s very direct: I’m trying to hook up with this hot lady. Jeffrey, what’s your advice? And there is something sort of sad and banal and, frankly, kind of tragic about that.\n\nJong-Fast: And speaking of sad and banal, the other thing I would say, just as an underlying thing: I personally would be more gratified if it were a return of #MeToo that dissected the MAGA movement, if it were women’s rights that came in and did it. But you have to realize that what’s also bubbling below the surface is a movement that has been promised for about 10 years, that Trump was going to make things cheaper. And he hasn’t. In fact, things have gotten more expensive. And that he was going to do things like bring back coal jobs and bring back manufacturing.\n\nSo some of this is — as much as in my own belief system I would like it to be that finally the women are winning, there’s also, I think, an underlying dissatisfaction that is stoking the flames.\n\nPolgreen: Well, Molly, I think we should leave it there. Thank you so much for talking with me. It was great to see you.\n\nJong-Fast: It was so great. Thank you for having me.\n\nThoughts?

Discuss Support for Ukraine in Response to U.S. Peace Plan\n\nPublished: 2025-11-22T06:43:41-05:00\n\nLeaders of Europe’s most powerful countries plan to meet Saturday on the sidelines of a global summit in Johannesburg to discuss a response to President Trump’s latest proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe proposal, a 28-point plan, calls for Ukrainian concessions already largely rejected by the country’s president and allies, including demands for land and limits on the size of Ukraine’s military. President Trump has given President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine until next week to agree to the plan, backing him into a seemingly lose-lose scenario as he faces the risk of losing crucial American support if he does not accept.\n\nEuropean leaders now face increased pressure to show they can get Ukraine the economic and military support it needs to continue battling Russia without U.S. support.\n\nUkraine’s European allies have already criticized the plan because it was negotiated between the United States and Russia, without Ukraine.\n\n“Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on Friday, adding that Europe would continue providing Ukraine with significant financial support and maintain sanctions against Russia.\n\nOn Saturday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain said in a statement that the leaders in Johannesburg would discuss how to secure a cease-fire and strengthen the Trump plan “for the next phase of negotiations.”\n\n“We cannot simply wait for peace,” he said. “We must strain every sinew to secure it.”\n\nThe proposal came just before the world’s largest economies gathered in South Africa for the annual Group of 20 heads of state summit. The gathering puts Mr. Starmer and the leaders of other Ukrainian allies such as France, Germany and the overall European Union in the same room with a Russian delegation led by a top deputy of President Vladimir V. Putin, who did not attend because he faced an international arrest warrant.\n\nThe United States did not send a delegation to the summit, with Mr. Trump saying he was boycotting it because of his belief that South Africa was persecuting its white minority.\n\nMr. Starmer, alluding to Russia in his statement, said, “There is only one country around the G20 table that is not calling for a cease-fire, and one country that is deploying a barrage of drones and missiles to destroy livelihoods and murder innocent civilians.”\n\nAntónio Costa, the president of the European Council, and Ms. von der Leyen, held a call with Mr. Zelensky on Friday night, and after that met with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. On Saturday morning, they met with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nMr. Costa has invited the leaders of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain to Saturday’s meeting on Ukraine, according to the E.U.\n\nThe current peace proposal was negotiated between Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s envoy for peace missions, and a Russian official, Kirill Dmitriev. It calls for Ukraine to surrender significant territory, including some that Russia does not already occupy. It also calls for a cap on the size of the Ukrainian military, and prohibits its membership in NATO and the presence of NATO troops in the country.\n\nIn her remarks on Friday, Ms. von der Leyen said, “Ukraine can count on us because this is not only an aggression against Ukraine, but it is an aggression against the principles of the U.N. charter,” referring to the United Nations. “It’s on European soil,” she said. “Therefore, we will support Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nG20 leaders had come to an agreement — by all the countries in attendance, including Russia — on a final summit declaration that called for the peaceful resolution of conflicts without force, said Vincent Magwenya, a spokesman for South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa. The declaration, which is not binding, specifically mentions the war in Ukraine.\n\nJeanna Smialek contributed reporting from Brussels.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/world/europe/russia-ukraine.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"06:13:58-05:00","title":"Ukrainians Wait in Pain as Hope to Find Strike Survivors Fades","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic attack on Ternopil, western Ukraine, Russian missile strikes killed 31 civilians and left 10 missing, including an 86-year-old woman, Valentyna Shablysta.

When Ihor Cherepanskyi was a child and needed a hug, or wanted dumplings with sour cream made in the kitchen of her sixth-floor apartment. When he was 25, and his mother died of cancer. Whenever.\n\nSo on Wednesday morning, when Russian missiles hit their city in western Ukraine, Mr. Cherepanskyi, 37, rushed to her building, his lifelong refuge. It was on fire, heavy black smoke billowing from the top, so much so that he could not see the extent of the damage. He ran up the stairs, but the stairs above the fifth floor were destroyed. So he called her. He heard a phone ringing somewhere above him.\n\nValentyna Shablysta — an 86-year-old woman who always had a red manicure and her makeup just so — did not answer.\n\n“I realized the chances were very small,” Mr. Cherepanskyi said just before 1 p.m. on Friday, standing in front of what remained of his great-grandmother’s building. “I understood the weight of the building, the power of the missile — all of it.”\n\nStill, he waited.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, the attack had killed 31 people in two nine-story apartment buildings in Ternopil, a city of about 225,000 far from the front lines that had been spared from major strikes like those on the capital, Kyiv, and on eastern Ukraine.\n\nSix of the dead in Ternopil were children. As of Friday afternoon, 10 people, including Ms. Shablysta, were still missing.\n\nRussia also hit a local factory in the attack, which came before 7 a.m., but no one was injured there. The strike was one of the worst on civilians in Ukraine — and the deadliest in the country’s west — since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nMoscow, saying it targets only military and energy facilities, said the attack was in retaliation for “terrorist attacks” carried out by Ukraine in Russia using U.S.-supplied long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nTo residents of Ternopil, the attack felt doubly painful, coming the same week that the United States presented a peace plan that would hand President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia some of his major goals — more territory, a weaker Ukrainian military and no chance for Ukraine to join NATO.\n\nThe Trump administration wants Ukraine’s answer to the proposal by next week. Ukraine has refused such offers before. Mr. Cherepanskyi called it “disgusting.”\n\nSince the missiles hit, Mr. Cherepanskyi has waited outside his great-grandmother’s building, arriving first thing each morning and going home just before curfew at midnight.\n\nHe has gone twice to the morgue to look at two bodies, but neither was Ms. Shablysta. One of the bodies had gray hair. Ms. Shablysta would never tolerate gray hair, he said. She always dyed hers a light blond.\n\nMr. Cherepanskyi has stood outside in temperatures that dipped five degrees below freezing. Wearing no gloves, a light jacket and a thin gray hat, he has watched rescue crews dig closer and closer to his great-grandmother’s apartment. He recognized her refrigerator, crumpled in the rubble on the fifth floor. He saw the crane pull out the section of stairs that were destroyed.\n\nAbout 180 emergency responders worked in shifts to try to dig out survivors. They rescued a young man who had been in his kitchen on the ninth floor and somehow survived. They found a parrot, still in its cage, along with two cats. Those animals were alive. But the young man was the only human survivor.\n\nA mother and daughter were found in an embrace, recognized only by the pendant on the woman’s neck, military officials said. Her daughter had just turned 8.\n\nTaras Hnatiuk, 18, initially survived, but he ran back inside several times to rescue people, according to friends of his at the scene. His body, found heavily burned, was recognized by a tattoo on his right forearm. “I love my mom,” it said.\n\nMr. Hnatiuk had moved with his mother to Poland after the Russian invasion. He was visiting his grandmother for 10 days in Ternopil.\n\n“We kept hoping until the end that he was somewhere on the lower floors, alive, or maybe he had gotten out somehow,” said Sofiia Larina, 16, a friend who came on Friday to leave flowers and cry. “But then we saw his apartment — it was right in the middle — and the apartment simply wasn’t there anymore.”\n\nOn Friday morning, three more bodies — two children and a woman — were pulled from the rubble.\n\nThe crowd of people waiting grew larger as the day grew longer. They created a makeshift memorial of candles, colorful lanterns, stuffed bunnies and bears, red carnations, purple chrysanthemums and two heart balloons in blue and yellow, the colors of Ukraine’s flag.\n\nOlha Hubitska, 66, came looking for her cousin, who she said was more like a sister. The family lived on the ninth floor; her cousin, her cousin’s daughter and her cousin’s granddaughter, Sofia, 4, were still missing. Ms. Hubitska pinballed between the apartment building and the hospital, where Sofia’s brother, Maksym, 10, was still recovering.\n\nShe said Maksym had told the family that he remembered a boom and that he had seen his grandmother — Ms. Hubitska’s cousin — on the floor with her eyes closed.\n\n“He told us, ‘I don’t know how I ended up on the seventh floor — maybe the wind, or a wave, I don’t know,’” Ms. Hubitska recalled.\n\nShe waited into the evening, when spotlights lit up the jagged ruins and the building’s blue, white and red tiles so the workers could keep going. Most of the 53 apartments in this building had been passed from generation to generation since being handed out under the Soviet Union.\n\nMr. Cherepanskyi’s great-grandmother, Ms. Shablysta, got her apartment in 1982 and decorated it with fancy green wallpaper with gold designs, he said.\n\nMs. Shablysta, a former teacher and former director at the nearby Children’s Creativity Center, liked to cook. She loved Murchyk (“the one who purrs”), her white cat speckled with gray that she walked on a leash in the playground, Mr. Cherepanskyi said. She lived in the apartment with her husband until he died in 2018.\n\nThe season’s first snow started to fall as Mr. Cherepanskyi waited on Friday. At 9:18 p.m., a crane pulled a red cart used to remove dead bodies up to the emergency workers who were digging near his great-grandmother’s refrigerator. He saw them move a dead cat to the side. A black body bag was eventually placed inside the cart.\n\nMr. Cherepanskyi waited on the ground, suspecting who was inside. His great-grandmother. She was number 32.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"17:29:46-05:00","title":"For Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Rough Education in MAGA Politics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a three-term Republican congresswoman from Georgia and a central figure in MAGA politics, has announced her departure from Congress effective January 5, 2025.

2021 as a lusty warrior for the recently defeated President Donald J. Trump. Less than five years later, she appears to have lost all appetite for fighting.\n\nOn Friday, even her close associates were stunned after the three-term Georgia congresswoman posted a 10-minute video on X announcing that she would be vacating her office on Jan. 5, one year before her term expires. One associate said that she did not inform her inner circle until about 20 minutes before her video went up.\n\nIn it, Ms. Greene insisted that her decision had everything to do with her disillusionment with the current sorry state of politics and was not a politically calculated “4-D chess game” on her part.\n\nFew believed her.\n\nThe question, “What is going on with MTG?” has consumed Washington in recent weeks.\n\nThe answer, according to interviews with friends and associates, is that she had become politically isolated, feeling betrayed by Mr. Trump, disgusted with her own party and friendless among the Democratic opposition. When Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social last week that he had had enough of Ms. Greene’s apostasies, labeling her “Marjorie Traitor Greene” and threatening to run a primary opponent in her district, Ms. Greene felt blindsided.\n\nTerrified by the ensuing wave of death threats aimed at her and her family from apparent supporters of Mr. Trump, she could no longer see any upside to duking it out in the political arena.\n\nIn Homeric fashion, the ultimate MAGA warrior laid down her sword and limped home to Rome, Ga.\n\nIn the months before the breakup with Mr. Trump, Ms. Greene appeared to be moving more swiftly away from her early far-right positions. She defied the administration by opposing military aid to Israel, demanded that the Epstein files be released and supported the extension of the health insurance subsidies passed during the Biden administration. She appeared on “The View,” the popular ABC morning talk show, and on CNN, where she told host Dana Bash, “I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics.”\n\nSpeculation that Ms. Greene is positioning herself for some higher electoral calling, perhaps even a presidential run, is not unwarranted. Since she first declared her candidacy for Congress in 2019, as a construction company businesswoman and social media activist who embraced far-right conspiracy theories, Ms. Greene has impressed Republican skeptics with her political acumen. She quickly became one of the most recognizable figures in American politics.\n\nA year into her first term, she festooned her House office walls with fan letters from well beyond the state of Georgia. Frequently in demand at MAGA-centric events, Ms. Greene is also a prolific fund-raiser, although one who relies almost entirely on small online donations. Once greeted with derision by Washingtonians as a shrill and zany show pony, she is now seen more as a savvy operator who understands the conservative base like few others.\n\nNotably, Ms. Greene in her exit video did not explicitly say goodbye to all that. Several people close to her suggest that she has at times contemplated running for higher office and may well revisit those ambitions. Still, the same people say her decision to abandon Congress was less a crass play for 2028 and more a reflection of how much she had come to dislike her job in the House. Ms. Greene declined to comment for this story.\n\nIt remains a source of frustration to Ms. Greene that mainstream media outlets continue to harp on conspiratorial views she held before she decided to seek office, such as her embrace of QAnon.\n\nTrue, in her prior life as a social media “citizen journalist” she once prowled the halls of the Capitol, hounding House Democrats like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Nancy Pelosi of California. But Ms. Greene often pointed out that she reserved near-equal contempt for the Republicans who had achieved so little when they held the majority during the first half of Mr. Trump’s first term. In Ms. Greene’s mind, her 2020 campaign slogan, “Save America Stop Socialism,” was as much about her party’s lethargy as it was about the threat posed by Democrats.\n\nEven Ms. Greene’s close associates acknowledge that her craving for attention thwarted her desire to be taken seriously. In 2022, she decided to replace her chief of staff, a Georgia political associate, with Ed Buckham, who once served as chief of staff to Tom DeLay, the former Republican House majority leader and one of the wiliest legislators the G.O.P. has ever known. But Ms. Greene never realized any significant legislative achievements, in part because she did not cultivate relationships with Democrats, who regarded her as a pox on Congress.\n\nThe same mutual abhorrence held true with establishment Republicans. Ms. Greene never could bring herself to play the game within her own party. Unknown in Georgia Republican circles when she decided to run, she became a statewide power only when her alliance with Mr. Trump made it so. Eyed with distaste by traditional GOP donors, Ms. Greene adopted an outsider’s I-don’t-care attitude just as Mr. Trump had done in 2016.\n\nLife in Washington improved for Ms. Greene in 2022, when the Republicans reclaimed the House. The new Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, took pains to court her support in return for plum committee assignments and a voice in the House majority’s agenda. But Ms. Greene’s alliance with Mr. McCarthy proved to be a mixed blessing at best. The far-right House Freedom Caucus rebelled against the speaker and, along the way, revoked Ms. Greene’s membership.\n\nThroughout her travails, she remained Mr. Trump’s earliest and loudest defender in the House. Ms. Greene continually claimed that her twice-impeached “favorite president” had been cheated out of victory in 2020, even as many in her party hoped to move on from him. During Mr. Trump’s two years of exile, she became a reliable warm-up act at his rallies. More than once, Ms. Greene told others, Mr. Trump seemed to float the idea of her being his running mate.\n\nWhen the party finally coalesced around the former president and he became the nominee in 2024, Mr. Trump directed Ms. Greene to sit beside him on the second day of the Republican National Convention, just three days after he had been shot by a would-be assassin.\n\nMs. Greene had reason to expect that her unceasing loyalty would be rewarded in the new administration. But Mr. Trump did not offer her a cabinet position. As the chairwoman of the newly established House Oversight subcommittee to root out government waste, Ms. Greene expected to be working in close partnership with the White House’s program-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk. Instead, her subcommittee was largely adrift, languishing from inattention after only a few hearings. She became aware that some senior West Wing officials regarded her with disfavor, according to a former White House official.\n\nOn the Hill, Ms. Greene was fast becoming homeless. She did not get along with the new Republican speaker, Mike Johnson. Her early antipathy toward progressive Democrats like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had been supplanted by ugly public spats with two Republican colleagues, Representatives Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.\n\nThe ongoing skirmishes between House leadership and the Freedom Caucus, combined with Mr. Trump’s seeming disinterest in the legislative body, wore on Ms. Greene’s patience. She contemplated running in Georgia for the Senate or perhaps governor. When Mr. Trump did nothing to encourage her aspirations, it began to dawn on Ms. Greene that her unflagging fidelity to the president was taken for granted, according to individuals familiar her thinking.\n\nPersonally injured though she was, Ms. Greene also told associates that she believed the Trump administration was straying from its “America First” principles. Both before and during the recent 43-day government shutdown, she spent time in her district interacting with voters. Constituents approached her to ask why the government was spending so much money in Ukraine and Israel. Some of them referred to the Israeli government’s occupation of Gaza as a “genocide.” Ms. Greene became the first House Republican to adopt the term.\n\nHer constituents in the 14th district also voiced dismay about the high cost of housing. She was outraged to learn that private equity firms were buying up whole neighborhoods in Georgia and elsewhere. When her two adult daughters informed her that her party’s spending bill would cause their health insurance rates to double, Ms. Greene joined a chorus of dissent that included few if any other prominent Republicans.\n\nBut Ms. Greene was particularly distressed by Mr. Trump’s refusal to release the Epstein files. She had met with several of Mr. Epstein’s accusers in her Washington office. Though she did not claim to have suffered abuse as they had, Ms. Greene later told others that she could understand what it was like as a woman to be standing up to powerful men.\n\nOn Nov. 4, the five women who co-host “The View” were prepared for Ms. Greene to be in the mood to brawl, according to a person who was on the set. Instead, the hosts were surprised by her agreeable demeanor. At the end of the segment, Ms. Greene pointedly said to them, “Women to women, we need to pave a new path.”\n\nMs. Greene remains highly popular back home. Still, in Mr. Trump’s race against Vice President Kamala Harris last November, he carried the counties in Ms. Greene’s deep-red district by greater margins than she did against her Democratic opponent, Shawn Harris. The prospect of running in 2026 against a well-funded challenger handpicked by the president would have forced what she referred to her in her video as “my sweet district” to pick sides.\n\nMs. Greene has expressed confidence that she would have prevailed in a 2026 primary. Even in victory, however, she would have likely remained reviled by her party’s leader. Ms. Greene is also convinced, as she said in her video announcement, that the Republicans will lose the midterms next year and that the House Democratic majority will likely pursue more investigations against Mr. Trump. In such a scenario, Republicans would rally around the president. But could she, after Mr. Trump’s efforts to destroy her career?\n\nThere is little chance that Ms. Greene’s saga will end with her changing parties, despite the supportive calls and emails she has received from some Democrats. For that matter, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other Democratic members have openly expressed skepticism that Ms. Greene, who promoted Mr. Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud that led to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, is sincerely contrite and intent on pursuing a kinder, gentler mode of politics.\n\nAll of which leaves Ms. Greene in limbo. According to a close associate, her only immediate aim is to try and enjoy life for the first time in a long while.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/trump-federalist-society.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:06-05:00","title":"The Federalist Society Is Torn Between Its Legal Philosophy and Trump’s Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federalist Society, a 43-year-old conservative legal network founded in 1982, played a pivotal role in shaping judicial appointments during Donald Trump’s first term, particularly through the influence of Leonard Leo.

In a lengthy social media post in May, he called Mr. Leo a “sleazebag” who “openly brags how he controls Judges.” The Federalist Society, he said, had given him “bad advice.”\n\nConsidering the crowd that assembled earlier this month in Washington for the Federalist Society’s annual lawyers’ convention — including many close allies of Mr. Trump — it was clear that the organization still commands influence.\n\nDozens of federal judges from across the country attended the event at the Washington Hilton. Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett of the Supreme Court spoke at the gala dinner and a third justice, Samuel A. Alito Jr., sat among the crowd of 2,300.\n\nWhat was less clear was if the organization was ready to fully embrace the hyperaggressive legal views of the president who had empowered it like never before.\n\nFrom the stage, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, and Chad Mizelle, who recently stepped down from another top Justice Department position, delivered stem-winding remarks slamming judges who had stood in Mr. Trump’s way.\n\nBut the convention’s panels also offered a platform to speakers who questioned key administration policies, including attempts to curtail diversity, equity and inclusion programs and deploy the National Guard in U.S. cities.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Leo said the Federalist Society was “not monolithic” but rather a “crucible and a proving ground” where conservatives could “work out their differences, or they make their points and try to persuade other people of what their positions are.”\n\nEven after his complaint about Mr. Leo’s influence over first-term picks, Mr. Trump has continued to use the Federalist Society’s pipeline of judicial talent. The size of the group’s network means that most qualified, Republican-friendly judicial nominees will have some ties to it. Indeed, out of six nominees to the appellate courts that Mr. Trump has chosen in his second term, five have spoken at a society event, according to its website.\n\nBut for a society that claims the Constitution as the uniting force for its varied membership, some longtime allies have warned Mr. Trump’s second term poses an unusual challenge. Actions like killing people suspected of trafficking drugs at sea, ordering up investigations of his political opponents and excoriating judges who rule against him, they say, violate both the letter and spirit of America’s founding document.\n\n“There’s a real tension, from a rule-of-law perspective, between some members of the Federalist Society and the Trump administration,” said Edward Whelan, an attorney who has spoken at dozens of the society’s events, and clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n“Good judges will make the hard calls they’re obligated to make without worrying what people will say about them. MAGA-oriented voices say that they want fearless judges — but many of them seem really to want judges who will do Trump’s bidding,” he said.\n\nThe Federalist Society was founded in 1982 by law students from Yale, Harvard and the University of Chicago. Back then, right-leaning students attending elite law schools saw themselves as an embattled minority whose ideas could not get a fair hearing on campuses entranced by the progressive jurisprudence popular in the decades after World War II.\n\nThe group was quickly championed by leading conservative thinkers, including Mr. Scalia, the future Supreme Court justice. By the mid-1980s, it had grown to dozens of campus chapters.\n\nAs it gained influence, some liberal critics began painting the Federalist Society as a right-wing effort to remake the judiciary. But the group was careful to set limits on its tactics, if not on its ambitions. It did not take positions on issues or make arguments in court. Its power was instead informal, a function of its far-reaching network.\n\nThe alliance between the Federalist Society and Mr. Trump started during his first White House run. Over the next few years, Mr. Leo, then the group’s executive vice president, would begin carving out an influential role in Republican politics outside the society, one that would eventually encompass raising millions of dollars for other conservative groups and helping lead a for-profit media relations firm.\n\nMr. Trump, who needed to reassure traditional conservatives who were still getting to know him, welcomed the organization’s network into his campaign. In 2016, he met with Mr. Leo and Donald F. McGahn II, a longtime society member and a campaign lawyer who would become his White House counsel, to discuss a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. In a statement, a spokesman for the society said that any influence that the group might have exercised over Mr. Trump’s judicial picks came from individual members, not from the society as a whole. But Mr. Trump sometimes ignored that distinction. “We’re going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by Federalist Society,” Mr. Trump said in a June 2016 interview with Breitbart.\n\nIn February 2017, when Mr. Trump held a press event to tout Neil M. Gorsuch as his first Supreme Court pick, Mr. Leo was there.\n\nLater that year, Mr. McGahn, who was responsible for managing Mr. Trump’s judicial nominees, poked fun at the claim that Mr. Trump had outsourced the process. “I’ve been a member of the Federalist Society since law school — still am,” he said in a lecture at the society’s annual convention. “So, frankly, it seems like it’s been insourced.”\n\nBut as Mr. Trump’s first term drew to a close, his relationship with Mr. Leo soured. In 2020, Mr. Trump publicly berated him at Mar-a-Lago over the Justice Department’s investigation into ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, claiming Mr. Leo had recommended the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who had appointed a special counsel. And Mr. Leo did little to marshal conservative support for Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat at the polls by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nMike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project, a legal nonprofit that also espouses originalism but is more closely aligned with the MAGA movement, said too many of the Federalist Society’s leaders were “missing in action” during the Biden years, when Mr. Trump faced criminal investigations and a lengthy trial. “Some of those Fed Soc leaders even cheered on the lawfare,” he said. Mr. Trump’s falling out with Mr. Leo cast some doubt on whether Mr. Leo’s network would continue to wield as much influence in the second term.\n\nAsked if the group had any current role in selecting judges, a White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said Mr. Trump relied on his advisers and the Justice Department to identify and vet candidates.\n\n“Other individuals and groups are always free to share their views, but the president is the ultimate decision maker,” she said.\n\nThe crowd at an Article III Project reception last month, blocks from the White House, was one indication that the Federalist Society now has some competition. Inside the private party at Café Fiorello were Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director; Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for Washington; Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a former Trump national security adviser and later, pardon recipient; as well as Mr. Blanche and Mr. Mizelle.\n\nAlso present was the White House counsel, David Warrington, whose office manages the judicial selection process.\n\nToday, the Federalist Society still considers itself to be a “big tent” debating society, one that welcomes a range of conservative views — including those who have adopted Mr. Trump’s criticism of a judiciary filled with society members.\n\n“It’s a war, man,” Mr. Blanche told the crowd, speaking of Justice Department efforts to appeal unfavorable rulings. He criticized “activist judges\" who he said were “more political or as political as the most liberal governor or D.A.”\n\nMr. Mizelle, speaking on a panel, told a story about a call his father had made to the local Humane Society about a stray cat that was wandering through his yard. Mr. Mizelle compared judges to the felines. “I’m from Mississippi,” he recalled his father saying. “We know how to deal with stray cats.”\n\nThis was met with a mix of mild chuckles and stunned silence from the audience.\n\nMr. Mizelle, who is married to a Trump-appointed federal judge, explained minutes later that his proposed solution was to impeach judges who blocked administration policies, something that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has said would be improper.\n\nMr. Mizelle did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Justice Department said that the department would “continue to follow the Constitution” and “defend its lawful authorities.”\n\nWhile administration officials were comfortable delivering broad-bore criticisms of the judiciary, the judges at the convention skirted the president whose agenda had provoked lawsuits that were occupying so much bandwidth at their courthouses. In an evening lecture, Judge Andrew Oldham, a Trump nominee from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, pondered whether there should be some limit to the Federalist Society’s “big tent” approach, even as he gave what sounded like a chest-thumping affirmation of Trump-era conservatism.\n\nHe praised the murdered conservative activist Charlie Kirk and threw shade at the Biden-era pandemic czar Dr. Anthony Fauci. And he tallied conservative Supreme Court wins on issues like abortion and gun control.\n\n“Textualism won. Originalism won,” he said, declaring victory for the Federalist Society’s two guiding legal philosophies, which ask that judges focus on the exact wording of laws and the meaning of the Constitution at the time of the nation’s founding.\n\nBut at least one judge in the audience felt it was too soon for Judge Oldham to proclaim that the conservative legal movement had won.\n\nBefore the speech was done, Judge William H. Pryor Jr., the 63-year-old chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, texted Judge Oldham and other members of the conservative appellate bench a bespoke meme. It was the famous photo of President George W. Bush in 2003, standing on an aircraft carrier in front of a “Mission Accomplished” banner, announcing victory in a war that would drag on for years. In place of Mr. Bush’s head was Judge Oldham’s — a barbed inside joke suggesting that the fight for originalism and textualism was far from over.\n\nIn an interview a few days after the convention, Judge Pryor said he did not intend for the meme, which was described to the The Times by a recipient who asked not to be identified, to become public.\n\n“That was really meant to be a private joke between me and Judge Oldham, as friends,” he said. He declined to comment further.\n\nEven as originalists gained power due in large part to Mr. Trump’s nominations, some at the convention felt that fidelity to constitutional principles now required a break with the president’s agenda.\n\nIn attendance was Ilya Somin, one of the lawyers for the private businesses in the Supreme Court case challenging Mr. Trump’s tariffs, who praised judges who have ruled against Mr. Trump. Referencing Mr. Mizelle’s judges-as-cats analogy, Mr. Somin said cats “can be very useful in catching rats,” which he characterized as the administration’s “massive abuses of power in many areas.”\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Leo took a more conciliatory tone toward Mr. Trump, saying his judicial picks have “ushered in a series of generational wins” that “conservatives never would have imagined.” But he suggested the president should take at least some of his courtroom losses in stride.\n\n“The conservative movement owes the president a debt of gratitude for what he did,” Mr. Leo said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that he is going to win on every issue the way he wants to win.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/house-censures.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"15:00:13-05:00","title":"In the House, Censures Proliferate, Reflecting a Poisonous Climate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House of Representatives has seen a dramatic and alarming increase in censure motions in recent years, transforming from rare, serious disciplinary actions into a common, partisan political tool.

One Democrat plotted to handpick his successor, while another texted with the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. A Republican was accused by his colleagues of contracting abuses, faking his military honors and assaulting a woman at his apartment. A third Democrat was indicted on charges that she stole Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.\n\nIt was a vivid illustration of how official House rebukes, once exceedingly rare and mostly a matter of consensus for the most egregious conduct or illegal acts by a sitting member of Congress, have become commonplace in recent years.\n\nMembers of both parties have stepped up the use of censure resolutions as a partisan political weapon. Many of them include accusations by lawmakers that in the past would first have been investigated by the House Ethics Committee — and often weighed in court — before reaching the floor if found to be valid.\n\nInstead, these days, lawmakers are running to the House floor right away with accusations and innuendos, leading to a proliferation of calls for official scoldings, which is a bit like a gossipy group chat spilling into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe censure arms race has generated so much bad blood among members — and consumed so much time — that some in both parties are calling for bipartisan steps to de-escalate. Others are crying foul at what they claim are backroom deals being made between the top leaders of both parties to quietly kill the measures, though leaders on both sides deny that is happening.\n\n“We’re wasting each other’s time here,” said Representative David Joyce of Ohio, one of a few Republicans who voted against censuring a Democratic lawmaker on Tuesday. “We’ve got important business to do on behalf of our country, and to waste it on these high school fights is just ridiculous.”\n\nHere’s a look at what’s going on.\n\nA censure resolution is a disciplinary measure brought to the House floor to condemn a lawmaker for unlawful or unethical acts. It signals disapproval by a majority of the body of a lawmaker’s actions, but stops short of expelling them from the House.\n\nOnce censured, a member must stand in the well of the House as the resolution, which includes a recitation of their misdeeds, is read aloud as a public rebuke. Members can also be removed from their committee assignments as part of a censure, as in the case of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, in 2021, and Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, in 2023.\n\nA lesser form of reprimand is a resolution of disapproval. The House passed one on Tuesday, rebuking Representative Jesús García, Democrat of Illinois, for hand-selecting his successor.\n\nThat scolding was a rare instance in which a lawmaker — in that case Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington — initiated the rebuke of a member of her own party. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus were so livid that they weighed censuring her in retaliation, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions, though no such measure has been introduced.\n\nFive members of the House have been censured since 2021, and several more have faced censure attempts that failed. Before that, the last censure was back in 2010, against Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, a Democrat who had been found guilty of several ethics violations and the first member of either party in nearly three decades to face a censure.\n\nCensures are unique in that they are privileged, meaning they have a special status that requires them to be brought to the House floor quickly, without being blessed by leadership or going through a committee.\n\nThat means there is little barrier for introducing and demanding a vote on one. It has become common practice for Democrats to retaliate against Republicans for trying to censure their members, and vice versa.\n\nRepublicans on Tuesday moved to censure Delegate Stacey Plaskett, Democrat of the Virgin Islands, and remove her from the Intelligence Committee for exchanging text messages with Mr. Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing.\n\nRepresentative Yvette Clarke, Democrat of New York, then introduced a censure resolution against Representative Cory Mills, Republican of Florida, for having “on several occasions conducted himself in a manner that reflects discredit upon the House of Representatives.” Among other things, it cited news reports about the police being called to Mr. Mills’s apartment this year to investigate what was later classified as a domestic violence incident involving a woman who was not his wife, campaign finance misdeeds and accusations that he had falsified the events that led to his being awarded the Bronze Star.\n\nThe Plaskett censure effort failed on Wednesday, when a half-dozen Republicans crossed party lines and helped Democrats defeat it. Ms. Clarke never did insist on a vote on her censure proposal against Mr. Mills.\n\nSome Republicans, including Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, cried foul, asserting that the two congressional leaders had cut a secret deal to sink both measures.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson’s office denied that there had been any such agreement. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, sidestepped questions about whether there had been a deal, saying only that Democrats would not “unilaterally disarm.”\n\nEnraged, Ms. Mace filed her own censure resolution against Mr. Mills, accusing him of stolen valor, financial misconduct and dating violence.\n\nThat attempt failed on Wednesday, when lawmakers voted instead to refer the allegations to the Ethics Committee, which hours before announced it had opened an investigation into his conduct.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have argued in recent days that the censure was being abused.\n\n“It has become a political tactic, rather than an action to protect the reputation of the House,” said Representative Steny Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, who in past years served as the majority and minority leader. “If it becomes common, it will lose its prophylactic effect.”\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan pair in the House introduced a bill to raise the vote threshold to censure a member, disapprove of their conduct or remove them from committees from a simple majority to 60 percent of members present and voting.\n\n“We believe this is a sensible reform that would fix a broken process and raise the level of sanity in the House,” Representatives Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska, and Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, wrote in a letter to their colleagues on Thursday.\n\nThe need to make changes to the censure process drew some backing from Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina and the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, who stopped short of endorsing the proposal to raise the vote threshold but said there were “a lot of concerns on both sides of the aisle” about the recent surge in censures. A top Democrat on the panel, Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, said there was “broad support” to overhaul the process.\n\nCongressional ethics experts caution that one byproduct of the censure fever is likely to be a further lowering of the public opinion of Congress.\n\n“When you have these attempts to censure someone based on anything less than solid facts and legal analysis of what is the violation, you do have damage done to public trust and public understanding of what’s really going on,” said Kedric Payne, who was previously deputy chief counsel at the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nRepresentative Andrew Garbarino, Republican of New York and a member of the Ethics Committee, said it would be far better if that panel could investigate allegations before they were sped to the House floor for a vote.\n\n“Right now, it seems it’s a race to get them done so somebody can get on the news,” he said.\n\nFor now, the appetite among members of Congress to punish one another appears insatiable. On Wednesday, within hours after federal prosecutors charged Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, Democrat of Florida, with stealing federal disaster funds and funneling them into her congressional campaign, a Republican said he would introduce a censure.\n\nBut that did not last long. Representative Greg Steube, also of Florida, soon announced that he would seek a graver penalty, even before Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick has faced trial.\n\n“On second thought,” Mr. Steube wrote in a post on social media. “I have decided to skip censure and move straight to expulsion.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/tatiana-schlossberg-kennedy-cancer.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"18:19:27-05:00","title":"A Cancer Diagnosis Brings a New Season of Grief to the Kennedy Family","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tatiana Schlossberg, a 35-year-old environmental journalist and granddaughter of John F.

Kennedy, revealed in an essay published in The New Yorker on Saturday that she is fighting a rare and aggressive blood cancer, acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nMs. Schlossberg, an environmental journalist, said in the essay that her cancer was discovered in May 2024, while she was in the hospital for the birth of her second child.\n\n“I did not — could not — believe that they were talking about me,” she wrote of her diagnosis. “I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn’t sick. I didn’t feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I know.”\n\n“I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I needed to take care of,” she continued. “This could not possibly be my life.”\n\nThe essay was published on the magazine’s website on the 62nd anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination. In it, Ms. Schlossberg described her harrowing medical journey of the past 18 months, the enveloping support of her parents and siblings, who, she wrote, “have been raising my children and sitting in my various hospital rooms almost every day,” and her oncologist’s quest to find a treatment that would save her life.\n\n“He has scoured every inch of the earth for more treatments for me,” she wrote. “He knows I don’t want to die and he is trying to stop it.”\n\nMs. Schlossberg, a former science writer for The New York Times, lashes out at her first cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for policy decisions and budget cuts that put the nation’s well being, and her own fragile health, at risk. And she acknowledges, with raw honesty, the long history of tragedy in her family, and the pain of knowing that her illness has delivered her mother into another season of grief.\n\nMs. Kennedy, 67, a former ambassador to Australia and Japan, was five years old when her father was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963. Her uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated five years later. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., was killed in 1999, at 38 years old, when the small plane he was piloting crashed into the ocean en route to Martha’s Vineyard, off the Massachusetts coast.\n\n“For my whole life, I have tried to be good,” to spare her mother further suffering, Ms. Schlossberg wrote. “Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family’s life, and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.”\n\nShe details a series of intense and rapidly escalating treatments for her cancer, beginning with chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant. Her sister, Rose Schlossberg, donated stem cells to the transplant effort. Her brother, Jack Schlossberg, who is running for Congress, was a half-match but “still asked every doctor if maybe a half-match was better, just in case.”\n\nHer husband, George Moran, a doctor, slept on the hospital floor, she wrote, and dealt with the demands of “doctors and insurance people that I didn’t want to talk to.”\n\n“He is perfect,” Ms. Schlossberg wrote of her husband, “and I feel so cheated and so sad that I don’t get to keep living the wonderful life I had with this kind, funny, handsome genius I managed to find.”\n\nIn remission from the cancer after 50 days of treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Ms. Schlossberg went home, began a new round of chemotherapy, and relapsed, she wrote. She joined a clinical trial in January, trying an immunotherapy in which doctors tried to program her transplanted T-cells to attack the cancer. A second transplant followed.\n\nMs. Schlossberg said she tried to be “the perfect patient.”\n\n“If I did everything right, if I was nice to everyone all the time, if I didn’t need any help or have any problems,” she wrote, “then it would work.”\n\nAdding to her fears were the actions of her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, who she calls “an embarrassment” to her family. She describes her alarm that his attacks on vaccines could leave her “to spend the rest of my life immunocompromised,” and her horror as she watched the government eliminate millions in funding for mRNA vaccines used to fight some cancers, and from the budget of the National Institutes of Health, cuts that disrupted treatments and clinical trials for thousands of patients.\n\n“Suddenly,” she wrote, “the health care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky.”\n\nWhile striking notes of anger and frustration, Ms. Schlossberg centers much of the essay on her love for her two young children, and her grief and disbelief that she will not be there to see them grow up. She reminds her son often “that I am a writer,” she notes, “so that he will know that I was not just a sick person.”\n\nShe also poignantly describes the dissonance of striving to live in the moment with her children, and imprinting vivid memories of their time together, while knowing that the memories she is making will die with her.\n\nShe recalls one memory she treasures, of her son and an ice cream truck, when she told him that she didn’t want ice cream herself. “He hugged me, patted me on the back, and said, ‘I hear you buddy, I hear you,’” she wrote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/rose-bowl-pasadena-ucla.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"05:01:11-05:00","title":"The War of the Rose Bowl","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For 43 years, the University of California, Los Angeles (U.C.L.A.) has played its football games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, a partnership forged in 1980 and binding through a contract that runs until 2044.

Never mind that the stadium and the school are 26 miles apart. Marriage is cumulative, and U.C.L.A. and the Rose Bowl have had much to bind them: Four decades. Millions of dollars. An ironclad deal.\n\nOr so it seemed until last month, when Pasadena officials went to court, claiming that U.C.L.A. had been plotting for months in secret to relocate to SoFi Stadium, a newer, closer and glitzier venue. Such a move, Pasadena said, would irreparably harm the Rose Bowl and the city, which owns the stadium and borrowed heavily to refurbish it on condition that the team would remain through June 2044.\n\nThe university, in a terse statement, said that “no decision has been made.” But behind the scenes, Pasadena said, the university’s lawyers had informed the city’s lawyers that the school would be “moving on” after this season.\n\nSince then, Southern Californians have watched awkwardly and painfully, like children caught up in a drawn-out divorce. Major law firms have been deployed. Professional experts have been consulted. Alumni have taken sides along generational and geographic lines.\n\n“It’s an unholy mess,” said John Sandbrook, 76, a former U.C.L.A. assistant chancellor who in 1982 helped negotiate the Rose Bowl contract between the university and Pasadena.\n\nChris Rising, 56, a real estate developer who lives near the Bowl and whose father, Nelson Rising, was a major U.C.L.A. donor, said his family was so angry and hurt that he decided not to help endow a new masters of real estate development program.\n\nKai Dizon, 20, a sportswriter for The Daily Bruin, the U.C.L.A. student newspaper, was excited. If the team, which has lost seven out of 10 games this year, would only stop playing an hour away in “a dump gilded in someone else’s nostalgia,” he wrote, maybe the stands wouldn’t be more than half empty at every game.\n\nAs the Bruins prepared to meet the University of Washington on Saturday for their final home game of the season, speculation has focused on the possibility that this also might be their last home game at the Rose Bowl.\n\n“If the Rose Bowl and U.C.L.A. were to go separate ways, it would be a seismic shock in Los Angeles, and I do not think that’s an overstatement,” said Evan Lovett, 47, a U.C.L.A. alumnus and the creator of “L.A. in a Minute,” a popular online show about Los Angeles history and culture.\n\nBut, he added, “there is also a certain perspective of: ‘This could be great for recruiting. Who doesn’t want to play at SoFi?’”\n\nIn Southern California, the venues in question need no introduction.\n\nOn one side of the metropolis, Pasadena’s 103-year-old Rose Bowl, internationally known for its uncomfortable seats and breathtaking sunsets. On the other, five-year-old SoFi, a palatial $5.5 billion complex in Inglewood with two N.F.L. teams and many luxury suites, but debatable tailgating amenities.\n\nCaught in the middle are two pillars of the West Coast establishment: The city of Pasadena, known worldwide as the home of the Tournament of Roses, the nationally televised parade and football game that snowed-in Americans watch each New Year’s Day with intense weather envy. And U.C.L.A., a top-ranked university with an enrollment of more than 48,000 students and increasing financial challenges.\n\nUnlike many schools, U.C.L.A.’s football team does not host games on campus. Its neighbors in dense, affluent West Los Angeles have steadfastly opposed stadium proposals. Instead, the football program, like that of its rival, the University of Southern California, plays in public venues.\n\nFrom the late 1920s until the early 1980s, another historic stadium, the Los Angeles Coliseum, hosted both teams, an arrangement that had continued even after 1946, when the Coliseum added two professional football tenants, the Los Angeles Rams and the short-lived Los Angeles Dons.\n\nIn 1980, the Rams relocated. Two litigation-filled years later, the Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles. Even before they arrived, recalled Mr. Sandbrook, the former U.C.L.A. assistant chancellor, U.C.L.A. realized that the Raiders and U.S.C., which is next to the Coliseum, would dominate the venue. When the Coliseum’s governing board approved a lease without letting his boss at the time, Chancellor Charles E. Young, even speak in opposition, Mr. Sandbrook said, the chancellor told him to set Rose Bowl negotiations in motion. Two intensive weeks later, they had a deal.\n\nThe Los Angeles mayor at the time, Tom Bradley, opposed the move. Homeowners in the stately neighborhoods around the Rose Bowl balked at the traffic. Some still wonder whether it made sense for a school on Los Angeles’s showbiz-heavy Westside to send its team to a far-off field in genteel Pasadena.\n\n“They always seemed a little out of place here,” said Jim Robertson, 78, a local retiree taking a walk on a recent weekday outside the bucolic stadium.\n\nBut the university got a world-renowned venue and more of the revenues than at the Coliseum, and did not have to share space and branding with two high-profile programs. And Pasadena got an anchor tenant to help cover maintenance and upgrades. Attendance surged as U.C.L.A. rose to the top of its athletic conference at the time, winning the New Year’s Day Rose Bowl in three of the next four years.\n\nAs decades passed, teams began abandoning iconic stadiums like Florida’s Orange Bowl for new sports complexes. Pasadena officials worried that Los Angeles might get a new N.F.L. stadium someday and the Rose Bowl could lose U.C.L.A. In 2010, the agreement was renewed.\n\nSince then, the Rose Bowl has issued city-backed bonds to invest more than $150 million in stadium improvements. The pavilion housing a new press box and premium seating has been named for the longtime U.C.L.A. football coach Terry Donahue. The home locker room is named for former Chancellor Young. In January, work is set to begin on a renovation and an exclusive field club in the south end zone.\n\nU.C.L.A. pays no rent. Instead, the Rose Bowl takes a substantial percentage of ticket sales, concessions and other ancillary revenue such as box seats. Under the contract, U.C.L.A. cannot play home football games anywhere else in Los Angeles or Orange Counties, cannot terminate the contract and must remain at the stadium until the bond debt’s scheduled repayment 19 years from now.\n\nBut the world in which U.C.L.A. signed the deal is not the world it finds itself in now. New rules have pushed collegiate athletics more toward a professional business model, and new leaders oversee the university and its finances. U.C.L.A.’s new chancellor, Julio Frenk, arrived this year. Its new chief financial officer, Stephen J. Agostini, arrived last year. Its athletic director, Martin Jarmond, was hired in 2020. Rose Bowl defenders note pointedly that all came from outside California.\n\nIn May, members of the University of California Board of Regents grilled the three U.C.L.A. officials about the athletic department’s financial situation, including structural deficits that have left the department with annual shortfalls of tens of millions of dollars. A new regent, Bob Myers, the former general manager of the Golden State Warriors, rubbed his brow as the group explained that the lack of an on-campus stadium deprived U.C.L.A. of revenue streams common to other schools.\n\nMr. Jarmond, the athletic director, told him that other Big Ten programs earned $15 million to $25 million a year from premium and club seats, but U.C.L.A. captured none of that under its deal with the Rose Bowl. The end zone renovation would bring U.C.L.A. some premium seat income, he said, but not until after next year.\n\nThat exchange occurred about three months after Rose Bowl officials said they had begun to hear rumors that U.C.L.A. was moving to SoFi.\n\nCity officials said U.C.L.A. at first denied the rumors. In October, though, city officials said, a lawyer for the university told one of Pasadena’s lawyers that U.C.L.A. no longer wanted to play at the Rose Bowl and planned to relocate “sooner rather than later.”\n\nThe university’s lawyer, identified in court documents as Jeffrey S. Moorad, the head of the global sports industry team at the law firm Morgan Lewis, did not respond to requests for comment. At a recent court appearance, a team of U.C.L.A. lawyers from another high-profile law firm, Gibson Dunn, said the city was jumping to conclusions. But they added only that U.C.L.A. intended to finish this season at the Rose Bowl. A spokesperson for SoFi Stadium said its owners “do not have a comment at this time.”\n\nIn Pasadena, the dispute has cut to the civic core, raising questions that go to the very identity of the city of more than 138,000 people.\n\n“The Rose Bowl is the heart and soul of Pasadena, and the heart and soul of the Rose Bowl is college football,” said Mayor Victor Gordo, a Mexican immigrant who, as a child, worked outside the stadium selling little stuffed footballs. “This isn’t like a lease agreement for a condo.”\n\nThe Bowl is a stalwart venue for concerts, soccer, flea markets and other uses, the mayor said, and will host events in the 2028 Olympics. But without U.C.L.A., its football schedule could shrink to the New Year’s Day game and the Turkey Tussle, an annual showdown between two rival high school teams.\n\nDon Smith, the manager of The 35er Bar in the Old Town Pasadena business district, attributed about 20 percent of the bar’s monthly revenue during football season to home games. “U.C.L.A. made a commitment and in return, the city invested,” Mr. Smith said. “Now U.C.L.A. wants to run out the door with our tax dollars? Just, ‘See ya later, Pasadena, have a good day?’”\n\nMr. Smith said he hoped that the university would reconsider. “If U.C.L.A. is in contention, the U.C.L.A. fans show up,” he said.\n\nHis advice? Win more games. Maybe, as in all marriages, this was just a rough patch.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/john-larson-connecticut-congress-election.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"15:36:22-05:00","title":"As Democrats Look to a New Generation, John Larson Hangs On","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Representative John Larson, a 77-year-old Democrat from Connecticut, is running for a 15th term in Congress amid a growing debate within the Democratic Party about generational change.

Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, sidled up to the silver counter at Augie & Rays in East Hartford on a recent Monday morning, ordering a coffee at this drive-in diner that he has frequented for so long that it serves an egg sandwich named for him.\n\nIt was far from the first time that Mr. Larson, 77, had chosen this working-class gathering spot as a backdrop for an interview. After more than 25 years in Congress, Mr. Larson has his way of doing things that has worked for him.\n\nBut this year is different. For the first time since 1999, Mr. Larson has serious challengers in his own party arguing that he has stayed on in Congress for too long. One of them is already out-raising him.\n\nAnd by choosing to run again anyway at a time when many of his contemporaries are retiring, Mr. Larson, who suffered a complex partial seizure on the House floor last year, has thrust his primary smack into the middle of the Democratic Party’s raging debate about the need for generational change in its ranks at a crossroads moment for the country.\n\nMr. Larson’s race will offer a test case for whether Democrats prefer a new generation to help them start fresh, or if they still see value in veteran lawmakers who can offer their constituents institutional experience and seniority.\n\nHis primary opponents in this heavily blue district, which is all but certain to remain Democratic no matter the outcome, are betting on a desire to turn the page.\n\n“I’m angry about the fact that we are where we are in part because President Biden didn’t pass the torch,” said Luke Bronin, 46, the former mayor of Hartford and a former Rhodes Scholar and veteran running for the seat, who had raised $143,660 more than Mr. Larson as of October 1. “As a party, we would be stronger if we were better at lifting up the next generation and recognizing that a fundamental part of leadership is doing your service and knowing when it’s time.”\n\nHe added: “I feel very strongly that after 27 years of being in Congress, John Larson has begun to do the same thing the same way. This is not a moment when that’s what we need as a party or as a country.”\n\nJillian Gilchrest, 43, who served four terms in the state legislature, is the other serious contender in the race. She has criticized Mr. Larson for relying on the same playbook for too long and for focusing only on the issue of Social Security.\n\nThe age issue in this race, however, lands in a gray area. Despite his very visible incident on the House floor — Mr. Larson said that the seizure he suffered had no lasting effect and that it was easily treated with medication he was taking — the veteran congressman is still energetic, even if he shows signs of being culturally out of touch.\n\nAs he toured an indoor food market in East Hartford recently with a reporter in tow, Mr. Larson asked a woman working in one stand, “What are bubble teas?” And as he spoke with the manager of a recording studio that was seeking a federal earmark, Mr. Larson asked him, earnestly, “What’s content creation?” (He was told, politely, that it was “what you see on social media.”)\n\nBut as he sat in the window at Augie & Rays, as he had so many times before, Mr. Larson made the case for why his age and experience were actually major assets as he sought a 15th term in office. His reason for hanging on when many of his peers in the House have announced their retirements, he said, is that he wants to see a Social Security bill he has long championed, which would expand benefits to all seniors, come to the floor for a vote.\n\n“When you’re the leader of the band, how does it make sense to say: ‘Hey, you know what? I know we’ve worked hard for this, but I’m thinking maybe I shouldn’t see this through,’” he said. “I’m not going to back away from the thing I worked on for a decade when we’re four seats away from taking back the House.”\n\nMr. Larson, who grew up in public housing and taught history before becoming a politician, had hinted to people that his seat could be opening at some point and encouraged people to run.\n\nAfter a long period of stagnation within the Democratic ranks of Congress, many colleagues of his generation have chosen to head for the exits. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, 80, and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, 81, recently said they would not seek re-election. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 85, said the same. All eyes in the House are on Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, 86, whom some expect to follow suit.\n\nBut by last summer, Mr. Larson had become convinced that it made sense to run again, telling himself and others that he wanted another term in order to see his life’s work to completion and have his Social Security legislation signed into law by President Trump.\n\nThat may be very wishful thinking. Even when Democrats controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress, his legislation did not get out of committee. And he has spent the year warning that what the Trump administration really wants to do is gut and privatize Social Security.\n\nStill, this is the tape that Mr. Larson says he wants to run through.\n\nWould he commit, then, to this being his final term in office?\n\n“No one ever says that this is your last term, or you’re not going to run again,” he said. “You become a lame duck.”\n\n(Counterpoint: Janet Mills, the former governor who is running for Senate in Maine at the age of 77, said on the day she announced her campaign that she would serve for only one term if elected. Mr. Larson called that decision “strange.”)\n\nMr. Larson conceded that there had been problematic instances of elected Democrats who had stayed in office past the point where they were no longer serving their party or their voters, Mr. Biden being one of them. But he said he did not think he was among them.\n\n“The concept of winds of change, that’s always out there, yeah, I’m clearly aware of it,” he said. “I think it’s district by district. But it’s not as though I have people coming up to me and saying, ‘I think now is the time for you to step aside.’”\n\nThey may not be saying it to his face, but some Democrats are indeed saying it.\n\n“What I hear a lot from constituents is, ‘We don’t want another Feinstein moment,’” said Tejal Vallam, the chair of the Democratic committee in the Connecticut suburb of Rocky Hill, referring to former Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who clung to her seat even after her memory and cognitive issues made it difficult to perform the job. Ms. Feinstein died in office.\n\nMs. Vallam added: “What I’m hearing is that if there is someone who is equally capable, or more, perhaps a new voice or perspective would be welcome. The Democratic Party has had so many missed opportunities for picking candidates at the right time. We don’t want to lose any more ground.”\n\nNot every Democrat calling for the party to make changes thinks age, alone, should be the new litmus test.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, was one of the first people to endorse Mr. Larson for a 15th term. In the Senate, he noted that Democratic Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 84, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, 76, were some of the loudest voices urging their colleagues to hold the line on demanding health care subsidies in order to reopen the government.\n\n“There are instances where some of our older generation members end up being some of our most serious fighters against totalitarianism,” said Mr. Murphy, who considers Mr. Larson a longtime mentor. “I look at Larson — he seems to be one of the people most willing to pick fights with Trump.”\n\nMr. Larson has had some breakout moments this year. He was placed on a list of Democratic lawmakers, compiled by the Department of Homeland Security, who have spoken out about abusive tactics used by ICE.\n\nAnd after Mr. Larson delivered an angry, red-faced tirade during a House committee hearing in which he accused Republicans of helping Elon Musk destroy Social Security, MS NOW host Rachel Maddow played his speech almost in full on air and lauded him for “ripping the bark off today about Social Security and what Republicans are really doing here.”\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, who prodded 78-year-old Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York to give up the top Democratic slot on the Judiciary Committee last year after a challenge based largely on Mr. Nadler’s advanced age, said that the question of who could no longer be effective in Congress was a case-by-case call.\n\n“I have a pretty high threshold of expectations for people doing the job,” he said. “The benefit of incumbency is people know your talents and your skills. Larson is a very effective actor.”\n\n(Mr. Nadler announced his retirement in September.)\n\nMr. Larson said the serious challengers he was facing meant that he was going to more campaign events and working harder to keep his seat than he had done in decades. On a recent Monday, he toured a local food bank to highlight how Mr. Trump had delayed aid to people on food stamps.\n\n“This is not sustainable, even though we’ve seen the good will of so many people during this time,” he said. “The only entity that can do the right thing in this instance is the federal government.”\n\nSome of Mr. Larson’s allies have noted that while Mr. Bronin, the former Hartford mayor, may be younger, he also has a strained relationship with labor groups in the state and is not necessarily the more progressive choice.\n\nStill, there are signs that he is making headway.\n\nA recent fund-raiser for Mr. Bronin in Washington drew a who’s who of longtime Democratic power players, including Alejandro Mayorkas, the former Homeland Security secretary; Jamie Gorelick, a veteran of President Bill Clinton’s Justice Department; Jon Finer, a former top State Department official; Jeremy Bash, the former chief of staff to Leon Panetta at the C.I.A.; and Gene Sperling, a former director of the National Economic Council.\n\nMr. Larson said he was focused on showing voters that he had been an effective fighter against Mr. Trump.\n\n“That’s the immediate change that’s on people’s minds,” he said. “Standing up to the bully.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/world/middleeast/israeli-strikes-gaza.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"13:26:07-05:00","title":"20 Killed in Israeli Strikes as Israel and Hamas Trade Blame Over Truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a U.S.-backed cease-fire agreement in October 2025, violence has flared between Israel and Hamas, with Israel launching strikes in Gaza City and Nuseirat killing at least 20 people, including civilians.

Mediators, including the United States, Egypt and Qatar, are currently working to secure a complete end to the war, disarm Hamas, and begin rebuilding Gaza.\n\nBut violence has repeatedly flared up in the weeks since, killing hundreds of Palestinians and at least three Israeli soldiers.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel accused Hamas of sending an armed gunman to fire at Israeli soldiers deployed in Gaza. As part of the cease-fire, Israel pulled back its forces but remained in control of about half the enclave.\n\nIn response, Israeli forces began striking in Gaza City and the central Gaza town of Nuseirat, killing at least 20 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does  not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHamas said in a statement that Israel was repeatedly violating the cease-fire by continuing to attack in Gaza.

A Hamas spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether any of its fighters had been killed.\n\nIsrael and Hamas say they are committed to maintaining the cease-fire, but have each accused one another of violating the truce. Mediators are rushing to shore up the cease-fire; this week the United Nations Security Council endorsed a resolution calling for an International Stabilization Force to enter, demilitarize and govern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said Gaza militants have opened fire on its soldiers several times, leading it to launch attacks across the enclave in retaliation.\n\nThose strikes have killed more than 300 Palestinians, including children, since the cease-fire went into effect last month, according to Gaza health officials.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of breaking the cease-fire by refusing to open the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, which Israeli officials had pledged to do as part of the truce. The Israeli government has said it will consider doing so based on whether Hamas returns the remaining three bodies of hostages still in Gaza, which it has yet to do.\n\nArab and U.S. mediators have also been discussing yet another thorny problem threatening the truce: Scores of Palestinian fighters are still stuck in underground tunnels behind Israeli military lines, blocked from leaving by Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Saturday it believed some of those fighters had clashed with its troops near the southern city of Rafah, adding that it had killed at least 11 militants it believed had likely left the tunnels in Rafah and sought to hide.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/science/lemurs-madagascar-eating.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"15:55:57-05:00","title":"Lemurs in Madagascar Face an Unexpected Killer","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A groundbreaking study reveals that over 10,000 lemurs have been sold for consumption across 17 cities in Madagascar over the past four years, primarily by affluent urban residents who view lemur meat as a status symbol, health food, and 'pure' delicacy.

They are beloved by children, who are entertained by lemur characters in cartoons and picture books.\n\nBut in their native Madagascar, the endangered animals are facing a growing threat: City-dwellers with cash to spare love to eat them. They say that the meat from fruit-eating lemur species tastes sweet and that consuming these primates promotes strength and good health. The meat from these tree-dwellers is valued for its cleanliness and “purity.” The startling revelation comes from the first-ever assessment of Madagascar’s urban lemur trade. Conducted over the past four years, it concludes that more than 10,000 lemurs were sold for pricey dishes across 17 cities in the country.\n\n“It’s shocking,” said Liliana Cortés Ortiz, the president of the International Primatological Society and a professor at the University of Michigan. This previously unrecognized issue requires international and governmental attention, she said.\n\nThough dining on wild species from African forests often evokes people trying to survive hunger in desperate situations, this new work suggests that people from a wealthier rung of society in Madagascar, those making perhaps thousands of U.S. dollars a year, are a distinct threat to these endangered primates. The findings were published Saturday in the journal Conservation Letters.\n\n“I knew there was hunting going on for subsistence and occasionally for restaurants, but the scale of this is just disgusting,” said Russell Mittermeier, the chief conservation officer of the international conservation group Re:wild, which helped fund the survey.\n\nCortni Borgerson, a primatologist at Montclair State University in New Jersey, and her co-authors conducted interviews with more than 2,600 lemur sellers, buyers or hunters. This urban consumption problem, she says, is “urgent and growing.” Lemur suppliers and buyers told her team that demand for the animals seemed to be increasing.\n\nMadagascar is the only place in the world where lemurs are found in the wild. In addition to being a major tourism draw, lemurs are essential seed dispersers and pollinators in the country’s forests.\n\nThe country outlawed lemur hunting more than 60 years ago, but subsistence hunting endures. The animals face additional threats from deforestation, climate change and trafficking for the pet trade.\n\nAnd, it turns out, humans are feasting on them in unexpected ways.\n\nThey’re showing up on dinner plates, served with rice and a side, in cities as much as 120 miles from their home forests. Almost 95 percent of the lemurs in the study were sold directly to clients. The rest were sold to restaurants or to middlemen who sold them to restaurants.\n\n“They would be consumed as a special treat at home or for a special occasion out at a restaurant, depending on lemur availability,” Dr. Borgerson said. They’re a status symbol that costs more than three times as much as beef, she says, and they are sometimes eaten for unproven medicinal benefits.\n\n“We are really surprised,” said Max Andonirina Fontaine, who served as Madagascar’s Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development until the country’s government dissolved in September. “It’s not an issue raised before.” In an interview days before the government collapsed, he said that the authorities intended to investigate the practice.\n\nMadagascar didn’t prosecute any cases specifically related to the consumption or hunting of lemurs in all of 2024 and 2025, according to Mr. Fontaine. A newly appointed minister in the current Madagascar government did not reply to emailed requests for comment.\n\nThe researchers found that brown and ruffed lemurs were being eaten the most. They’re relatively large, are considered to be tasty, and they’re not too difficult to catch.\n\nBrown lemurs are a diverse group and found all over the country. Most are caramel colored, with long, fluffy tails and bright orange eyes. They typically weigh around four to six pounds.\n\nRuffed lemurs, which include two species, are slightly larger and are found in the eastern part of the country. They are known for being particularly loud.\n\n“All these lemurs have been disappearing from many protected areas, and they’re declining rapidly where they’re left,” Dr. Borgerson said.\n\nMadagascar, a large island about 250 miles off the coast of East Africa, is one of the top regions in the world for biodiversity. It is also one of the most impoverished countries in the world, with United Nations figures suggesting that almost half the country’s children suffer from chronic malnutrition.\n\nWhile some people kill lemurs and other wild animals when other food sources are scarce, the new study shows dining on lemurs is not merely a problem of poverty.\n\nAll buyers and sellers included in the survey reported they were aware of the illegality of the trade and feared being caught, jailed or fined. But the economic benefits motivated their actions. They were also aware of how rare the animals were becoming. More than half of the interviewees said they expected to have fewer lemurs to trade in the future because of declining populations.\n\nCombating the lemur trade requires a consistent law enforcement focus on the people eating the meat, not the hunters, Dr. Borgerson said. Better regulation of shotguns and ammunition, and alternative economic opportunity development, would also help.\n\nThe researchers also want to reshape the perception of lemur meat with public campaigns focusing on disease risk from interacting with wild animals.\n\n“I agree, we need to work more on the demand than the supply side,” said Mr. Fontaine, the former government official. “You can catch the people catching lemurs in the forest, but if you arrest them, tomorrow they will be replaced.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/nyregion/judge-nechemya-weberman-resentence.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"03:00:01-05:00","title":"Orthodox Jewish Man Sentenced to 103 Years for Sex Abuse May Go Free","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nechemya Weberman, a 67-year-old unlicensed therapist from Brooklyn, was convicted in 2012 of 59 counts of child sexual abuse and sentenced to 103 years in prison — the longest ever given in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.

They say Mr. Gonzalez has bowed to years of relentless pressure from an influential voting bloc, and that an office that won a seminal conviction was now abdicating its duty in the same case.\n\n“This sends a devastating message,” said Boorey Deutsch, 38, the husband of the woman whom Mr. Weberman was convicted of abusing when she was a girl. “Politics matters more than protecting children.”\n\nMr. Gonzalez was elected in 2017 in a wave of liberal-minded prosecutors and ran unopposed in winning re-election this year. He has largely avoided the scrutiny of his counterpart Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, despite pursing many of the same policies, including re-evaluating cases that led to long prison sentences and, occasionally, recommending clemency.\n\nThat mission has meant revisiting cases like Mr. Weberman’s case.\n\nBefore going to trial, Mr. Weberman was offered a plea agreement under which he would have been sentenced to five years in prison. He refused it, was convicted and received the lengthy sentence.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Gonzalez wrote to Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor at the time, and asked that he consider commuting Mr. Weberman’s sentence. Though a “substantial period of incarceration was necessary,” Mr. Gonzalez wrote, Mr. Weberman had been “singled out for an unusually harsh punishment because his was a high-profile case.” (Mr. Cuomo did not act on the request.)\n\nMr. Gonzalez, in an interview on Friday, said his office stood by the conviction and he called Mr. Weberman’s crimes “horrific.” But he also said the original sentence departed unfairly from the norm and had been engineered to make an example of one man.\n\nHe added that victims would be less likely to report such crimes if they thought that members of ultra-Orthodox Jewish community would be treated unfairly at sentencing.\n\n“These excessive sentences have become a serious moral and policy failure in our criminal justice system,” Mr. Gonzalez said.\n\nFor supporters of Mr. Weberman’s victim, that he has continued to insist on his innocence and has never apologized disqualifies him for clemency.\n\n“It sends a strong message to victims of, ‘Don’t even try. You don’t stand a chance against our power,’” said Asher Lovy, the director of Za’akah, an organization that promotes awareness of sexual abuse in the Jewish community.\n\nMr. Weberman’s sentence was once unimaginable in a community where sex crime victims had long been intimidated. But it angered members of the Satmar Hasidic community, where Mr. Weberman was a respected figure.\n\nThe New York Times is not naming his victim because of the nature of abuse she faced.\n\nThe prosecution of Mr. Weberman unfolded at a politically charged time. The district attorney at the time, Charles J. Hynes, faced loud criticism that he had not prosecuted sexual abuse in the politically connected ultra-Orthodox community aggressively.\n\nUnder heavy scrutiny and facing re-election, Mr. Hynes took a hard line against Mr. Weberman after he decided to chance a trial.\n\nIn court, the victim testified about modesty committees that policed the behavior of young girls found to have broken the Satmar community’s austere rules. Parents of those who broke the rules had to send them to religious counselors.\n\nIt was in that context when the victim first encountered Mr. Weberman. She was 12 and had been referred to him for counseling by her religious school in the Williamsburg section. Her parents were told that unless they paid Mr. Weberman $150 an hour for his services, she would be expelled, according to a close family member who spoke with The Times in 2012.\n\nFor the next three years, Mr. Weberman sexually molested her and told her she would be expelled if she told anyone, according to the family member. The victim shared the accounts of abuse with a licensed therapist, who reported the accusations to the authorities.\n\nAt the trial, Mr. Weberman’s victim testified that during counseling sessions supposedly aimed at making her more religious, he had forced her to perform oral sex.\n\n“You played around with and destroyed lives as if they were your toys,” she told Mr. Weberman at his sentencing, “without the slightest bit of mercy.”\n\nAccording to Mr. Weberman and his lawyers, the girl concocted the accusations and reported him as an act of revenge.\n\nMr. Weberman was convicted in December 2012. After prosecutors called for the maximum possible sentence, Justice John G. Ingram of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn gave Mr. Weberman the longest sentence ever imposed against a member of the ultra-Orthodox community for sexually abusing a child.\n\nTo Mr. Weberman’s lawyers, the 103-year cumulative sentence on 59 counts was a wild departure, and Mr. Gonzalez agrees.\n\nHad Mr. Weberman’s sentences run concurrently, his lawyers wrote in a June court filing, his minimum sentence would have been five years, in line with punishments for similar crimes.\n\nInstead, Judge Ingram gave Mr. Weberman consecutive sentences. A state law capping prison terms for such crimes has already cut his sentence to 50 years, meaning he could be released at 97. That is still excessive, his lawyers argued in their filing.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Donna Aldea, a lawyer for Mr. Weberman, said his sentence was “unconstitutional” and that he could not be punished simply for exercising his right to go to a trial.\n\nMr. Weberman has maintained a loyal following in the Satmar community. In Yiddish language publications, he has been compared to Joseph from the Book of Genesis, who was falsely accused of rape. He has been visited in prison by prominent Satmar rabbis.\n\nAbout a year ago, more than a dozen of New York’s most powerful Jewish leaders wrote to Gov. Kathy Hochul, asking for Mr. Weberman’s immediate release.\n\nWhile condemning his crimes, the leaders wrote that Mr. Weberman had missed weddings, bar mitzvahs and baby naming ceremonies, and had been harshly punished “to set an example to the Orthodox Jewish community.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the dean of Yeshiva University’s rabbinical school, Hershel Schachter, released a video that had been posted on Instagram in which he expressed regret for signing the letter, whose existence was first reported by The Times of Israel. He said he was “misinformed” about it. He called Mr. Weberman a “public menace.”\n\n“I was misled from the beginning,” Mr. Schachter said.\n\nThough Mr. Weberman’s case revolves around one victim, additional accusers said he had sexually abused them, according to legal filings obtained by The Times.\n\nIn August 2012, before the trial, a Brooklyn prosecutor wrote in a filing that six other victims had approached the district attorney’s office to report that Mr. Weberman had sexually abused them in counseling sessions dating to the 1990s. Mr. Weberman was not charged in those cases.\n\nMs. Aldea said Mr. Weberman’s “extreme” sentence was not justified “by uncharged, unproven, and anonymous allegations.”\n\nBefore and at trial, the victim faced persistent harassment from members of the community. After Mr. Weberman was arrested in 2011, hundreds of Hasidic men held a fund-raiser for his defense and hung posters accusing the girl of libel. Four Satmar men were charged with trying to buy the silence of the victim and Mr. Deutsch, who was then her boyfriend, for $500,000.\n\nMr. Deutsch said that he and his wife had moved out of Williamsburg after getting married to “stay away from the community.”\n\nTo Mr. Deutsch, the question of whether Mr. Weberman’s sentence was too harsh is irrelevant. He worries that if released, Mr. Weberman will be welcomed as a hero.\n\n“Every child molester should be made an example of,” Mr. Deutsch said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/opinion/ukraine-russia-negotiations-trump-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"14:46:33-05:00","title":"Trump’s Neville Chamberlain Prize","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article critiques a proposed peace deal between the United States and Russia, championed by Donald Trump and his aides, that would require Ukraine to cede control of eastern regions like Donetsk and Luhansk to Russia, restrict its military, and accept a deal with no consultation with allies or President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Unfortunately, though, it is not that Nobel peace prize he so covets. It is the “Neville Chamberlain Peace Prize” — awarded by history to the leader of the country that most flagrantly sells out its allies and its values to an aggressive dictator.\n\nThis prize richly deserves to be shared by Trump’s many “secretaries of state” — Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio and Dan Driscoll — who together negotiated the surrender of Ukraine to Vladimir Putin’s demands without consulting Ukraine or our European allies in advance — and then told Ukraine it had to accept the plan by Thanksgiving.\n\nThat is this coming Thursday.\n\nIf Ukraine is, indeed, forced to surrender to the specific terms of this “deal” by then, Thanksgiving will no longer be an American holiday. It will become a Russian holiday. It will become a day of thanks that victory in Putin’s savage and misbegotten war against Ukraine’s people, which has been an utter failure — morally, militarily, diplomatically and economically — was delivered to Russia not by the superiority of its arms or the virtue of its claims, but by an American administration.\n\nHow do you say “Thanksgiving” in Russian?\n\nTo all the gentlemen who delivered this turkey to Moscow, I can offer only one piece of advice: Be under no illusions. Neither Fox News nor the White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt will be writing the history of this deal. If you force it upon Ukraine as it is, every one of your names will live in infamy alongside that of Chamberlain, who is remembered today for only one thing:\n\nHe was the British prime minister who advocated the policy of appeasement, which aimed to avoid war with Adolf Hitler’s Germany by giving in to his demands. This was concretized in the 1938 Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain, along with others in Europe, allowed Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain boasted it would secure “peace for our time.” A year later, Poland was invaded, starting World War II and leading to Chamberlain’s resignation — and his everlasting shame.\n\nThis Trump plan, if implemented, will do the modern equivalent. By rewarding Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine based on his obsession with making it part of Mother Russia, the U.S. will be putting the whole European Union under Putin’s thumb. Trump’s message to our allies will be clear: Don’t provoke Putin, because as long as I am commander in chief, the United States will pay no price and we will bear no burden in the defense of your freedom.\n\nWhich is why, if this plan is forced on Ukraine as is, we will need to add a new verb to the diplomatic lexicon: “Trumped” — to be sold out by an American president, for reasons none of his citizens understand (but surely there are reasons). And history will never forget the men who did it — Donald Trump, Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio, Dan Driscoll — for their shame will be everlasting.\n\nAs a Wall Street Journal editorial on Friday put it: “Mr. Trump may figure he can finally wash his hands of Ukraine if Europe and Ukraine reject his offer. He’s clearly sick of dealing with the war. But appeasing Mr. Putin would haunt the rest of his presidency. If Mr. Trump thinks American voters hate war, wait until he learns how much they hate dishonor. … A bad deal in Ukraine would broadcast to U.S. enemies that they can seize what they want with force or nuclear blackmail or by pressing on until America loses interest.”\n\nMind you, I am not at all against a negotiated solution. Indeed, from the beginning of this war I have made the point that it will end only with a “dirty deal.” But it cannot be a filthy deal, and the Trump plan is what history will call a filthy deal.\n\nEven before you get to the key details, think of how absurd it is for Trump to strike a deal with Putin and not even include Ukraine and our European allies in the negotiations until they were virtually done. Trump then declared it must be accepted by Thursday, as if Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has a parliament that he needs to win acceptance from, could possibly do so by then, even if he wanted to.\n\nAs my Times colleague David Sanger observed in his analysis of the plan’s content: “Many of the 28 points in the proposed Russia-Ukraine peace plan offered by the White House read like they had been drafted in the Kremlin. They reflect almost all Mr. Putin’s maximalist demands.”\n\nUkraine would have to formally give Russia all the territory it has declared for itself in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The United States would recognize that as Russian territory. No NATO forces could be based inside Ukraine to ensure that Russia could never invade again. The Ukrainian military would be capped at 600,000 troops, a 25 percent cut from current levels, and it would be barred from possessing long-range weapons that could reach Russia. Kyiv would receive vague security guarantees from the U.S. against a Russian re-invasion (but who in Ukraine, or Moscow, would trust them coming from Trump?).\n\nUnder the Trump plan, $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be put toward U.S.-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine, and the U.S. would then receive 50 percent of the profits from that investment. (Yes, we are demanding half of the profits generated by a fund to rebuild a ravaged nation.)\n\nTrump, facing blowback from allies, Congress and Ukraine, said Saturday that this was not his “final offer” but added, if Zelensky refuses to accept the terms, “then he can continue to fight his little heart out.” As always with Trump, he is all over the place — and as always, ready to stick it to Zelensky, the guy fighting for his country’s freedom, and never to Putin, the guy trying to take Ukraine’s freedom away.\n\nWhat would an acceptable dirty deal look like?\n\nIt would freeze the forces in place, but never formally cede any seized Ukrainian territory. It would insist that European security forces, backed by U.S. logistics, be stationed along the cease-fire line as a symbolic tripwire against any Russian re-invasion. It would require Russia to pay a significant amount of money to cover all the carnage it has inflicted on Ukraine — and keep Moscow isolated and under sanctions until it does — and include a commitment by the European Union to admit Ukraine as a member as soon as it is ready, without Russian interference.\n\nThis last point is vital. It is so the Russian people would have to forever look at their Ukrainian Slavic brothers and sisters in the thriving European Union, while they are stuck in Putin’s kleptocracy. That contrast is Putin’s best punishment for this war and the thing that would cause him the most trouble after it is over.\n\nThis would be a dirty deal that history would praise Trump for — getting the best out of a less than perfect hand, by using U.S. leverage on both sides, as he did in Gaza.\n\nBut just using U.S. leverage on Ukraine is a filthy deal — folding our imperfect hand to a Russian leader who is playing a terrible one.\n\nThere is a term for that in poker: sucker.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2025-11-22T19:58:41-05:00\n\nDaniel Nepstad first set fire to the Amazon rainforest in 1985.\n\nHe was a young researcher at the time, studying how tropical forests remained so lush, even during the dry season. “I became obsessed with the incredible ability of these forests to endure drought,” he said.\n\nAfter years of experiments, including numerous attempts to intentionally light the Amazon aflame, he arrived at a surprising conclusion: “Forests are pretty hard to burn down.”\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\nAs climate change has pushed global temperatures to record levels, the Amazon has become increasingly combustible, creating years of rolling environmental crisis.\n\nPersistent heat makes it harder for vegetation to retain moisture, which in turn makes it easier for forests to burn. On top of that, the vast majority of fires in the Amazon are set by humans, particularly by farmers clearing land for agriculture. Fire begets fire.\n\nLast year, a record amount of tropical primary forests burned around the globe, according to the World Economic Forum, five times as much as the prior year’s level of forest loss. In the Amazon, fires consumed an area larger than California.\n\nNow Mr. Nepstad is returning to the Amazon to try to stop fires in a region that scientists have identified as a critical bulwark against global warming.\n\n“Fire is the biggest threat to the Amazon, but it’s also a problem that’s possible to solve,” Mr. Nepstad said. “This is the biggest climate solution that could happen over the next new years.”\n\nWorking through his own nonprofit organization, the Earth Innovation Institute, along with a coalition of other groups, local business leaders and international research groups, Mr. Nepstad is trying to encourage small shifts in behavior that might help stop fires before they begin.\n\nThe changes he is asking farmers to make can be modest: planting different crops, letting forests return and pooling resources to afford machinery that can clear land instead of resorting to intentional burns. Yet in the aggregate, he believes these modifications can have a major effect.\n\nOn a recent weekend, ahead of his participation the United Nations climate summit in Belém, Brazil, Mr. Nepstad, a tropical ecologist, returned to Paragominas, the city where he began his research 41 years ago.\n\nMr. Nepstad and his team spent days traveling to remote farms with just a few dozen head of cattle and to large ranches with thousands of cows, explaining how different farming practices could reduce the risk of fire and help land be more resilient when flames arrive.\n\nFires in Brazil have grown worse in recent years. Last year, they swept across the Pantanal, the world’s largest wetlands. After seasonal rains failed to materialize last year, a record number of fires charred the Amazon. Five years earlier, in 2019, another bad fire season consumed vast tracts of land.\n\nAll these blazes present myriad challenges. When virgin rainforest burns, it takes a toll on biodiversity. When agricultural land burns, it affects the livelihoods of the more than 40 million people who live in the Amazon.\n\nThe fires also release vast quantities of stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, accelerating global warming.\n\nThis marks a stark reversal of an age-old trend. In recent centuries, the Amazon acted like a filter, absorbing many of the planet-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\n\nBut some of this area is no longer a reliable carbon sink. In recent years, parts of the Amazon that have been developed into farmland, including the area where Mr. Nepstad started his career, now produce more carbon dioxide than they absorb.\n\nLeft unchecked, scientists warn that the loss of Amazon to fire and deforestation could lead to irreversible changes, leading to much of the forest giving way to grasslands and further accelerating global temperature rise.\n\n“We have had record-breaking fires in the Amazon,” said Carlos Nobre, a Brazilian scientist who has spent his career studying the region. If Brazilians aren’t able to get the fires under control, Dr. Nobre said, “the Amazon will cross the tipping point.”\n\nMr. Nepstad set out from Belém at 5 a.m. on a Saturday morning and started driving south in a pickup truck, crossing the Guamá River as the sun rose.\n\nA century ago, this part of the Amazon was largely untouched. Thick forest covered the nearly half-million square miles that today make up the state of Pará, which sits on the Equator and includes the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\nThat all changed in the second half of the 20th century, when the Brazilian government began building a series of highways across the rainforest in a bid to open up land for economic development. And by the late 1970s, more farmers were intentionally setting fires to clear land for agriculture.\n\nAfter a seven-hour drive through fields of soybeans destined for China, palm trees that will become palm oil and eucalyptus trees that will be turned into paper, Mr. Nepstad pulled into a the tiny village of Formosa, a poor settlement deep in Amazonian farmland.\n\nFor years, the farmers in Formosa and other nearby settlements have intentionally set fires to clear their land for cattle ranching and crops like cassava. But those fires are increasingly difficult to control, and have been escaping and spreading to nearby forests and farms.\n\nInside a community building, 50 people had gathered to listen to Mr. Nepstad and his team pitch their fire prevention plan.\n\nOne of Mr. Nepstad’s partners was Maxiely Scaramussa Bergamin, the president of the rural farmer’s union. Ms. Bergamin spoke about the benefits of growing in-demand crops like açaí and cacao. In addition to selling for a premium, these plants can displace cattle and, in turn, help stop intentional fires from spreading.\n\nA team of firefighters addressed the audience, explaining how they could use a new mobile alert system to raise the alarm if they spotted an uncontrolled fire burning nearby.\n\nFinally Mr. Nepstad explained how his history of research had led him to arrive at this singular focus on stopping fires. The goal, he said, was to kick-start a virtuous cycle of farming practices that would reduce wildfires. “If small holders can shift to systems that don’t need fire, everybody is better off,” he said.\n\nAfter the community served its guests a lunch of açaí, pork and plantains, Mr. Nepstad and his team reconvened to hear stories from the farmers about their experience with fire.\n\nGleyciany Sobral de Souza said that last year, she watched five hectares of açaí burn, losing crops that could have been worth as much as $100,000. “I’ve lost it,” she said. “When it’s dry, it doesn’t grow back.”\n\nFrancisca Risalva Romao de Souza, another farmer, said recent blazes had charred her land and killed a cow. “People are more afraid to use fires these days,” she said.\n\nAnd Waldir Silva, who has used fire his whole life, said he is trying not to anymore. “The biggest challenge is to balance production with preservation of the environment,” he said. “You can’t balance anything with fire.”\n\nChanging habits in villages like Formosa will take time, but Mr. Nepstad says he has confidence that reform is possible.\n\nThirty years ago, Paragominas was once the largest producer of timber in the world. There were more than 300 sawmills operating as loggers cleared the Amazon for lumber.\n\nToday most of the sawmills are closed, and bit by bit, the forest is slowly coming back. In 2008, 64 percent of the county was covered in forest. Today, that figure is up to 68 percent.\n\nBut the fires are never far away. It had not rained in a month, and the land was poised to burn.\n\nAs the conversations wound down, a group of firefighters who receive funding from Mr. Nepstad’s nonprofit organization put a drone up in the air. Scanning the horizon through a tiny monitor, one of firefighters saw smoke in the distance.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, they had packed up their gear, piled into their truck and headed toward the hot spot.\n\nStarting in 1984, Mr. Nepstad began his research career on a cattle ranch outside Paragominas called Fazenda Vitória.\n\nThe owner of the land, Percio Barros de Lima, raises thousands of cattle on a vast expanse of pastures. Yet in the middle of the property is an island of almost untouched rainforest, just a few square miles of the Amazon as it once was.\n\nIt was on this land that Mr. Nepstad discovered that the roots of Amazonian trees stretch down more than 20 meters, and that when covered with forest, the land acts like a sponge, retaining moisture that can help it endure lengthy droughts and even some fires.\n\nThat led to a series of experiments where Mr. Nepstad tried to burn the forest down, sometimes throwing lit cigarettes into piles of leaves on the ground to see if they would ignite. They almost never did — tropical moisture swallowed up the sparks in a matter of minutes.\n\nAfter visiting Formosa, Mr. Nepstad returned to Fazenda Vitória for the first time in a decade. As he emerged from the truck, he and Mr. de Lima embraced, then set out for a walk into the trees.\n\nAlthough Mr. Nepstad had encouraged Mr. de Lima to preserve the forest over the years, he was unsure what he would find as he returned.\n\nMr. de Lima said he had plenty of opportunities to wipe away the rainforest in his backyard. During the heyday of the local logging industry, it could have been cleared for timber. And like so many of his neighbors, he could have cleared the land with fire to make way for more cattle.\n\nBut as he set out, Mr. Neptsad was heartened to find his old living laboratory intact. He pointed out a giant ipe tree, a sign of original forest, with a towering crown that burst through the canopy. Nearby was an enormous piquia that Mr. Nepstad estimated to be between 500 and 700 years old.\n\nWhile this patch of rainforest is small, it is still home to tapirs, jaguars, ocelots, anteaters, porcupines, bush dogs, howler monkeys, scarlet macaws, toucans, vampire bats, sloths and boa constrictors.\n\nMr. de Lima said he was proud of this small act of conservation. “I had a chance to chop it down and turn it into housing, and I’m so relieved that I didn’t,” he said. “Whenever I am in this forest, I feel this contentment.”\n\nBut last year, a blaze came to the edge of the forest. It was unclear how it started, but a likely culprit was a discarded cigarette from a passing truck that sparked a major blaze in today’s hotter, drier Amazon.\n\n“Fire is the biggest challenge now,” Mr. de Lima said. “We’d never seen a drought like last year.”\n\nMr. Nepstad confessed he was surprised to see the tall trees still standing.\n\n“I assumed this forest would all be gone,” he said. Mr. de Lima, he said, “had dollar signs in his eyes back then, but he became this incredible land steward.”\n\nEven more surprising was the fact that there was new forest where there had been none just a decade ago. As Mr. de Lima has worked to concentrate his cattle on a smaller area of land, he has let the trees reclaim former pasture. Previously barren stream beds were filling in with vegetation, and more animals were returning to the land.\n\nDecades after he began his work, the Amazon had taught Mr. Nepstad another lesson. “One of the surprises for me is just how tough the forest is,” he said. “It keeps bouncing back.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/arts/dorothy-vogel-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"16:15:07-05:00","title":"Dorothy Vogel, Librarian With a Vast Art Collection, Dies at 90","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dorothy Vogel, a librarian and art collector, and her husband Herbert, amassed a vast collection of over 4,000 works from avant-garde artists like Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, Richard Tuttle, and Nam June Paik, despite having no formal art training or wealth.

Dorothy Vogel, Librarian With a Vast Art Collection, Dies at 90\n\nPublished: 2025-11-22T16:15:07-05:00\n\nDorothy Vogel, a librarian who, with her postal-clerk husband, Herbert, bought thousands of works from future art stars like Sol LeWitt and Donald Judd, stashing them in their cramped one-bedroom New York apartment and eventually handing over the entire collection to the National Gallery of Art without ever turning a profit, died on Nov. 10 in Manhattan. She was 90.\n\nHer death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Kathryn Obler, a cousin. Ms. Vogel left no immediate survivors.\n\nThat the Vogels, who were modest in dress and bearing, would come to take their place as benefactors alongside Rockefellers and Mellons was every bit as unlikely as it was that some of the works they collected — like the tiny snippet of frayed rope by the Post-Minimalist artist Richard Tuttle — would land in one of the world’s premier art museums, alongside Vermeers and Van Goghs.\n\nThroughout their decades as collectors, Ms. Vogel worked at the Brooklyn Public Library as a reference librarian, and Mr. Vogel, a high school dropout from Harlem, did the night shift at a post office sorting mail. Their formal training in art, such as it was, consisted of the art classes Mr. Vogel took at New York University as a young man and a few painting lessons the couple took together.\n\nTheir rent-controlled apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side functioned as a fine-art storage locker as well as an exhibition space. Stacked on the floor and crammed into closets were some 4,000 works by luminaries like the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein; the photographers Cindy Sherman and Lorna Simpson; the German sculptor and performance artist Joseph Beuys; the Minimalist Robert Mangold; and the video art pioneer Nam June Paik.\n\nThe couple did have their limits, however. Contrary to art-world legend, “we never kept art in our oven,” Ms. Vogel said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. “We didn’t set out to live bizarrely.”\n\nWhile works by the artists the Vogels favored often sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, their collection was quite literally priceless, in the sense that none of it ever went to market. “I didn’t make a $20 bill outright on any artist,” Herbert Vogel, who died in 2012, told “60 Minutes” in 1995.\n\nMs. Vogel added, “In the 1980s, there was a big explosion in the art market, where the prices went very high — unrealistically. Then all of a sudden, it dropped. But we were not part of that. We didn’t sell.”\n\nInstead, in 1992, the Vogels began donating their vast holdings to the National Gallery in Washington in return for a small annual stipend — a tiny fraction of the collection’s value.\n\n“We like the idea of giving it to the nation,” Ms. Vogel said in 1995. They also liked the idea that the museum “was free, it didn’t charge admission,” she added, and that “once you give them something, they will not sell it.”\n\nIn 2008, the couple partnered with the National Gallery to donate 50 works to a museum or gallery in each of the 50 states, an endeavor chronicled in the 2013 documentary film “Herb & Dorothy 50x50,” Megumi Sasaki’s follow-up to her 2009 film about the couple, “Herb & Dorothy.”\n\nIf the Vogels did not make any money off their collection, they did not spend much on it, either. With civil-service incomes, the Vogels lived frugally, didn’t own a car and often ate TV dinners. As for art, they bought what they could afford — usually at a discount, from underground artists — and sometimes received it free of charge.\n\nIn the early 1960s, “Pop Art was already too expensive, and so was Abstract Expressionism,” Ms. Vogel said in “Herb & Dorothy.” “So if you wanted to buy art, the only thing we could afford would be the Minimal. And we had no competitors.”\n\nBack then, conceptual art was so new that the couple couldn’t tell “how good it was or bad it was,” Mr. Vogel said. The Photorealist painter Chuck Close was more certain, saying of them in the documentary, “They like the most unlikable art.”\n\nYears later, many people were still baffled. In the “60 Minutes” segment, the reporter Mike Wallace toured their apartment with a quizzical expression, pausing in disbelief when he saw a three-inch stretch of ordinary white rope nailed to the wall next to the front door — a 1974 original by Mr. Tuttle called “3rd Rope Piece.” (It’s now housed at the National Gallery.)\n\n“That’s a work of art?” Mr. Wallace asked, both a question and a jab.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with HuffPost, Ms. Vogel allowed that Mr. Tuttle’s “work is difficult, and people have to see it a few times to get into it.”\n\nShe added: “A lot of the work from the collection is like that: At first glance, it’s hard, but you see it again and again and again, and it grows on you.”\n\nDorothy Faye Hoffman was born on May 14, 1935, in Elmira, N.Y., the younger of two children of Edward Hoffman, who sold paper goods and novelties, and Anna (Kantrowitz) Hoffman.\n\nAfter graduating from Elmira Free Academy, she enrolled at the University at Buffalo and later at Syracuse University, where she received a bachelor’s degree in library science. She went on to earn a master’s degree in the same subject from the University of Denver.\n\nSeeking culture and adventure, she moved to New York with a friend in about 1958. Three years later, she met her future husband, already an eager art enthusiast. The couple married in 1962 and began dabbling in art, starting with painting classes to test their skills.\n\n“One day, we looked up and realized that the other artists were better than we were,” Ms. Vogel said in a 2017 interview with the Establishing Shot blog, published by Indiana University, “and that we were better at collecting than painting.”\n\nMr. Vogel began stopping in at the Cedar Bar (later Tavern) in Greenwich Village, an artists’ haunt, where he listened to Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko and Franz Kline expound on their theories. Before long, the couple were scouting around for up-and-coming artists who were venturing even further into unexplored territory.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the Vogels had become a known quantity on New York’s avant-garde scene, although some artists did not quite understand their methods — or means.\n\nIn 1971, for example, the couple agreed to spend three months cat-sitting for the Bulgarian-born artist Christo, who was becoming famous for his monumental works of environmental art, and his wife and collaborator Jeanne-Claude. In exchange, the artists gave them a framed prototype collage of the project Christo was then working on, “Valley Curtain,” a vast stretch of orange nylon that walled off the Rifle Gap in Colorado like a dam.\n\nThat was not the deal the artists had hoped for at the outset; they originally assumed that the Vogels were wealthy collectors. When the Vogels first contacted them, Jeanne-Claude took the phone call, she recounted in “Herb & Dorothy”: “I put my hand on the phone and said, ‘Christo, it’s the Vogels. We’re going to pay the rent.’”\n\n“They didn’t know,” Ms. Vogel responded, “that we could barely pay the rent ourselves.”\n\n"}]}
