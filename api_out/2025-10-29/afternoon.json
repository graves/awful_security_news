  \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has said it is “pretty clear” the US Constitution does not permit him to run for the third term in office, after days of speculation prompted by claims from allies there was a plan to let him do just that.\n \n\n   \n  “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had,” he told reporters on board Air Force One as he flew to South Korea where he is attending a regional summit as part of a whirlwind tour of Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “And, you know, based on what I read, I guess I’m not allowed to run so we’ll see what happens,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday  told reporters  he had spoken with Trump about the possibility of president seeking a third-term but he sees no path for it as any change to the US Constitution would be well after Trump has left office.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a great run. But I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about, the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that,” Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked how that conversation played out, Trump told reporters on Air Force One: “I don’t want to even talk about that, because, you know, the sad thing is, I have my highest numbers that I’ve ever had.”\n \n\n   \n  He later added: “I would say that if you read it, [the Constitution] it’s pretty clear, I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad. But we have a lot of great people.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump 2028 hats, Bannon interview\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously joked about running for a third term and  Trump 2028 hats  are on display in a room near the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  That attention intensified last week when The Economist published an interview with Steve Bannon, a MAGA influencer and former Trump adviser, who claimed “there is a plan” for Trump to run for a third term.\n \n\n   \n  Bannon is notably far less close to the president and his team than he was during Trump’s first term, and some White House officials viewed his comments as an attempt to draw attention to himself.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s quickly throwing cold water on the suggestion underscores how little support Trump would have if he actually tried to move forward with it, even among key Republican party figures.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also recently ruled out one proposed end-run around the Constitution, saying it would be “too cute” for him to run as vice president in order to later ascend back into the White House after the elected president resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the people wouldn’t like that because it’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right,” he said, although he tried to reserve the legal right to do it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/sport/basketball-nba-michael-jordan-load-management-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00-04:00","title":"Michael Jordan disapproves of 'load management' in today’s basketball and 3 things you missed from Tuesday’s NBA action","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michael Jordan expresses disapproval of 'load management' in modern basketball, criticizing the practice of healthy players skipping games to avoid fatigue, citing his own legendary performance through illness in the 1997 NBA Finals.

NBA action \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:33 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If there’s anyone who knows what it takes to win, it’s  Michael Jordan .\n \n\n   \n  Arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan won six  NBA  championships and five MVP awards during his storied spell with the Chicago Bulls.\n \n\n   \n  But looking at today’s landscape, Jordan isn’t overjoyed by the current trend of players missing games in order to protect their bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on Tuesday’s segment of “MJ: Insights to Excellence” on NBC, Jordan was asked for his opinion on “load management,” which is when a healthy player strategically misses a game in order to avoid injuries or prevent fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  “Well, it shouldn’t be needed, first and foremost,” Jordan said. “I never wanted to miss a game because it was an opportunity to prove. It was something that I felt like the fans are there that watch me play. I want to impress that guy way up on top who probably worked his (butt) off to get a ticket or to get money to buy the ticket.”\n \n\n   \n  Jordan highlighted his iconic “ Flu Game ” in the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz as an example of him going to extreme lengths to ensure he was on the court.\n \n\n   \n  Despite suffering apparent flu-like symptoms the night before and during the game, Jordan – through sheer strength of will and determination – scored 38 points to help his Chicago Bulls win 90-88 in Game 5 and put his Bulls one game away from the NBA title.\n \n\n   \n  “I was going to find a way to get out there, even if I was a decoy,” the 62-year-old said. “Well, once I got out there, you never know how – pushing yourself – you never know what happens, right?\n \n\n   \n  “Next thing you know, the emotions, the situation, the need of the team. All those things catapulted me to: ‘I’m going to gut this thing out.’”\n \n\n   \n  The league has gone to lengths to incentivize players to appear in as many games as possible during a season, including introducing criteria which disqualifies them from end-of-season awards if they don’t feature in enough games.\n \n\n   \n    Thunder stay unbeaten in title defense\n \n\n   \n  Around the league, there were five games played on Tuesday night, including the defending champions taking the floor to continue their lightning start to their title defense.\n \n\n   \n  The Oklahoma City Thunder stayed undefeated with a 107-101 victory over the Sacramento Kings at Paycom Center.\n \n\n   \n  Reigning MVP  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  led the way for the Thunder with 31 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks, while Aaron Wiggins and Ajay Mitchell both added 18 points.\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who slip to 1-3 with the loss, led at halftime and even held a seven-point advantage in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But some key buckets down the stretch from Oklahoma City put the champs in front with just 2:33 left in the game as they improve to 5-0 and continue to show why they’re still the team to beat in the NBA this season.\n \n\n   \n    Antetokounmpo outduels Brunson in potential East playoff preview\n \n\n   \n  The Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks have been two of the Eastern Conference’s heavyweights in recent years, and Tuesday’s clash showed why they could be set for a playoff meeting later in the season.\n \n\n   \n  The two met at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee and the two stars on display – Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks and Jalen Brunson of the Knicks – shone brightly.\n \n\n   \n  Antetokounmpo had 37 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and two blocks while Brunson had 36 points on 56% shooting from the field as Milwaukee erased a 12-point halftime deficit to win 121-111.\n \n\n   \n  It was a noteworthy victory for the Bucks who have struggled recently against the Knicks; New York had beaten Milwaukee five straight times before Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, the “Greek Freak” spoke about how meaningful the victory was as his Bucks improved to 3-1.\n \n\n   \n  “For sure, it was a lot extra,” Antetokounmpo told reporters. “They swept us last year. They swept us. They were better than us last year. We didn’t make it tough on them. It was very easy. As a leader of this team, I remember. I don’t forget things.”\n \n\n   \n  Milwaukee’s fourth quarter comeback came after a scary moment for the Knicks when Brunson appeared to injure his groin when scrambling for a loose ball.\n \n\n   \n  He remained in the game but moved gingerly and, just seconds later, he fell backwards in clear pain, causing a turnover which Antetokounmpo turned into a dunk at the other end to level the score.\n \n\n   \n  Brunson played out the loss, but his injury status is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n    Warriors beat Clippers with defensive masterclass\n \n\n   \n  The Golden State Warriors have begun the new season strongly and kept it rolling with a convincing 98-79 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n \n\n   \n  The Warriors leaned on their stifling defense for the victory, holding the Clippers to 36.6% shooting from the floor and 18.2% from beyond the arc; Draymond Green had three steals and Steph Curry had two.\n \n\n   \n  With that defensive structure providing a platform, Golden State’s stars performed on the offensive end, with Jimmy Butler pouring in 21 points and Curry adding 19.\n \n\n   \n  “Challenging every shot, keeping them off the free throw line,” Butler said of the team’s defensive effort. “It always helps to make shots so we can get back in transition.\n \n\n   \n  “Guys are confident, happy, playing some great basketball.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday, the Warriors had lost their last seven games to the Clippers. They improve to 4-1 with the win while the Clippers fall to 2-2.\n \n\n   \n  In the victory, Butler surpassed the 16,000-point mark in the NBA, doing so in his 15th season in the league.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/trump-xi-meeting-agenda-vis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Xi are set for a high-stakes summit.

But with SNAP benefits set to halt in the next few days, Gabrielle finds herself stretching her family’s limited finances in order to fill her refrigerator.\n \n\n   \n  “SNAP benefits are a must right now,” she said, adding her fiancé’s workload has been slow and she’s currently out of work herself.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in online forums usually reserved for finding handyman recommendations and lost pets, or buying and selling gently used belongings, neighbors are stepping up for one another as “grocery buddies,” creating a patchwork solution for vulnerable families across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how it works: Neighbors post on social media in community groups or public forums about their willingness to be a “grocery buddy” and help a family at risk of losing SNAP benefits. The poster asks those interested to send them a private message. Together, they find a grocery solution that makes sense for both parties.\n \n\n   \n  Assistance may look different for each pairing: In some cases, “grocery buddies” do the shopping, while in others, they accompany one another to the supermarket and shop together. Some “grocery buddies” provide their counterparts gift cards, giving them agency and control in a time of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the grassroots effort has spread, as messages offering and seeking assistance are cut, copied and pasted throughout communities big and small, connecting neighbors and finding those in need tangible help.\n \n\n   \n  This week, faced with the prospect of losing SNAP assistance and the stress of the holidays around the corner, Gabrielle, a West Virginia resident, reluctantly raised her hand in a community Facebook group.\n \n\n   \n  “I kind of almost didn’t want to comment because I knew other people were going to see it,” Gabrielle said, adding she didn’t want to be judged based on her situation.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, she decided it was worth a shot if it meant helping her family.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s what I would want done for me’\n \n\n   \n  A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, SNAP provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of  $188 per person , as of May. But amid the government shutdown, the US Department of Agriculture has said it  doesn’t have the funds  to pay $8 billion in food stamp benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  When beneficiaries will feel the impact varies, since states typically provide the benefits on a rolling basis during the month. Some will miss their payments as soon as Saturday, while others won’t be hit until later in November.\n \n\n   \n  There aren’t many good alternatives: While Americans can turn to food pantries and other food assistance programs, recent years have seen these groups under pressure from rising food prices and increased need.\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, community aid is going to be very important,” Micah Iverson, a resident of Hatteras Island, North Carolina, told CNN. “At the end of the day, we’re all on the same team here.”\n \n\n   \n  Iverson posted on Sunday about his desire to serve as a “grocery buddy” for someone in his tight-knit community. He was floored by the responses of people in need, he said, but also the willingness of others to help further his cause and donate additional funds.\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor of Iverson’s reached out to him on Facebook and connected him with his grocery buddy, a single mother of four. After a few messages were exchanged, the 31-year-old went to his local Food Lion and ticked away at the items on the mom’s grocery list.\n \n\n   \n  To pay, Iverson said he used a $300 gift card he won during office trivia, turning it into a fridge full of food.\n \n\n   \n  Later that evening, within hours of his initial post, Iverson was dropping off a trunk full of groceries to the mom after she got off work, he said. Upon meeting, the strangers – now friends – “hugged it out” as tears filled his eyes, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s what I would want done for me,” Iverson said, adding he and his husband plan on helping the same family﻿   as long as their own financial situation allows.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I encourage others to consider this if you can’\n \n\n   \n  Kristin Schmidt knows what it’s like to be hungry and on the receiving end of a wholesome meal. Now, she’s honored to be the one doing the giving.\n \n\n   \n  The minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Silver Spring, Maryland, told CNN she was inspired by a friend’s social media post looking for a “grocery buddy” and decided to do the same in a Facebook group for local moms.\n \n\n   \n  “If SNAP benefits run out in November, I would be happy to provide groceries for you and/or your family,” she wrote, adding, “I can only afford to take on one grocery buddy, but I encourage others to consider this if you can.”\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help from SNAP, according to the latest data from the US Department of Agriculture. That statistic haunted Schmidt, who said she would be unable to sleep at night if she didn’t do something to help.\n \n\n   \n  Her motivation “comes out of a deep, core belief in the preciousness of every single person,” she said, “and wanting to make sure that the people in my neighborhood have what they need – just as a basic human right.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few days, the mother of three was overwhelmed by the number of comments on her original post. And she said she was inundated with messages from other people wanting to offer help to their neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting and connecting in person, Schmidt said she plans to continue supporting her new “grocery buddy” – a disabled grandmother relying on SNAP to feed her grandson – through supermarket gift cards.\n \n\n   \n  “My community would be less if she didn’t get the support that she needs,” Schmidt said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Gabrielle hasn’t yet found a “grocery buddy” to help with her family’s immediate needs.\n \n\n   \n  But she remains hopeful – and grateful that, through another community Facebook post, she was connected with a neighbor who offered to cover her family’s Thanksgiving meal.\n \n\n   \n  For now, she said, that’s one less worry on her plate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/abby-zwerner-teacher-shooting-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:48:00-04:00","title":"Trial Begins in $40 Million Lawsuit Over School Shooting by 6-Year-Old Student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former assistant principal at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, is facing a $40 million civil lawsuit and a separate criminal trial after a 6-year-old student shot first-grade teacher Abby Zwerner in January 2023.

But the group expects that Canadian travel to the United States will drop to 15.7 million this year, a 22% decline.\n \n\n   \n  Three days of the World Series games aren’t going to make up for that estimated loss – but they are driving   some travel from Canadians.\n \n\n   \n  Ticket resale service StubHub estimates that 8% of the tickets it sold to the three World Series games in Los Angeles went to Canadian customers. SeatGeek, Major League Baseball’s official reseller, estimates that 3% of its LA game sales are to Canadians.\n \n\n   \n  Those figures likely represent thousands of Los Angeles World Series tickets over three days, though neither company releases specific ticket sales numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Living in Vancouver, Murray finds it easier to see the Jays in Seattle than in Toronto. But he passed up regular season games there this year. He also passed up once-frequent US trips elsewhere to see his team.\n \n\n   \n  Murray did go to see a league championship game in Seattle last week. But he skipped his usual hotel room and drove six hours roundtrip rather than spend the money in the United States.\n \n\n   \n    LA games cheaper for many Jays fans\n \n\n   \n  It was also cheaper for Murray to see a game in LA than in Toronto. The travel expenses were lower, and when he shopped for tickets in Toronto, there was a limited supply selling at two to three times face price.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles has a larger stadium, therefore more tickets, so Murray was able to get an upper deck ticket for face price.\n \n\n   \n  Other Canadian Jays fans at Monday night’s game also found the tickets more affordable than in Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  “We tried to get tickets over there (in Toronto),” said Jat Yassine, who is from Toronto and talked to CNN at the game Monday. “They were sold out very, very fast, and then any of the resale market (tickets) were almost double the price of LA.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from SeatGeek shows average ticket prices of nearly $1,400 in both stadiums as of Monday evening. But those averages were driven up by the most expensive seats. The least expensive seats sold on SeatGeek were closer to $400 in Toronto and $300 in Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  Shimon Sitzer, a Jays fan originally from Toronto who now lives and works in suburban New York, said he met other Jays fans from Canada at the game Monday who had been avoiding US travel but broke down to come to the game.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s actually some people I know would have maybe come if not for the situation with (President Donald) Trump,” he said. “But I met people at the game (from Canada) who said ‘We’re not here to support the United States or its president, we’re here to support our baseball team.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/economy/fed-october-rate-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:31:00-04:00","title":"Fed Rate Cut Possible Amid Government Shutdown Data Blackout","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown is disrupting the flow of critical economic data, including the September jobs report and October CPI, which the Federal Reserve relies on to make monetary policy decisions.

The shutdown could make future cuts more difficult \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:31 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has spent much of the year urging the Federal Reserve to deliver aggressive rate cuts in order to boost the economy. But the government shutdown ironically threatens the very momentum the administration seeks to preserve.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because the shutdown has  suspended the release  of most official economic statistics the Fed relies on to set rates and steer the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Central bankers agreed last month to start cutting rates for the first time since December. That’s because data through August showed a weakening labor market that seems increasingly at risk of falling of a cliff.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed is set to announce a quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting. But if the government data blackout persists for much longer — obscuring how the world’s largest economy is faring — central bankers may revert to the same strategy that frustrated Trump earlier this year; standing pat until there’s better clarity.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed could conclude there’s so much uncertainty because of the lack of government data that it takes it slower with cutting rates than it normally would,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The irony of the shutdown for Trump\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has taken advantage of the shutdown by  defunding Democratic priorities  and  trying to fire thousands of federal workers . But it won’t be able to play the same card with the independent central bank, and the shutdown could backfire on the administration’s own economic goals.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because when the direction of the economy is uncertain, officials lean toward holding rates steady, just as they did throughout most of this year when trying to ascertain the effects of Trump’s sweeping economic policies.\n \n\n   \n  And now, the Fed’s rate-setting committee has reached a point where data is more crucial than ever, since it’s still unclear by how much inflation is going to climb due to Trump’s tariffs and whether layoffs will remain low as companies feel the sting.\n \n\n   \n  The latest inflation data, the Consumer Price Index for September, came out last week despite the shutdown. It was released to ensure the report can be used as a basis for  Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustments.  The report was cooler than economists had predicted, but it still showed that Americans’ cost of living got even more expensive last month, with the annual inflation rate reaching its highest level since January.\n \n\n   \n  But the September jobs report still hasn’t been released because of the shutdown; and the October jobs report, which is due November 7, is also unlikely. The October CPI, which is scheduled for November 13, could also be suspended if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed is “going into a period where you’re trying to figure out: Is this a transition?” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a radio interview earlier this month. “And if you’re not going to get the data, it’s just that much harder.”\n \n\n   \n  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said as much at an economics conference earlier this month, stating that policymaking “could become more challenging.” Investors will be paying attention to how Powell characterizes the lack of government data and what it means for future policy moves at his post-meeting news conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Financial markets are overwhelmingly pricing in a December rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, but “delayed data due to the government shutdown… should also limit Powell’s willingness to commit to a specific policy path beyond October,” David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in a note last week.\n \n\n   \n  Fed officials themselves projected two more quarter-point rate cuts in their latest economic projections from September. They update their projections at every other meeting, so the newest ones are scheduled for December.\n \n\n   \n  Powell said during his October 14 speech “that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,” leaving the door open for additional cuts.\n \n\n   \n  But some Fed officials are growing wary of lowering rates further.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t want to make a mistake, so the way to avoid that is to go cautiously or carefully and do [a quarter-point cut], wait and see what happens, and then you can get a better idea of what to do,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this month.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/portland-federal-agents-admission-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:21:00-04:00","title":"Appeals Court to Reconsider Trump’s Request to Deploy National Guard to Portland After Admission of Factual Error","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to an en banc rehearing to reconsider its earlier decision that blocked President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.

The original decision was made by a three-judge panel, but the en banc panel will have 11 judges. A date for the hearing was not set.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday evening’s decision means the Trump administration will continue to be barred from deploying the National Guard to Portland, four days after a federal judge in Chicago extended an order blocking Guard troops there.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has urged the Supreme Court to let him send in the National Guard to Democratic-led cities in a high-stakes showdown over presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ October 20 decision had frozen a temporary restraining order issued earlier this month by  US District Judge Karin Immergut  that blocked the Trump administration from federalizing and deploying members of Oregon’s National Guard in  Portland . Now, that order will remain in effect as the court reconsiders.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued on September 28 after Trump declared he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city, and Immergut’s  two temporary orders  blocking those efforts closely followed.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, a three-day bench trial   before Immergut is set to begin in Immergut’s court   over whether to impose a permanent injunction barring sending National Guard troops to Oregon.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump ordered a total of 800 guardsmen from Oregon, California and Texas to be on standby for deployment to Portland, the administration’s attorney  said  in Friday’s hearing it doesn’t plan to deploy more than 200.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the Oregon people are ready to deploy … as soon as the court addresses the (restraining order),” Department of Justice attorney Jacob Moshe Roth added.\n \n\n   \n    Trump administration says it overstated number of agents in Portland\n \n\n   \n  The day before the federal appeals court agreed to reconsider the case en banc, the Trump administration made what local leaders fighting a deployment are casting as a remarkable admission:\n \n\n   \n  Part of its testimony justifying the need for troops was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “We deeply regret these errors,” wrote Justice Department attorney Andrew M. Bernie in a Monday  letter  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filed in the court record.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, “115 (Federal Protective Service) officers have had to deploy to Portland” due to monthslong protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility there, an official with that agency – which provides security to government-owned properties – said earlier this month in an  affidavit  in support of a troop deployment.   \n \n\n   \n  “The continued deployment of FPS officers in response to the immigration protests stretches an already thin force beyond what is safe and effective,” Regional Deputy Director Robert Cantu said in the affidavit.   \n \n\n   \n  Those 115 officers amounted to “nearly a quarter of the agency’s entire FPS capacity,” Trump administration attorneys originally said.\n \n\n   \n  However, this “statement was incorrect,” Bernie acknowledged in the Monday letter, noting only about half that number were agents sent out to provide security.\n \n\n   \n  The admission calls into question a key part of the president’s justification for deploying the guard: “FPS, which is the regular security force charged with protecting the (ICE) Building, is stretched to the point of collapse,” the Trump administration argued in its original court  filing .\n \n\n   \n    Dissenting judge had questioned Trump administration details\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority on the appeals panel in the Portland case criticized  Immergut , a Trump appointee, in its decision earlier this month for failing to take the administration’s claims about Portland security needs – specifically, the numbers Cantu cited – at his word.\n \n\n   \n  “Our colleague in dissent and the district court cannot summarily dismiss Director Cantu’s sworn and undisputed statements,” the majority  wrote  in an October 20 filing.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration says many of the 115 agents cited by Cantu were effectively double counted, with some deployed more than once. The actual number of FPS agents sent to Portland was 86, and only 65 were “inspectors” whose primary job is providing security, Bernie’s letter says.\n \n\n   \n  In her dissent, US Appeals Court Judge Susan Graber said she was unimpressed with Cantu’s affidavit, considering it vague.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not know why the government chose not to file a declaration describing the relevant details,” the Clinton appointee wrote in her October 20 dissent. “But it cannot submit an ambiguous assertion and then ask us to interpret that assertion in its favor.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, despite the erroneous filing, even the smaller number of agents shows “the surge of FPS personnel in response to violence and unrest is unsustainable” and Trump has justification to send in the National Guard, Bernie says in the Monday letter.\n \n\n   \n  “Although defendants regret any unintended ambiguity about the number of deployed FPS officers at any given time, there is no basis for concluding that any such ambiguity was the basis for the majority’s decision,” the attorney wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court stay this month did not rely solely on the number of agents. “The statute … does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider” in deciding whether ordinary agents cannot enforce federal law without military help, judges wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Oregon told court Trump administration’s math didn’t add up\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice only discovered the mistake after it was raised by attorneys for plaintiffs Oregon and Portland, Bernie’s Monday letter says.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in their own  letter to the court  noted the numbers in Trump administration filings conflicted with each other, ultimately showing a maximum of 31 FPS officers in the field at any one time.\n \n\n   \n  “This Court must act swiftly to prevent defendants from attempting to benefit from their own material mistake to deploy military forces to peaceful civilian streets, contravening the rule of law and our nation’s history and traditions,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield wrote.\n \n\n   \n  For now, a separate restraining order from Immergut prevents National Guard troops from any state from being deployed in Portland. Following a hearing last week on the federal request to end that restraining order, the judge has not yet made a decision.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/obamacare-premiums-increase-2026-coverage","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:46:00-04:00","title":"Obamacare enrollees get first look at 2026 prices as premiums soar","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Obamacare enrollees are now seeing projected 2026 health insurance prices rise dramatically, with national premiums increasing by 26% and benchmark plans on healthcare.gov rising by 30%.

The premiums on the site reflect the lapse of the enhanced assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Still, most enrollees will be able to find 2026 plans on the federal exchange with premiums at or below $50 a month, after factoring in the original Obamacare subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and not expiring, according to a CMS fact sheet.\n \n\n   \n  But the impact of the expiring enhanced assistance is clear: Nearly 60% of enrollees signing up for 2026 coverage can find plans in that price range, compared to 83% of consumers in 2025 plans.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration frequently touted that four out of five enrollees on the federal exchange could find plans for $10 or less in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The CMS fact sheet, which is the agency’s first release on 2026 open enrollment, did not mention the increase in insurers’ premium rates.\n \n\n   \n    Fight over extending the subsidies\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the beefed-up subsidies is at the  center of the battle on Capitol Hill  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown, which began October 1. Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Renewing the subsidies would cost $350 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n  While the enhanced subsidies, known as premium tax credits, don’t expire until the end of the year, the damage will be done well before that, say Democrats and ACA advocates. Once consumers see much higher premiums, they may not return to sign up for coverage — even if lawmakers renew the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The only time premiums on the federal exchange increased even more was in 2018, after President Donald Trump eliminated federal support for Obamacare subsidies that help people pay for their  out-of-pocket costs . Premiums shot up by 37% that year, reflecting insurers’ uncertainty about the future of the landmark health reform law in the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Paying at least double\n \n\n   \n  Several states that run their own Obamacare exchanges have announced that premiums will at least double next year if the enhanced subsidies lapse.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, premiums will soar to more than $2,780 annually — a jump of more than 174%, on average — because of the enhanced subsidies’ expiration and insurers’ rate hike of 16.6%, according to the state’s Department of Banking and Insurance. About 60,000 enrollees in Get Covered New Jersey will completely lose federal assistance in paying their premiums in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers will soon be shopping and comparing health plans, and without these enhanced tax credits, they will be confronted by startlingly higher prices for coverage,” Commissioner Justin Zimmerman said in a statement. “We are significantly concerned that many households will be forced to choose plans with lesser coverage or choose no coverage at all as a result.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, enrollees in Connect for Health Colorado will see premiums increase an average of 101% next year, the state’s Division of Insurance announced. Roughly 75,000 residents will lose access to health coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Without the enhanced subsidies, a family of four living in the Denver area with an annual income of about $128,000 would no longer qualify for premium assistance and would see their annual premium bill soar by $14,000 for the standard silver plan.\n \n\n   \n  But if the more generous assistance is extended, the average increase for enrollees would be 16%.\n \n\n   \n    Record enrollment\n \n\n   \n  The  enhanced subsidies,  which a Democratic Congress approved in 2021 and extended the following year, have helped drive Obamacare sign-ups to a  record 24 million  for this year.\n \n\n   \n  Around 17 million people signed up for 2025 coverage on healthcare.gov. Another roughly 7 million enrollees live in states that run their own exchanges.\n \n\n   \n  Many Republicans would be affected by the ending of the enhanced subsidies since they live in states that had the highest increases in signups, according to KFF.\n \n\n   \n  The more generous subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers.\n \n\n   \n  But the more generous aid also opened up the exchanges to  fraud , mainly by brokers and agents who sought to earn commissions by enrolling people in Obamacare policies or switching them to new ones without their knowledge or consent.\n \n\n   \n  If the subsidies expire, consumers are expected to flee the exchanges. About 4 million more people would be uninsured in 2034, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis — and that’s on top of the roughly  10 million more people  who will lack coverage due to the One Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/ubs-third-quarter-profits-soar-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:03:00-04:00","title":"Profits soar for UBS in third quarter, exceeding expectations","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UBS reported a 74% increase in net profit to $2.5 billion in Q3 2025, significantly exceeding analyst expectations of $1.29 billion.

The US was notified of the decision to carry out strikes in Gaza, a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Wednesday it will resume the ceasefire but will continue to “respond forcefully to any violation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas denounced what it called the “criminal bombardment” by Israel, which it said violated the ceasefire agreement. It also denied attacking Israeli soldiers and reaffirmed its commitment to the truce.\n \n\n   \n  At least 104 people were killed in the strikes across Gaza overnight Tuesday, according to the Ministry of Health in the battered enclave. These include at least 46 children and 20 women, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  The director of Al-Shifa Hospital described the health and humanitarian situation as “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are no medicines or medical supplies to treat the wounded and the sick.” Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military named the soldier killed as Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, aged 37, from the settlement of Zayit Raanan in the occupied West Bank. A member of the Combat Engineering Corps in the Gaza Division, Feldbaum died durning combat in southern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.\n \n\n   \n  A military official said Hamas had attacked Israeli troops east of the so-called yellow line, which separates Israeli-occupied Gaza from the remainder of the territory. The troops, in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, had come under RPG and sniper fire, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said it was his understanding that “they killed an Israeli soldier,” without naming Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  “So the Israelis hit back,” he told reporters on Air Force One on his way to South Korea, speaking before the reports of dozens of casualties from the Israeli strikes had emerged.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing’s going to jeopardize” the ceasefire, he added, repeating threats that Hamas would be “terminated.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu’s office  said  that Hamas was in “clear violation” of the Gaza ceasefire agreement after returning remains to Israel that did not belong to any of the 13 hostages still unaccounted for in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  An Israeli official told CNN that among the options being considered are expanding the so-called yellow line – Israel’s withdrawal line in Gaza – reoccupying additional territory, or retaking the Netzarim corridor, which cuts across Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Another Israeli source told CNN that any response would be coordinated with the US, adding that Israel was also considering restricting the flow of humanitarian aid, but Washington opposes such a step.\n \n\n   \n    Israel says Hamas staged discovery\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military also released a drone video on Tuesday that it said shows Hamas operatives burying a white cloth containing a body in Gaza City and then staging its discovery in front of the Red Cross.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearly 15-minute clip, three men are seen dragging a white shroud into a bulldozed plot of land near a building and covering the shroud with dirt. After the shroud is completely covered, a bulldozer scoops up the dirt and drops it into a nearby pile. Moments later, Red Cross officials arrive on the scene as the shroud containing the body is pulled from the dirt. With the Red Cross standing nearby, the video shows the white cloth being buried and uncovered once again as someone with a cell phone appears to take a video of the scene.\n \n\n   \n  The military said the video showed that Hamas “is attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies” of the remaining deceased hostages. CNN cannot independently verify the video or the identities of the individuals in it.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Cross said that its team was “not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones,” the Red Cross said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The organization said that it had agreed to operate as an intermediary “in good faith” and noted that the situation in Gaza is “exceedingly challenging to work in.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment on the video.\n \n\n   \n    Hamas postpones hostage handover\n \n\n   \n  Soon after Netanyahu said Israel would carry out new strikes in Gaza, the armed wing of Hamas announced it would postpone the handover of a hostage’s body that was recovered in southern Gaza on Tuesday due to Israel’s “violations.”\n \n\n   \n  The militant group also warned that any Israeli escalation would “hinder search and excavation operations and the retrieval of bodies” of the deceased Israeli hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas had been set to transfer remains of a deceased hostage to Israel via the Red Cross on Tuesday. The group said the body had been pulled from a tunnel in Khan Younis.\n \n\n   \n  A second body was unearthed in Nuseirat in central Gaza from the rubble of a building where Israel had carried out a rescue operation in June 2024. The operation rescued three Israeli hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas said at the time that other hostages had been killed during the Israeli operation, which both Israel and the US denied. But CNN has geolocated footage from the recovery of the body that shows it is the same building where the rescue occurred, raising fresh questions about whether Israeli hostages were killed during the mission.

first-degree murder trial  of a sheriff’s deputy who shot Sonya Massey, a Black woman who had called 911 for help and was later killed in her home because of the way she was handling a pan of hot water.\n \n\n   \n  The nine-woman, three-man jury received the case Tuesday and deliberated for about 6 1/2 hours. Jurors must decide whether Sean Grayson, 31, is guilty of murder for fatally shooting Massey in Springfield.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and another deputy answered Massey’s emergency call reporting a prowler outside the 36-year-old woman’s home early on the morning of July 6, 2024. They entered the house and, spotting a pan of hot water on the stove, Grayson ordered it removed, according to the other deputy’s body camera video, which was key evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and Massey joked about how Grayson moved away as Massey moved the hot pan. Then, Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” Grayson yelled at her to drop the pot and threatened to shoot her. Massey apologized and ducked behind a counter.\n \n\n   \n  “She makes it abundantly clear, ‘I want no part of this. Let this be done,’” Sangamon County First Assistant State’s Attorney Mary Beth Rodgers said in her closing argument.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Daniel Fultz beseeched the jury to decide how Grayson felt in the moment, “not to sit back 15 months later and say, ‘This is what I would have done.’”\n \n\n   \n  “It is true that she put the pot down. If it ended there, we wouldn’t be here today, but for reasons we’ll never know, she reacquired the pot, stood up and threw it in his direction,” Fultz said. “Only at that time did he fire his weapon.”\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes. The accompanying publicity, protests and legal action over the incident prompted the judge to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, to Peoria, an hour’s drive north of the capital city.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of first-degree murder, Grayson faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison. The jury also has been given the option of considering second-degree murder, which applies when there is a “serious provocation” of the defendant or when defendants believe their actions are justified even though that belief is unreasonable.\n \n\n   \n  Second-degree murder is punishable by a term of four to 20 years or probation.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/sport/football-nfl-week-8-takeaways-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:39:00-04:00","title":"NFL Week 8 Takeaways: Trade Speculation, Late Charge in Baltimore, and QB Uncertainty in Minnesota","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 8 of the 2025 NFL season featured a mix of surprising results and critical team struggles.

Start of late charge in Baltimore? QB uncertainty in Minnesota? NFL Week 8 takeaways \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:39 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The theme of the 2025  NFL  season’s Week 8 was gnarly blowouts from pre-game favorites, with a sprinkling of shock results.\n \n\n   \n  There wasn’t a more surprising result than the New York Jets  getting their first win  of the season in a high-scoring affair against the Cincinnati Bengals, while the under-fire head coach of the Miami Dolphins, Mike McDaniel, also got a much-needed win on the road against the Atlanta Falcons.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the three main takeaways from  Week 8  of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Big names to be traded before deadline?\n \n\n   \n  All 32 teams have until November 4 to agree to trades to improve right now or acquire assets to bolster their future.\n \n\n   \n  One team that could be shipping off some of its star players is the New York Jets, who have reportedly been receiving calls for defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and running back Breece Hall.\n \n\n   \n  According to  NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport , it would take a “huge offer” for Williams to move from New York, but teams have enquired about the possibility of trading for the three-time Pro Bowler.\n \n\n   \n  Hall, who scored three touchdowns as the Jets got their first win of the season on Sunday, is more unlikely to be moved but has still received interest, per Rapoport.\n \n\n   \n  The 1-7 Tennessee Titans are also likely to be sellers ahead of the deadline, with the franchise  reportedly open  to trading away anyone aside from 2025 No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward and star DT Jeffery Simmons.\n \n\n   \n  One of the Super Bowl contending teams who could be active at the deadline is the  Buffalo Bills .\n \n\n   \n  The team’s run defense has been porous to start the season and could get worse following the torn bicep suffered by defensive tackle Ed Oliver; Bills head coach Sean McDermott  confirmed  Oliver would undergo surgery and will be out indefinitely.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo might look for help in the middle of their defensive line with Oliver absent, with Williams making a lot of sense to fill that gap.\n \n\n   \n  Whether it be Super Bowl-aspiring teams looking for that final piece to get them over the top or another trying to unload big contracts in return for draft picks, there could be plenty of action over the next week.\n \n\n   \n    Start of a late charge in Baltimore?\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a season to forget in Baltimore for many reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Injuries have plagued the roster at numerous key positions, including star quarterback Lamar Jackson, who has missed the last four weeks, and two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike, who suffered a season-ending neck injury in Week 2.\n \n\n   \n  And with the roster down to its bare bones, the Ravens have struggled, falling to 2-5 and their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.\n \n\n   \n  But in Week 8 – coming off a bye – they got back to winning ways.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore’s game against the Chicago Bears saw the return of full-back Patrick Ricard on offense – a key component in their usually-proficient running game – as well as star linebacker Roquan Smith and starting cornerback Chidobe Awuzie all taking to the field.\n \n\n   \n  With a more complete team, the Ravens looked much more like their usual selves, romping to a 30-16 victory in which every facet of the team shone.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens were still without Jackson on Sunday, despite some confusion around his availability as he looks to return from a lingering hamstring injury.\n \n\n   \n  The two-time NFL MVP was listed as a full participant in Friday’s practice before being ruled out of Sunday’s game; his practice participation grade was later changed to limited.\n \n\n   \n  After Sunday’s victory, head coach John Harbaugh said he was “hopeful” that his star QB would return for Baltimore’s Week 9 game against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “As a coach, you ask: ‘How is he doing?’ That’s about as much as you do,” Harbaugh told reporters. “‘How are we doing it? What do you think?’ … The coaches aren’t involved in statuses and whether guys play or not. That’s not a coaching decision.”\n \n\n   \n  In Jackson’s absence, Tyler Huntley played one of his best career games, throwing 17-of-22 for 186 yards and a touchdown while orchestrating the offense with proficiency.\n \n\n   \n  The win improves the Ravens to third in an AFC North where no team is running away with it – the Pittsburgh Steelers lead with a 4-3 record and Baltimore still has to play them twice – and a late season surge could be on the cards.\n \n\n   \n    QB uncertainty in Minnesota?\n \n\n   \n  Having been drafted in the first round of last year’s draft and missing the entirety of last season, there was plenty of excitement about JJ McCarthy’s first foray into NFL action.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s been a slow start for the former Michigan quarterback, enduring two rocky games before missing the next five with an ankle injury.\n \n\n   \n  In his absence, Carson Wentz has filled in, but the 32-year-old was placed on injured reserve on Monday after undergoing season-ending surgery on a shoulder injury.\n \n\n   \n  It opens the door for McCarthy to return to the lineup finally; head coach Kevin O’Connell told reporters last week that if their Week 8 game had been on Sunday not Thursday, McCarthy might’ve been ready to play.\n \n\n   \n  With a star-studded roster and aspirations of making a deep playoff run in Minnesota, the 22-year-old will be under pressure immediately to show drastic improvements from his showing earlier this campaign.\n \n\n   \n  His Week 1 debut against the Chicago Bears was wrought with errors for three quarters before a magical turnaround in the final 15 minutes salvaged a win for the Vikings. In Week 2, McCarthy played poorly, throwing two interceptions and fumbling three times.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy will return to a Vikings team whose offensive line is dealing with injuries, not an ideal situation for a young quarterback – left tackle Christian Darrisaw, right tackle Brian O’Neill and center Ryan Kelly are all banged up.\n \n\n   \n  But following  Minnesota’s Week 8 blowout loss  to the Los Angeles Chargers on Thursday Night Football, O’Connell said it’ll take a team-wide effort to get the season back on track.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to try to find a way to find our rhythm, find our identity as a group,” he said. “And with JJ, he’ll play an integral part of that from a standpoint of his ability to throw completions, his ability to get our playmakers involved and his ability to use his athleticism that we saw early on in the season. … But it’s got to be an all-11 thing.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to protect him. We’ve got to find a way to provide the quarterback with time to find those open players.”\n \n\n   \n    Full Week 8 scores\n \n\n   \n   Home vs. away (winners in bold) \n \n\n   \n   Thursday \n \n\n   \n   Los Angeles Chargers  37-10 Minnesota Vikings\n \n\n   \n   Sunday \n \n\n   \n  Atlanta Falcons 10-34  Miami Dolphins \n \n\n   \n   Baltimore Ravens  30-16 Chicago Bears\n \n\n   \n  Carolina Panthers 9-40  Buffalo Bills \n \n\n   \n  Cincinnati Bengals 38-39  New York Jets \n \n\n   \n   Houston Texans  26-15 San Francisco 49ers\n \n\n   \n   New England Patriots  32-13 Cleveland Browns\n \n\n   \n   Philadelphia Eagles  38-20 New York Giants\n \n\n   \n  New Orleans Saints 3-23  Tampa Bay Buccaneers \n \n\n   \n   Denver Broncos  44-24 Dallas Cowboys\n \n\n   \n   Indianapolis Colts  38-14 Tennessee Titans\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers 25-35  Green Bay Packers \n \n\n   \n   Monday \n \n\n   \n   Kansas City Chiefs  28-7 Washington Commanders\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/adidas-us-sales-drop-tariffs-yeezys-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:54:00-04:00","title":"Adidas Sales in North America Drop Over Tariffs and End of Yeezys","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Adidas reported a 5% drop in North American sales in Q3 2025, primarily due to the end of the Yeezy line in 2024 and a volatile global environment intensified by US tariffs.

An investigation into FEMA didn’t fit Trump’s narrative. His DHS ordered a new probe that did \n       \n  By Gabe Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the final month of the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump put his critique of FEMA’s response to Hurricane Helene front and center, making  false claims  that funding was stolen for illegal migrants and the agency ignored requests for help.\n \n\n   \n  One particular claim had legs – that Republican residents were not getting the aid they needed because of their political affiliation.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation that began under then-President Joe Biden and carried over into the Trump administration ultimately cleared the Federal Emergency Management Agency, finding no evidence of a systemic effort to deny aid based on politics while singling out one supervisor’s actions as illegal and improper.\n \n\n   \n  But at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, leadership including Secretary Kristi Noem weren’t satisfied, three former senior FEMA officials told CNN. Within weeks, leaders ordered a new investigation that came to a much different conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Noem announced last week that the DHS probe found “for years, FEMA employees under the Biden Administration intentionally delayed much-needed aid to Americans suffering from natural disasters on purely political grounds.” She called it “textbook political discrimination” against Trump supporters.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation looked at whether FEMA workers who went door-to-door in disaster zones recorded any protected private information about survivors’ political views. It found roughly 100 field reports — a small fraction out of tens of thousands of cases during the Biden administration — where FEMA workers visiting homes mentioned campaign signs or made notes related to “political beliefs.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators flagged a few instances where canvasser notes mentioned “Trump” or “Biden,” but in most cases, workers were documenting gun signage, which also was categorized as political. The report does not show that disaster survivors were denied aid because of these notations, and sources say the gun notations were often made for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Noem portrayed the findings as proof of FEMA’s “widespread” and “systematic” bias and said she would  refer the issue to the Justice Department for potential prosecution  —  her latest public attack on an agency she argues needs sweeping reforms or even abolition. Behind the scenes, insiders accuse DHS and Noem of stoking rumors and misinformation to help justify tearing FEMA down, as some argue it’s the Trump administration using disaster aid as a political weapon.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been looking to prove that narrative any way they can, and to me, this is just a fabricated way of advancing it when really it’s not factually there,” said one of several FEMA officials who asked not to be named for fear of retribution.\n \n\n   \n  “If we do something wrong, okay, hold us accountable,” the official added. “But don’t fabricate it because it meets your political narrative. That’s just bad government.”\n \n\n   \n    Two hurricanes and a political firestorm\n \n\n   \n  The political firestorm began last September after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Then-candidate  Trump accused FEMA  and the Biden administration of ignoring Republican areas and spending all its disaster aid on undocumented immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  FEMA workers soon faced threats and hostility in disaster zones, and some teams were  pulled from areas for safety . Weeks later, Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coast. FEMA teams, now stretched thin up and down the coast, reported widespread harassment fueled by Trump’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, FEMA field supervisor Marn’i Washington delivered a now  infamous directive  to her 11 staffers deployed in Florida: “Avoid homes advertising Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington told CNN at the time that her supervisors had issued the orders, citing concerns about abuse from Trump supporters. However, the investigation later determined that no such directive was given; it was Washington’s own interpretation of how to protect her team.\n \n\n   \n  FEMA leadership working under the Biden administration fired Washington and denounced her actions, deploying staff to the homes that may have been skipped. Then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell was called before Congress, where she condemned the directive as illegal and unacceptable, and said she’d already referred the case for further investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “I stand by the testimony I provided to Congress under oath. When the initial incident came to light, I immediately took decisive action and addressed the situation,” Criswell told CNN in a statement last week. “I remain confident that we responded appropriately to the information we had.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Florida’s attorney general  filed a lawsuit  alleging civil rights violations against FEMA and Criswell. To some, Washington’s actions were proof that Trump was right: FEMA is biased against Republicans.\n \n\n   \n    An investigation clears FEMA\n \n\n   \n  Over the next four months, FEMA’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel investigated the incident and broader agency culture – a probe that carried into Trump’s term.\n \n\n   \n  Days after his inauguration, Trump visited western North Carolina and floated the idea of eliminating FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  In March, Trump’s acting FEMA administrator, Cameron Hamilton,  told lawmakers  that three additional staffers had been fired in connection with the Washington incident, primarily for poor supervision or misleading investigators, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Hamilton’s letter to Congress said investigators found “no evidence that this was a systemic problem, nor that it was directed by agency or field leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, they found the opposite: that politics rarely came up in disaster zones.\n \n\n   \n  “Tens of thousands of records were screened and reviewed. We found there was no reasonable evidence to authenticate a statement that denial of aid or assistance occurred based upon political bias from FEMA leadership,” Hamilton told CNN this week. “These isolated incidents were awful and a breach of public trust, however I did not see evidence that they were systemic across the agency. I say this as a lifelong Republican and supporter of President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The probe formally  cleared Criswell and FEMA  in April, and Florida settled its lawsuit with no damages paid.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, agency leaders believed the case was closed and perhaps the findings would ease the anti-FEMA rhetoric from Trump and Noem. They were wrong.\n \n\n   \n    A second look at FEMA wrongdoing\n \n\n   \n  Roman Jankowski, the newly appointed head of DHS’s Privacy Office and an alum of the Heritage Foundation, launched a separate review weeks after the internal probe concluded and requested the data investigators had relied on, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Jankowski took a different approach, focusing on whether FEMA aid workers violated privacy laws by recording protected information — such as political beliefs — and whether that information could have been used to withhold disaster aid for political reasons. His review went beyond the initial investigation, which focused solely on the 2024 hurricane season, and examined data from the entirety of Biden’s four years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “He definitely made it clear that he suspected FEMA was involved in broad-scale wrongdoing,” said a senior FEMA official who spoke directly to Jankowski about the review. “You could tell he had already arrived at a conclusion that FEMA as an agency needed to be severely punished, which was evident in his tone and language.”\n \n\n   \n  Jankowski’s team released its report last week.\n \n\n   \n  The  22-page report  concludes FEMA canvassers going door-to-door repeatedly violated – or may have violated – privacy laws by collecting information on survivors’ political beliefs, and in a handful of cases, bypassed certain homes based on the details they noted.\n \n\n   \n  But more than a dozen current and former FEMA officials argue that the evidence does not support claims of a systemic problem. They point out canvassers referenced Trump just 15 times in their reports, and it remains unclear whether workers never returned to those homes.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a statistician, but when you’re looking at four years of data across tens of thousands of damaged homes, it doesn’t seem significant,” former FEMA chief of staff Michael Coen, who served under the Biden and Obama administrations, told CNN. “It doesn’t demonstrate that people were discriminated against in a systematic way.”\n \n\n   \n  FEMA officials say these freeform notes are primarily used to alert colleagues about field conditions, especially for safety, and were not surprised that most of the so-called “partisan” notes referenced gun signage.\n \n\n   \n  After Hurricane Helene, those safety worries reached a fever pitch. Trump’s relentless attacks on FEMA had sparked a wave of threats against the teams trying to help survivors in North Carolina, leaving workers on edge.\n \n\n   \n  “We were hearing that guys in trucks with guns were out looking for FEMA employees, and the teams were freaked out,” a former senior official deployed to North Carolina said. “Let’s have common sense. FEMA employees are not law enforcement officers. They’re not walking around with bulletproof vests. This idea that they’re just going to run into harm’s way to register somebody is ridiculous.”\n \n\n   \n  The report points to a few specific entries from canvassers who allegedly skipped homes, such as: “Survivor very anti govt anti Biden. Told me to tell Biden to go [f***] himself” and “…a lot of explicit political flags, posters, etc. ‘F*** Joe Biden’ ‘MAGA 2024’ ‘Joe Biden Sucks’ ‘Trump 2024.’ We do not recommend anyone visiting this location.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS raised concerns that such notes likely led FEMA teams not to return to the homes.\n \n\n   \n  But Noem has been more definitive in her claims about what the investigation found, saying the probe found “FEMA employees systematically refused to visit the houses of disaster survivors that displayed signs and flags they disagreed with, including those with campaign signs supporting President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s FEMA  ended door-to-door canvassing  earlier this year, largely because of safety concerns and the fact that most survivors now apply for FEMA assistance online or through call centers, not through canvassers.\n \n\n   \n  Several current and former senior FEMA officials acknowledged that some canvassers may have violated privacy laws and agreed that reviewing those cases would be appropriate. However, they cautioned that using this as evidence of an agencywide systemic effort to deny aid based on politics is unfounded.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether or not there was bias in note taking, that’s a highly subjective analysis, but we didn’t find it to be sufficient to conclude wide-spread impact,” Hamilton said this week of the first internal investigation.\n \n\n   \n    The next phase of Trump’s war on FEMA\n \n\n   \n  As Noem paints the agency as partisan and inept, the new FEMA Review Council is set to present recommendations for reforms in the coming weeks. Trump has vowed to start phasing out FEMA after hurricane season, though he hasn’t detailed what that will entail.\n \n\n   \n  From the outset, Noem positioned herself as Trump’s point person to fulfill his promise to dismantle FEMA. She now says the goal is to eliminate FEMA “as it exists today,” and she’s made clear that “cleaning house” and asserting control are central to that process.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s trying to drive this narrative of how woke, terrible and unaccountable FEMA is, which is why they need to abolish it,” one former top official said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, current and former FEMA officials say her attacks continue to erode public trust in the agency responsible for helping disaster survivors in their most vulnerable moments.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s dangerous,” said Coen, the former FEMA chief of staff. “The faith in FEMA has declined. When people lose their trust in the federal government in a time of need, they’re going to feel more helpless.”\n \n\n   \n  Some FEMA officials note the irony of these accusations, as Trump himself faces criticism for politicizing disaster aid —  repeatedly   posting  on  Truth   Social  about sending millions to states that supported him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week,  Trump announced  $2.5 million for Missouri after speaking with its Republican governor, despite FEMA recommending denial because the damage was below the agency’s threshold for federal aid to be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “That request was dead and buried in our minds,” a senior FEMA official involved in the process told CNN. “Our damage assessments didn’t seem to indicate the recovery was beyond the State’s capacity. And believe me, we’re generally eager to help our state partners when it’s warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration had previously  fast-tracked FEMA money to Missouri  while emergency funds for other states remained frozen.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, Democratic-led states like Maryland and Washington have been denied disaster aid by the president, even when their damage far exceeded FEMA’s threshold and approval was recommended.\n \n\n   \n  Noem has ramped up her rhetoric in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, she issued a press release announcing the firing of a FEMA staffer and an agency contractor for viewing sexually explicit content on government devices.\n \n\n   \n  “We are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Since pledging to dismantle FEMA at the start of the administration, DHS leaders have subjected staff to polygraph tests, publicly fired employees, and placed dozens on administrative leave without warning or explanation. More than a quarter of FEMA’s full-time workforce has left through layoffs and buyouts, including dozens of senior leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, DHS has consolidated power at FEMA, filling leadership roles with political appointees and pushing out career experts who helped shape disaster response and recovery.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/australia/australia-cruise-passenger-lizard-island-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:42:00-04:00","title":"Elderly woman found dead on tropical island after cruise ship leaves without her","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An elderly woman in her 80s was found dead on Lizard Island, a tropical resort island off Queensland, after a cruise ship, the Coral Adventurer, departed without her.

on tropical island after cruise ship leaves without her \n       \n  By Hilary Whiteman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:42 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A cruise passenger in her 80s, who had just embarked on a 60-day luxury tour around Australia, was found dead after being left behind on a tropical island.\n \n\n   \n  The passenger, who hasn’t been named, was reported missing to authorities on Saturday night, when a check of small cruise ship the Coral Adventurer confirmed she wasn’t on board.\n \n\n   \n  The vessel had docked earlier Saturday at Lizard Island, a resort island about 30 kilometers (19 miles) off the Queensland coast known for its natural beauty and luxury accommodation.\n \n\n   \n  Queensland Police confirmed the woman’s body was found on Lizard Island on Sunday, and described her death as “sudden and non-suspicious.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear when she died, nor why no one noticed she wasn’t on board the boat when it departed Lizard Island.\n \n\n   \n  The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said its investigation will include “the circumstances surrounding why the passenger may not have been accounted for during boarding.”\n \n\n   \n  Records show the Coral Adventurer, with capacity for 120 passengers and 46 crew, had left the port of Cairns just a day earlier on October 24.\n \n\n   \n  Lizard Island was one of the first stops on the 80,000-Australian-dollar ($50,000) cruise taking passengers around the country, via its northern tip of Cape York, towards the coast of Western Australia.\n \n\n   \n  Cruise operator Coral Expeditions advertises Lizard Island as a place passengers can swim, snorkel or take a hike to “Cook’s Look” for panoramic views.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the elderly woman took part in any advertised activities while on the island.\n \n\n   \n  The company has been operating for more than 40 years and offers cruises around Australia and beyond. Coral Expeditions CEO Mark Fifield said in a statement that a “land and sea” search commenced after the crew discovered the woman was missing.\n \n\n   \n  AMSA said it began searching with Queensland Police after the ship’s captain reported the woman missing to authorities at 9 p.m. on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Queensland Police said the woman was reported missing “after failing to board a vessel in waters off Queensland earlier on Saturday.”\n \n\n   \n  AMSA says the crew will be questioned when the ship docks in Darwin. The port schedule shows it is expected to arrive on November 2.\n \n\n   \n  Fifield, from Coral Expeditions, said the company is “deeply sorry that this has occurred.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Coral team have been in contact with the woman’s family, and we will continue to offer support to them through this difficult process.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/style/bruce-springsteen-movie-costume-design","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:22:00-04:00","title":"Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

Dressing Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen \n       \n  By Nicole Mowbray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:22 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It is fall 1981 and a 31-year-old Bruce Springsteen has just wrapped a wildly successful tour for his latest album, “The River.” But instead of returning to the studio to produce new songs — as was the preference of his label Columbia Records — the musician retreated to a quiet house in Colts Neck, New Jersey, near where he grew up, to rest and recover.\n \n\n   \n  There, intentionally isolated, but unintentionally reliving childhood trauma and subsequent depression, Springsteen ended up self-recording 10 songs that would form his seminal low-fi album “Nebraska.”\n \n\n   \n  This definitive period in the rock star’s life is the background to “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” a new movie directed by filmmaker Scott Cooper, which stars “The Bear’s” Jeremy Allen White as a convincing Springsteen and Jeremy Strong, of “Succession” fame, portraying his longtime manager and friend Jon Landau.\n \n\n   \n  The stylish biopic charts the tumultuous times of Springsteen’s early life and their influence on his music. It doesn’t, however, shy away from examining the singer’s often painful oscillation between indefatigable global rock god and fragile human, and his search for authenticity and belonging when separated from his working class roots.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a dichotomy also conveyed through Springsteen’s clothing — his eminently familiar blue collar ‘Americana’ uniform of Levi’s jeans, leather jackets with the collar popped, plaid flannels, white tanks and boots, which the now 76-year-old can still be seen in today.\n \n\n   \n  In a video interview with CNN, the movie’s costume director Kasia Walicka Maimone (whose CV includes “The Gilded Age,” “Moonrise Kingdom,” and “Capote”) said that she and her team did a lot of prep before their first meeting with Springsteen, who was involved in the production.\n \n\n   \n  “Bruce was pretty involved and it was amazing to spend time with him because, of course, he’s a legend. Many of us on the movie were already big fans,” she said. “The way he can communicate emotion and tell stories that resonate is, to me, like religion. But there was definitely a moment to put the awe aside and say, ‘OK, now we have to become collaborators’.”\n \n\n   \n  But, said Maimone, Springsteen eminently respected the creative process. “What became clear even in the first conversation I had with Bruce was that, even though he was very well photographed at that specific time (1981-1982), there were pieces he loved more than others — his everyday wear was different to items that were used for photoshoots or concerts. We were continuously breaking through the levels of intimacy and discovering those super private moments and pieces that were significant, that meant a lot to him… Those are what we tried to reflect in the movie, so Bruce’s input was key.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some of the garments White wears in the film are borrowed from Springsteen’s actual wardrobe, including a Triumph Motorcycles T-shirt and an original blue and white plaid shirt from the early 1980s that the star had often worn. “That was one of Bruce’s beloved pieces, and it was very delicate,” Maimone said. “We knew that it might shred during filming, not least because Jeremy Allen White and Bruce Springsteen are not the same size. But we all wanted so much to use it in an emotional scene with Bruce and his father, and Bruce felt that if the piece were to shred, that particular scene would be the most beautiful moment for it to go.”\n \n\n   \n    The personal is political\n \n\n   \n  Very few rock stars’ wardrobes stand the test of time. Even fewer keep that up over a 50-year career. Yet 45 years on from “Nebraska,” the one they call “The Boss” remains one of the world’s greatest music icons with an almost unchanged personal style, having sold more than 140 million records, winning 20 Grammy awards and earning a billion-dollar fortune along the way.\n \n\n   \n  Part of Springsteen’s visual legend comes from the fact that everything he wears — the denim, the leather jackets, the flannel shirts — is easily accessible to his fans. “Around that time (the early 1980s), Bruce Springsteen was universally appealing. Men wanted to be him and women wanted to date him,” said Patricia Mears, deputy director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, in a phone call. “He’s not consciously stylish, but he is authentically working class, which is where the bulk of his audience is from too. His clothing choices embody the image of a man who does ‘a proper day’s work,’ which is an idea that would appeal to his fanbase.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s a look also tied up in personal politics and patriotism — take, for instance, the worn Levis, faded baseball cap and overall red, white and blue theme on the cover of 1984’s “Born In The USA” album. Springsteen has also stayed true to his left-leaning roots despite global fame. “He supports workers, never comes across as being elitist and threads a very narrow channel of managing to still appeal to his working class base — many of whom have probably supported Donald Trump — without doing the same,” added Mears.\n \n\n   \n  Nancy Deihl, a fashion historian and chair of New York University’s art department, who grew up in New Jersey, said Springsteen and his style was known to her and her friends before he was known to the rest of the world. “I recall a multi-generational conversation held over a holiday dinner,” Deihl explained in a phone call. “The parents all said Bruce Springsteen’s clothes made him look so grubby. They were used to polished performers like Frank Sinatra or Tom Jones. They read his working class style — the bandanas, the jeans — as alternative, as his ‘having not tried hard enough’.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Deihl sees Springsteen’s workwear style as “a signifier of socio-economics; basic, usable items in fabrics such as denim and flannel,” she explained. “These associations not only echo the messaging of his music, they don’t date.”\n \n\n   \n    How he wears what he wears\n \n\n   \n  Springsteen was also a harbinger of the rise of workwear within fashion more broadly, said Mears. “Today, workwear is commonly repurposed as fashion — think Carhartt and Dickies — and performative hipsters channel that authenticity with, sometimes, limited success. But the way Springsteen did it is not hackneyed. His connection to American roots and American roots music authenticated him to dress in this way.”\n \n\n   \n  To create a believable image in the film, it was important for Maimone to channel how Springsteen wears clothes as much as source the correct garments themselves. “Bruce has fantastic style naturally, but he also gives clothes charisma,” she said. “He wore utilitarian workwear pieces in a very specific way — the super tight, high-waisted jeans, Cuban-heeled boots, leather jackets that fit exactly… Bruce’s proportions are perfectly balanced and he wears pieces with a level of ease and confidence. The same item on somebody else might look very different. My job was to capture that ease and confidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Maimone said she and the costuming team spent a long time with White when he was “absorbing” Springsteen, referencing old photographs, period vintage pieces they’d spent months sourcing and the insights from Springsteen himself.\n \n\n   \n  “Jeremy was becoming, you know, the channeler of Bruce Springsteen’s spirit,” said Maimone. “He did it so beautifully and he became him in the most phenomenal way. And it translated to the way he wore those pieces. We sometimes liken a movie’s clothing to another ‘skin,’ another level of the character. And Jeremy ‘absorbed’ the skin of Bruce Springsteen.”\n \n\n   \n  The man himself agrees. “Jeremy didn’t try to do any sort of impression. He simply inhabited my inner life,” said Springsteen in the movie’s notes. “The camera picked up on those complexities and that was essential in making the character completely believable. That’s where he’s performing his magic from, and he just did a beautiful job of it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/africa/sudan-rsf-takes-el-fasher-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:21:00-04:00","title":"Bloodbath feared as rebels trap thousands in Sudan city","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Sudanese rebels—primarily the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)—have captured El Fasher, the last major stronghold of the Sudanese government in Darfur, marking a critical turning point in the ongoing civil war.

How did we get here and what might come next? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:21 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sudanese rebels have driven government forces from El Fasher, the last stronghold of the country’s regime in the western Darfur region, amid a brutal struggle for territory that has led to alleged genocide and contributed to one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has besieged El Fasher, its final major barrier to controlling Darfur. The RSF aims to establish a parallel government in the region. It has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for power since April 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Estimates suggest that  more than 150,000 people have died  due to the conflict, while an additional 14 million have been displaced from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also the de facto head of state, acknowledged the rebels’ capture of El Fasher. In a  broadcast  on Monday, he stated that his troops retreated from the city due to the destruction and systematic killing of civilians.\n \n\n   \n  Justin Lynch, a Sudan researcher and managing director of Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and conflict monitoring organization, told CNN that the RSF’s capture of El Fasher marks “the beginning of what we fear to be a massacre of civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations humanitarian chief, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in El Fasher, lacking food and health care. He  reported  that escape routes have been blocked amid “intense shelling and ground assaults” that “have engulfed the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has  claimed it is committed  to protecting civilians in El Fasher and providing safe corridors for those seeking to leave.\n \n\n   \n  However, the  UN Human Rights Office said  it had received “multiple, alarming reports” of the RSF committing atrocities including summary executions of civilians, and videos showing dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead surrounded by RSF fighters.\n \n\n   \n  It also cited “indications of ethnic motivations for killings.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Jalale Getachew Birru, a senior analyst at the crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there is a “high risk of ethnically targeted attacks, particularly against non-Arab groups.”\n \n\n   \n  Between April 2023 and mid-October 2025, her organization documented 390 incidents of violence against civilians in El Fasher and surrounding areas, resulting in over 1,300 reported fatalities, along with 180 attacks on internally displaced persons (IDPs) that caused at least 830 deaths.\n \n\n   \n  Ethnically motivated killings have been a feature of the conflict from its outset, particularly in Darfur. The region experienced some of its worst ethnic violence in 2023, with hundreds of individuals from non-Arab ethnic groups  massacred  by the RSF and forces linked to it.\n \n\n   \n    How did we get here?\n \n\n   \n  For the past 30 months, army leader al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads the RSF, have been fighting over control of Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  These two men, once allies and among the most powerful generals in the country, jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from power in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  They also played significant roles in a  subsequent coup in 2021  when al-Burhan seized control from Sudan’s transitional government.\n \n\n   \n  Both generals have faced Western sanctions due to their involvement in war crimes. However, Dagalo’s RSF, along with its allied Arab militias, has been  accused by the United States of committing genocide  during the ongoing civil war. This marks the second time in two decades that the US has declared genocide in Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  The US government said when making the declaration in January that the RSF had executed “direct attacks against civilians,” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, it said, they had “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” and “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Sudan’s military government has  accused the United Arab Emirates  of supplying weapons to the RSF, although the UAE has denied this.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the RSF?\n \n\n   \n  The RSF is a paramilitary group with an  estimated 100,000 fighters , approximately  half the size of the SAF .\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has a history tied to ethnically-driven violence.\n \n\n   \n  The group emerged from the Arab Janjaweed militia, which was responsible for the genocide in Darfur during the early 2000s. That resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths.\n \n\n   \n  The recent killings in El Fasher and other areas of Darfur reflect a pattern of targeted violence similar to that seen during the earlier genocide.\n \n\n   \n  According to Lynch, the RSF’s takeover of El Fasher will “only mean more misery for civilians.”\n \n\n   \n    Why is El Fasher’s capture significant, and what might happen next?\n \n\n   \n  The RSF’s seizure of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, represents a significant turning point that allows the group to strengthen its hold on the broader Darfur region, according to Birru.\n \n\n   \n  It comes in the wake of the SAF  regaining control of the country’s capital , Khartoum, from the RSF earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Fighting is now expected to shift to the central and oil-rich Kordofan region, which borders Darfur, according to Birru.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF  announced  on Saturday it had taken Bara, a crucial transport hub in North Kordofan state that connects the strategic town to the rest of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “In Kordofan, the SAF and its allies are seeking to secure key routes connecting central Sudan to the Darfur region, while the RSF is working to consolidate control across both regions to rein in its alternative government in western Sudan,” Birru said.\n \n\n   \n  “The outcome of battles in El Fasher and Kordofan will likely determine the future trajectory of Sudan’s conflict and the country’s political future,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  According to Lynch, the capture of El Fasher – and, by extension, all of Darfur – positions the RSF in a stronger negotiating stance amid a global push for a ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  International human rights lawyer Yonah Diamond told CNN that the international community must intervene as violence escalates in Sudan and civilian casualties increase in El Fasher, asking whether world leaders would allow the RSF “to commit another genocide in Darfur with impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  “The time for emergency action is right now – to end the bloodshed, open humanitarian corridors, and protect the people of El Fasher and what’s left of any global conscience,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/maduro-cyberattack-trump-cia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"U.S. Escalates Military and Covert Pressure on Venezuela Amid Trump’s Second-Term Push for Regime Change","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final year of Donald Trump’s first term, the CIA carried out a successful cyberattack targeting Venezuela’s intelligence network, aimed at satisfying Trump’s demand for action against Nicolás Maduro without escalating military conflict.

Now the US is flexing its military might \n       \n  By Katie Bo Lillis, Sean Lyngaas, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the final year of President Donald Trump’s first administration, the CIA carried out a clandestine cyberattack against the Venezuelan government, disabling the computer network used by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s intelligence service.\n \n\n   \n  The attack, described to CNN by four sources familiar with the operation, was perfectly successful.\n \n\n   \n  It was also a throwaway, those sources said — an effort by the CIA to satisfy the president’s ambitions to do something about Venezuela and avoid taking riskier, more direct action against Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  The previously unreported episode was one of a series of moves that national security officials took to placate Trump during his first term in office as he sought to oust Maduro, covert maneuvering that came to deeply frustrate the president and his team as the Venezuelan strong man remained stubbornly in power.\n \n\n   \n  It helps underscore the president’s public determination to take a maximalist approach toward Venezuela in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Since the summer, the US has amassed a huge military force in the region, including roughly 10,000 troops, with an aircraft carrier now en route from Europe. The president has said in recent weeks that the US is considering direct strikes on Venezuelan territory, and that he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert activity there. A series of what the military termed “attack demonstration” flights off the Venezuelan coast by US bombers last week were an even more visible indicator of the US’ intentions.\n \n\n   \n  Although the administration has characterized the mission for all those military assets as a counternarcotics effort, the size and scope of the buildup has raised the specter of a possible regime-change operation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump during his first term routinely demanded that he be provided military options to pressure Maduro. But White House officials felt that they were given the runaround by Pentagon and intelligence leaders, whom multiple sources described as reluctant to initiate or escalate a conflict with Venezuela. In one meeting at the White House in 2019, a top Pentagon official reportedly  banged his fist on the table  in frustration after repeated demands from White House officials for more aggressive options.\n \n\n   \n  “In the first Trump administration, he said that all options are on the table,” said Jimmy Story, who was the top US diplomat to Venezuela from 2018 to 2023. “Many of the options are now at the front door.”\n \n\n   \n  The lesson Trump likely took from that earlier era — when a series of officials sought to temper the US policy towards Maduro — was that he would not be stymied this time, said one former senior administration official: “I told these guys I wanted the military option in 2018 and 2019, they didn’t give me one — I want a real one now,” this person said, summing up the president’s thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and CIA did not provide comment for this story ahead of publication when contacted by CNN. Cyber Command declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Get it done’\n \n\n   \n  Trump first requested military options to remove Maduro from power from his second national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, at a meeting at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2017, according to a former White House official. He told the assembled press later that day: “I’m not going to rule out a military option for Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  He would return to the request more than once, as he pressed subsequent national security advisers to find a way to get rid of the Maduro regime and grew increasingly frustrated that it hadn’t happened.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it done,” Trump told his national security adviser John Bolton in August of 2019, meaning oust Maduro, Bolton wrote in his book. “This is the fifth time I’ve asked for it,” Trump continued.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials began to sense that senior leaders in both the Pentagon and the CIA were resistant to the idea of using force. They weren’t wrong, according to a former senior intelligence official and three former administration officials.\n \n\n   \n  Within the administration, CIA Director Gina Haspel was widely known to be opposed to using agency personnel to carry out covert operations against Maduro, those sources said, and at times resisted suggestions from the White House for proposed action. With pressure building from the White House for covert action, there was a lack of consensus at the CIA and at the Pentagon about what would be effective at pressuring Maduro to leave office. The CIA has a long history of interference in Latin American affairs during the Cold War, including failed regime changes, that has created greater reticence from agency leaders.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, the administration coalesced around a strategy to offer diplomatic and economic support to the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, officially recognizing him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. More than 50 countries would eventually recognize Guaido as the country’s head of state.\n \n\n   \n  “The regime was shaky, and we thought that the opposition had a good chance,” one of the former senior administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But that effort foundered as it became clear that Guaido had no practical means of actually assuming power in Venezuela.  No massive street protests arose, the military remained loyal to Maduro, and, after a failed coup attempt in the spring of 2019, Guaido remained a president without a government to run.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was “pissed,” according to the former White House official. In his mind, Guaido and the opposition “failed him,” that person and others said — but so had his own government, which had effectively backed a losing horse.\n \n\n   \n    Covert action\n \n\n   \n  The president lost his appetite for focusing on Venezuela during the second half of his second term, following the opposition’s failed coup, according to multiple former administration officials. But Trump had also adopted an even more hawkish view of Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  The desire increased among White House officials for using covert operations and cyberattacks to cause disruptions in Venezuela, and for collecting intelligence on the regime, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Cyber Command, the US military’s offensive and defensive cyber unit, conducted a cyberattack in the latter half of Trump’s first term to interrupt the satellite communications of the Wagner Group, Russian mercenaries who then reportedly had a presence in Venezuela, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military also considered setting up a special team, staffed with Coast Guard personnel, to focus on hacking drug traffickers and collecting intelligence to support US counter-narcotic efforts, according to the sources. The team would have had a heavy Venezuela focus, but concern about legal authorities and bureaucratic hurdles prevented the idea from turning to action.\n \n\n   \n  Other ideas never got off the ground. An administration official proposed knocking a hydroelectric dam in Venezuela offline with a cyberattack, one of the sources said, but the idea seemed half- baked and never made it to the desk of the Pentagon’s cyber operations planners.\n \n\n   \n  The hope was that aggressive covert action could cause enough discomfort and create sufficient disturbances that the military, which has played a critical role in keeping Maduro in power, would be convinced to switch sides and support the opposition, said the former White House official.\n \n\n   \n  But other officials criticized that strategy as lacking solid planning for the day after, the former White House official said — who added that history appears to be repeating itself\n \n\n   \n  “Opposition doesn’t have a plan. We don’t have a plan,” that person said. “Hope is not a plan.”\n \n\n   \n  There were signs that Trump might soften his approach to Venezuela in his second term, according to Story, the former diplomat. Special envoy Richard Grenell has met several times with Maduro to try to secure the release of US citizens wrongfully detained in the country, for example. But in recent months Trump ordered Grenell to stand down, and officials say the Venezuela portfolio is now largely being driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Venezuela hawk.\n \n\n   \n  “Then the hawks took over,” Story said, “so now it’s ‘maximum pressure’ to another level.”\n \n\n   \n  He declined to comment on any covert action.\n \n\n   \n  In the midst of the military buildup, the Trump administration has carried out a series of lethal military strikes against small, go-fast boats including some that have left Venezuelan ports. The Defense Department insists they are trafficking drugs, although it has provided no evidence and Venezuela is not a major producer or transit point for drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  What the administration’s end game is remains unclear. Some, like Story, say that they would be “very surprised” if the US ships in the Caribbean were not “deployed in some way” against the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a force capable of invading the country, but it could potentially be a force capable of doing highly sophisticated rendition of senior leadership in the country,” Story told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump, who rose to power in part through his criticism of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is also keenly aware of the political risks of backtracking on his noninterventionist bona fides. In the end, the former White House official said, the famously mercurial president could find any number of ways to declare “victory” in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “This is wag the dog,” this person said, “This is anything you want it to be.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/health/viral-infections-heart-disease-risk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Common Viral Infections Like Flu and Shingles Can Raise Your Risk of Heart Attack and Stroke, Analysis Finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Heart Association reveals that common viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, HIV, hepatitis C, and shingles are linked to increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, and coronary heart disease — both immediately after infection and over the long term.

\n       \n  By Asuka Koda, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Covid-19 infections have been  strongly linked  with cardiovascular conditions   like heart disease and stroke, but new research shows that other viral infections such as influenza, HIV, hepatitis C and shingles can also increase the risk of heart problems and cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, reviewed 155 studies spanning decades and found that viral infections can raise the risk of heart disease both immediately after an infection and over the long term.\n \n\n   \n  People who caught the flu were up to six times more likely to have a heart attack in the month after the infection, and those who had Covid-19 had nearly twice the risk of developing heart disease or stroke compared with people who hadn’t been infected.\n \n\n   \n  “One way to prevent this is really vaccination,” said lead study author Dr. Kosuke Kawai, an adjunct professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Often, we get vaccinated to reduce the risk of influenza or other illness, but I think vaccines can provide additional benefit in terms of potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease.”\n \n\n   \n  The authors of the new research concluded that influenza and Covid-19 infections were associated with higher risk of acute cardiovascular events such as heart attacks. Chronic viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C and shingles were associated with a long-­term increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n \n\n   \n  The new study also notes that cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis A, human papillomavirus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and chikungunya have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but it says more research on the association is needed.\n \n\n   \n    How does a virus affect the heart?\n \n\n   \n  The new findings fit with what clinicians have long observed, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, many infections can do this,” he said. “Respiratory viruses increase cardiovascular risk in two ways”: indirectly, by triggering an overactive immune response that causes inflammation, leading to stress and blood clotting that affects the heart; or directly, when the virus can attack heart tissue itself.\n \n\n   \n  Most respiratory viruses, including Covid-19, flu and RSV, act through the indirect pathway, Roberts said, while enterovirus strains – related to the viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease – can directly infect the heart muscle.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the more severe the viral illness, the greater the risk of cardiovascular complications,” he said. These infections can also worsen existing heart problems like heart failure, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Kawai said it’s hard to quantify how likely it is for someone with a viral infection to develop cardiovascular disease, so everyone should take protective measures.\n \n\n   \n  “It also depends on the viral infection,” Kawai said. “It’s not just the patients who have underlying increased risk for cardiovascular disease that might be at greater risk, but those who are younger adults, or people who might not necessarily have some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are also at increased risk” after a viral infection.\n \n\n   \n    Prevention is key\n \n\n   \n  “Our study highlights the importance of integrated preventive measures, especially for adults with traditional risk factors for [cardiovascular disease]. Vaccines may play an important role in preventing the risk of CVD,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  They concluded that preventive measures such as vaccination and timely antiviral treatment could help reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, which remains the world’s leading cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  “Vaccines for many of these viruses exist and generally lessen the risk of cardiovascular events after infection, since the severe infection is more likely to be mild in a vaccinated individual,” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  In people who have a healthy immune system, vaccines are protective without causing cardiovascular disease because they typically contain a small amount of an inactivated virus or specific subunits from the pathogen, Kawai said. The inactivated virus does not trigger an overactive immune response that causes inflammation that affects the heart, nor is it able to attack heart tissues themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who is concerned about the risk of heart problems after an infection should talk with their doctor, Roberts advises.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/air-traffic-control-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"The future of air traffic control grows more uncertain as the federal government shutdown continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal government shutdown, which has lasted nearly 30 days as of October 29, 2025, is severely disrupting the U.S. air traffic control system.

control grows more uncertain as the federal government shutdown continues \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The impact of the federal government shutdown on the air traffic control system in the United States could linger on well beyond the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  From safety redundancies and modernization efforts to training future controllers and keeping the best staff, much of the work of the Federal Aviation Administration could see long term harms from the shutdown, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no question that the shutdown will only set us backwards,” said Erik Hansen, senior vice president and head of government relations for the US Travel Association. “The real risk is that it will do irreparable harm to our efforts to hire more air traffic controllers and to modernize air traffic control.”\n \n\n   \n  When the current staff of 14,000 air traffic controllers looked at their bank accounts on payday this week, there was nothing deposited.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers are required to show up for their job during the government shutdown but are not being paid. A zero-dollar paystub was processed for every controller on Tuesday, the first in the nearly 30-day shutdown period, with no clear end in sight.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been clear to air traffic controllers; they need to show up for work,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news conference Tuesday. “They do really important work for our country, and they need to show up. But I’m not going to lie to anybody to not say that they’re not feeling the stress.”\n \n\n   \n  Some controllers are left with no choice but to accumulate debt or make difficult financial decisions to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  “We make the impossible look possible every single day, but now with the shutdown, we’re making the impossible impossible for people to continue to live without money,” Nick Daniels, the president of the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers said this month. “Instead of focusing on the safety of the American flying public, they’re now focusing on what they can’t afford to pay.”\n \n\n   \n    Every day of the shutdown is ‘less safe’\n \n\n   \n  Transportation officials and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association have warned of the risks to the controller workforce if the shutdown persists. Many cite the struggles the financial strain can take on controller focus, which can hinder aviation safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Air traffic controllers are showing up to work, but we’re being put in a position that every day that this is less safe,” Daniels, said Tuesday. “I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, how do I pay my rent? Rent is due in a few days, how to put food on the table, how to put gas in my car just to show up to work. And those are levels of safety that are being reduced in the system, and the flying public doesn’t deserve that.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘They should never get off a night shift and then go wait tables’\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of the shutdown, the Department of Transportation and Duffy have said controllers were considering taking second jobs to make ends meet in the event of no pay. Duffy previously cited controllers talking about driving for rideshare companies like Uber or delivering food on DoorDash to pay bills.\n \n\n   \n  It’s something that Daniels, whose union represents nearly 20,000 controllers and other aviation workers, said should never happen.\n \n\n   \n  “(Controllers) should never work a side job,” Daniels said. “They should never get off a night shift and then go wait tables and then go move the commerce and people through this airspace.”\n \n\n   \n  That “pressure is real,” controller Joe Segretto, who handles flights approaching and departing New York, said Tuesday at a news conference at LaGuardia airport.\n \n\n   \n  “Somebody came to me and said… ‘I need your advice. What am I to do? Do I put gas in my car? Do I put food on the table We don’t have money for daycare. What do I do?’ I didn’t have the answers,” Segretto said.\n \n\n   \n  “Almost every controller… can’t make it without two paychecks,” Duffy said, noting the situation will only get worse.\n \n\n   \n    Short circuiting supercharged hiring and new technology\n \n\n   \n  The air traffic control system has been short thousands of controllers for years.   \n \n\n   \n  At the beginning of the year, Duffy announced plans to “supercharge” hiring at the FAA, which came with pay bumps and a streamlined hiring processes.\n \n\n   \n  In September, before the shutdown, the DOT said it met its hiring goals for the year by recruiting more than 2,000 people to combat the shortage. The FAA’s air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City was the “busiest” it has ever been,  an FAA official told CNN in July,  with roughly 800 to 1,000 more trainees in the pipeline than a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  But now, some long-sought after trainees are leaving to pursue careers with more financial stability.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an air traffic controller today and you’ve gone through the financial hardship of a shutdown, you’re going to be looking for potentially new career paths or other opportunities,” Hansen said.\n \n\n   \n  The funding to pay trainees is also beginning to run out, according to Duffy. Future controllers get stipends to make ends meet as they go through schooling.  If that stops, it “will be cataclysmic for them,” he said. “That money is about to run out, and we’re seeing several of our students drop out of the Academy.”\n \n\n   \n  The DOT also incentivized controllers approaching the mandatory retirement age of 56 to stay on the job earlier this year. A lump sum payment of 20% of the basic pay of a retirement eligible controller was promised for each year they continue to work.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to have a tougher hill to climb to get back to staffing levels that can not only keep the country safe, but keep air travel growing,” Hansen said. “We’re going to have a tougher hill to climb to modernize the system.”\n \n\n   \n  In May, the DOT announced it would replace decades old infrastructure by building an entirely new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the DOT secured a $12.5 billion “down payment” in Congressional funding to take steps like replacing the decades-old copper wiring with fiberoptic lines.\n \n\n   \n  While that money is still available for the modernization efforts, the DOT has trouble spending some of it due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have the staff in place, because they’ve been furloughed, to actually execute the agreements or do the oversight that’s necessary by federal law for these projects,” Duffy said last week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/asia/cyclone-montha-everest-tourism-nepal-tibet-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"02:01:00-04:00","title":"Helicopter crashes during rescue amid unseasonably heavy snowfall that halts Everest tourism in Nepal, Tibet","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe weather event driven by Cyclone Montha caused unseasonably heavy snowfall across the Himalayas, leading to widespread closures of tourism in both Nepal and Tibet.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a landmark meeting with Donald Trump expected this week is a moment to showcase something Beijing has long sought: China standing as an equal to the United States on the global stage.\n \n\n   \n  The US president’s trade war against China has challenged Xi’s drive for growth and innovation, but it’s also given Beijing the unintended gift of a bright spotlight under which to flex its economic strength.\n \n\n   \n  As much of the rest of the world scrambled to flatter Trump and negotiate down  global tariffs he unleashed this spring , China fought back with its own measures – until both sides were forced to the table for a truce.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, after US rules hit China’s access to American technology and targeted its shipping industry, Beijing fired back by announcing a  sweeping expansion of export controls  on critical rare earth minerals – a move that rattled Washington and pushed Trump to threaten to pile an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have appeared to climb down from that latest escalation following  eleventh-hour trade talks  between top negotiators this weekend in Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi and Trump are now set to meet on the sidelines of an  international summit in South Korea  Thursday – their first face-to-face meeting of Trump’s second term, where they’re expected to agree to a framework for managing their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear what each side has agreed to concede to get to that point – and this is just one touchstone in a complex and volatile competition between superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  But it will also be a moment where Xi is entering the room after cementing a new reality in US-China relations: China will negotiate, but it won’t be cowed.\n \n\n   \n    ‘China is very calm’\n \n\n   \n  All that doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high for Xi.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of the US and China working together on global threats as a “G2” of the world’s most powerful economies, Beijing sees a US that aims to hinder its rise with tariffs, high-tech export controls and political friction.\n \n\n   \n  Current US tariffs on Chinese goods – which stand at upwards of 50% on average – are putting pressure on the country’s already slowing economy, and those could more than double if the two leaders can’t find common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But as US officials tout Trump’s ability to “create leverage” to pressure China, over on Beijing’s half of the split-screen, China, too, sees success in its strategy.\n \n\n   \n  There, the common sense is that China is ready for this contest: it’s created natural leverage through its strategic dominance over the global rare earths supply chain; it’s diversified trade to become less dependent on the US market and it’s been pushing to accelerate innovation that would allow it to wean off American goods like high-end semi-conductors.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was “fully prepared” for how Trump might act toward China when he started his second term, according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  “But from the US side, any tariff or any measures taken (by) the Chinese side has helped President Trump himself to learn the capacity of China is different from eight years ago … and he understands that what is changed – is the US is not the dominant power anymore,” Wang said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is also continuing its push to insulate itself from future shocks – including in its  upcoming five-year plan , which aims to deepen a top-down drive for tech and industrial self-sufficiency.\n \n\n   \n  “China is very calm in facing all these conflicts and difficulties set up by United States,” Wang Wen, dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies think tank at Renmin University in Beijing, told a gathering of reporters last week in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States is still a major partner, however, among China’s landscape, the US is losing its importance,” Wang added.\n \n\n   \n    Two strongmen\n \n\n   \n  Both sides gave positive signals after trade talks over the weekend, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting Beijing would defer its controls on rare earths, while the US would pull back its 100% tariff threat and extend an earlier tariff truce.\n \n\n   \n  But China has not made such statements, and there’s still a risk that the two strongmen can’t see eye to eye or a rogue comment throws off the delicate detente. And, as is often the case with Trump’s diplomacy, much may come down to the day-of chemistry between the two leaders, who last met in 2019. Such dynamics were on show Tuesday in Japan, where Trump hit it off with the country’s new conservative prime minister,  Sanae Takaishi , and promised that if Japan needed any favors the US would be there.\n \n\n   \n  In his Trump meeting, Xi’s top priorities will be aiming to see the US reduce tariffs and roll back export controls, analysts say. To make that happen, he may be willing to ease or defer China’s latest export controls on rare earths.\n \n\n   \n  China imposed those controls to “coerce the US to not to put sweeping sanctions on China,” but rather to limit its sanctions to a “very few national security fields,” said Shanghai-based foreign affairs analyst Shen Dingli.\n \n\n   \n  Whether that works in practice will be put to the test Thursday in a meeting where Beijing is hoping Trump will treat Xi with the kind of respect and warmth for the Chinese leader that he’s professed in recent months and on the campaign trail.\n \n\n   \n  China’s top diplomat Wang gave a subtle reminder of that in his call with Rubio Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Xi and Trump were “both world-class leaders, who have engaged with each other over a long period and with mutual respect,” Wang said, according to a readout. “Upholding the spirit of equality, respect, and mutual benefit,” he added, was a key condition for “moving the bilateral relationship forward.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/johnson-trump-2028-third-term","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Johnson says he’s spoken with Trump about ‘the constrictions of the Constitution’ on a third term","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, confirmed that he has spoken with President Donald Trump about the possibility of a third-term bid, citing the 22nd Amendment as a major constitutional barrier.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday said he has spoken with Donald Trump about the possibility of the president seeking a third-term but that he sees no path for it as any change to the US Constitution would be well after Trump has left office.\n \n\n   \n  “Well, there’s the 22nd Amendment,” Johnson, who is a constitutional lawyer, said in response to a question about his comfort-level with the president floating a 2028 bid.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a great run. But I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about, the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The president, he said, is trolling members of the other party when he talks publicly about the topic.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that’s ever been produced. And he has a good time with that, trolling the Democrats, whose hair is on fire about the very prospect,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leader’s acknowledgment that he and Trump have discussed issues surrounding a third-term adds credence to warnings from the president’s opponents that he is seriously flirting with upending the Constitution. But Johnson’s quickly throwing cold water on the suggestion underscores how little support Trump would have if he actually tried to move forward with it.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he had spoken with Trump Tuesday morning while the president is overseas in Japan, but he did not specify when the pair had discussed the Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Amending the Constitution, he noted, would be a lengthy and arduous process, saying, “I don’t see a way to amend the Constitution, because it takes about 10 years to do that, as you all know, to allow all the states to ratify … what two-thirds of the House, three-fourth of the states would approve. So I don’t, I don’t see the path for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Monday  continued to entertain  the idea of running for a third term, telling reporters that he’d “love to do it,” while also floating the possibility of a Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio pairing in 2028. But he did rule out one proposed end-run around the Constitution, saying it would be “too cute” for him to run as vice president in order to later ascend back into the White House after the elected president resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the people wouldn’t like that because it’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right,” he said, although he tried to reserve the legal right to do it.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday morning local time, Trump said, “Based on what I read, I guess I’m not allowed to run, so we’ll see what happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “I would say that if you read it, [the Constitution] it’s pretty clear, I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad. But we have a lot of great people.”\n \n\n   \n  At the White House, Trump has joked about running for a third term and  Trump 2028 hats  are on display in a room near the Oval Office. Recently, Trump posted images of the ’28 hats on the Resolute Desk when the House and Senate minority leaders, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, came to the Oval Office. But some people close to the president say that inside the administration, a third term is not viewed as something he is seriously considering or planning to do.\n \n\n   \n  The idea of running for a third term is “like catnip” for the media and Democrats, Trump’s allies argue, ginning up the type of attention the president enjoys, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  That attention intensified last week when The Economist published an interview with Steve Bannon, a MAGA influencer and former Trump adviser, who claimed “there is a plan” for Trump to run for a third term. Bannon is notably far less close to the president and his team than he was during Trump’s first term, and some White House officials viewed his comments as an attempt to draw attention to himself. But the seemingly outlandish ideas of Trump and people in his orbit sometimes find their way to reality.\n \n\n   \n  The sources insisted Trump isn’t actually plotting a 2028 campaign. That is not only because it would take a Constitutional amendment to make it legal, but the president is also aware of his age and cares deeply about his legacy. People close to him argue he never wants to be viewed like former President Joe Biden, whose age and health became a fixture of his presidency. If Trump were to take office again for a third term, he would be 82 years old.\n \n\n   \n  “He said publicly he’s not gonna do a third term. Anytime it comes up, it’s Trump being Trump. He’s going to do the ‘Many people would love that!’ thing,” a person close to Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  They also argued the president doesn’t like to point out that he only has three years left, trying to swat away any talk of him being a lame duck president.\n \n\n   \n  The person close to the president argued that not only is Trump “not seriously thinking about 2028, no one is seriously thinking about it right now,” including people that Trump has hinted could succeed him, like Vance and Rubio.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s something we all expect to play more of a role come the midterms,” they said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/ncaa-delays-athlete-gambling-rule-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-04:00","title":"NCAA Delays Rule Change Permitting College Athletes to Bet on Professional Sports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA has delayed a rule change that would allow college athletes and athletic department staff to bet on professional sports, pushing the effective date from November 1 to November 22.

But when the Supreme Court hears his appeal next week, it may be influenced by a forceful dissenting opinion that highlighted a 1981 case from the Iranian hostage crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts knows that case well. He helped produce it, as a 26-year-old law clerk to then-Justice William Rehnquist.\n \n\n   \n  Rehnquist wrote the opinion in  Dames & Moore v. Regan  during a hectic week that June – a “mad scramble,” Rehnquist told his fellow justices in a memo. He caught viral pneumonia in the middle of writing the opinion. Roberts himself was in the last frantic days of his clerkship and trying to study for an upcoming bar exam.\n \n\n   \n  The case tested financial aspects of a deal struck by President Jimmy Carter to use frozen Iranian assets as a “bargaining chip” to  win the release of 52 American hostages . Among the laws Carter invoked was the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump is now citing to justify certain tariffs, including on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China.\n \n\n   \n  The Constitution gives Congress the power to set tariffs, and while IEEPA, which was passed in 1977, has previously been used to impose economic penalties, it was never used for tariffs. The law authorizes the president to “regulate … importation” of goods to deal with a national emergency arising from an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the US.\n \n\n   \n  A seven-justice majority of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  rejected the Trump administration’s arguments  in August, finding that while IEEPA gives the president authority for many kinds of actions in response to a national emergency, the disputed tariffs exceed that authority.\n \n\n   \n  But dissenting Judge Richard Taranto, joined by three other judges, countered that the Supreme Court has recognized “broad authority” for the president within IEEPA’s power to “regulate.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto  highlighted the Dames & Moore case . “There, the Court held that IEEPA authorized the President to take action involving Iranian assets as leverage to solve a problem based on Iran’s holding of American hostages,” Taranto wrote. “The Supreme Court blessed the measure as a ‘bargaining chip to be used by the President when dealing with a hostile country.’ Similarly, here, the tariffs are to be a ‘bargaining chip’ to get Canada, Mexico, and China to take more action regarding the criminal trafficking identified in the executive orders.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has embraced Taranto’s arguments as part of its appeal to the Supreme Court defending the tariffs that have brought the US treasury billions of dollars but raised consumer prices and caused widespread economic upheaval.\n \n\n   \n    An urgent, end-of-term, case\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  Roberts, who declined CNN’s request for comment on this story, was just finishing his year-long clerkship in Rehnquist’s chambers when Dames & Moore v. Regan landed. (The justices typically hand down all their opinions for the session by the end of June.)\n \n\n   \n  Rehnquist, appointed in 1972 by President Richard Nixon, was serving as an associate justice at the time. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the chief justice spot; Roberts succeeded Rehnquist in 2005.\n \n\n   \n  The hostage deal negotiated by Carter and endorsed by his successor Reagan required court orders involving frozen Iranian assets to be nullified and transferred to an international tribunal. Dames & Moore, an engineering firm that had won an earlier judgment against Iran, brought a lawsuit against the US Department of Treasury when its judgment was voided as part of the deal. (Donald Regan was Treasury Secretary at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  A US district court dismissed the claim, and Dames & Moore petitioned the Supreme Court in early June 1981 to quickly resolve the matter, because the assets were set to be transferred in mid-July.\n \n\n   \n  When the Dames & Moore petition came in, the justices considered it in a private vote on June 11. Rehnquist, at this initial stage, wanted to reject it and let the US district court order favoring the government stand.\n \n\n   \n  But he and another justice who apparently felt the court was being “stampeded” were outvoted, according to materials reviewed by CNN from the archives of Rehnquist and other justices. The majority believed the court had an institutional obligation to swiftly resolve the case, and oral arguments were held on June 24 as the justices were already moving at a frenzied pace to finish writing their final opinions of the term.\n \n\n   \n  After two hours of courtroom arguments, the justices took their customary private vote and had immediate unanimity to affirm the lower court and uphold the deal. The nine, however, varied in their reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Chief Justice Warren Burger tapped Rehnquist, known for his speed and ability to juggle multiple demands, to craft the opinion for the court. Burger wrote to the others: “To ‘get the show on the road’ Bill Rehnquist has agreed to get an opinion in our hands by noon Sunday, next – if not before.”\n \n\n   \n  According to handwritten notes in his archive at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, Rehnquist broke down the various issues (IEEPA, the Hostage Act, relevant precedent) and detailed the sentiment of his colleagues by their initials. Working with Roberts and two other clerks, Rehnquist produced the first draft within two days and sent it around to the other justices that Friday.\n \n\n   \n  As happens in negotiations over any case, various justices wanted amendments. Rehnquist was accommodating but also mindful of the impending deadline, telling his colleagues in a note, “we are in something of a mad scramble right now, trying to tailor the opinion to the votes taken….”\n \n\n   \n  They finished the decision for public release on July 2. Reviewing the history of IEEPA and an earlier law it replaced, Rehnquist wrote that Carter had acted within the authority granted by Congress as he dealt with the Iranian financial claims.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the distinct nature of the case and the rushed consideration prompted Rehnquist to warn at the outset of the court’s opinion, “We attempt to lay down no general ‘guidelines’ covering other situations not involved here, and attempt to confine the opinion only to the very questions necessary to decision of the case.”\n \n\n   \n    What does Dames & Moore actually mean?\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  The interpretation of Dames & Moore is one of many questions before the current justices on their own expedited, but not as rushed, schedule. One consideration will be whether Trump’s move  violates a relatively new court doctrine  that dictates that when the president takes steps of vast “economic and political significance,” clear congressional authorization is required for those steps.\n \n\n   \n  On the core question of the breadth of IEEPA’s coverage, Trump’s legal team has drawn on Taranto’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “As Judge Taranto explained, ‘IEEPA embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm,’” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote, defending the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Regarding the national threat, Sauer said tariffs were imposed “to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stop the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders.”\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff challengers contend in their filings that the administration is misreading Dames & Moore.\n \n\n   \n  Michael McConnell, lead counsel for wine importer VOS Selections, tells the justices the case stands for the opposite of what the administration argues. He said it advises judges, in fact, to pay “close attention to the IEEPA’s text and established practice,” which would disallow “an unprecedented, worldwide tariff regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the many outside organizations siding with the challengers is a group of economists who say even if the IEEPA allowed for the imposition of tariffs, there is no real emergency to address.\n \n\n   \n  Trade deficits “have existed consistently over the past fifty years in the United States …” the  group writes . “They are thus not ‘unusual and extraordinary’ but rather ordinary and commonplace.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, but he is widely recognized as non-ideological on the specialized Federal Circuit court that resolves international trade, patent and trademark disputes.\n \n\n   \n  The judge is also known to many of the justices, having taken a similar path to the bench. Three years after Roberts clerked for Rehnquist, Taranto served in the chambers of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Taranto also argued often before the high court, as an assistant US solicitor general and then as a lawyer in private practice before his 2013 appointment.\n \n\n   \n    One last test\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  Back on July 2, 1981, after Rehnquist and his clerks had finished the opinion, Justice William Brennan, the senior liberal, sent Rehnquist a note, with copies all around: “Congratulations again upon a truly splendid job. I’m happy to join.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Lewis Powell quickly began drafting a similar note of appreciation. Materials in his files show that Powell first addressed only the effort of Rehnquist: “I join in thanking and congratulating you on a super accomplishment.” Powell added a handwritten change to be typed up: “congratulating you –  and your Chambers  – on a super accomplishment … ”\n \n\n   \n  The finished decision was not without some personal cost. Rehnquist caught viral pneumonia and ended up in the emergency room just as he was finishing the opinion. He quickly recovered but faced other obstacles as he was trying to fly to Vermont for a scheduled family vacation.\n \n\n   \n  “Meanwhile,” Rehnquist wrote on July 2 to his fellow justices, “I find that I lost my wallet at the Bethesda Hospital Emergency Room on Sunday, and have become virtually a ’stateless’ person. Yesterday I got a temporary driver’s license, but that has to be converted into a regular duplicate by Monday or all of my driving will be illegal.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Roberts tried to catch up on his studies for the bar exam that month and prepare for a job in the Reagan administration beginning in August.\n \n\n   \n  His study partner for the District of Columbia bar exam happened to be a fellow clerk, from the Brennan chambers that term: McConnell, now the lead counsel suing Trump over the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Both men  passed .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/trump-military-speech-japan-hegseth-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Why Trump’s growing politicization of the military could backfire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is increasingly politicizing the U.S. military by using it as a platform for political messaging and domestic policy advocacy, including false claims about the 2020 election and proposing the deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops into cities to address crime and immigration.

Trump’s growing politicization of the military could backfire \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What’s the difference between the flight deck of a mighty US aircraft carrier and a MAGA rally? Not much in the mind of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The commander in chief used a speech on the USS George Washington, moored in Japan Tuesday, to  revive 2020 election falsehoods  and to campaign for his constitutionally questionable plan to send troops into US cities.\n \n\n   \n  Once, such political activity using the military as a backdrop would have provoked shock back home. But Trump has infringed so many customs of the presidency that it came as no surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The president recently had service members cheering a  deeply partisan speech  at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that troubled many former senior officers. He staged a  parade through Washington  to mark the  Army’s 250th anniversary  — which coincided with his birthday. He rambled in a speech before top brass flown from around the globe in Virginia last month. The generals and admirals were also treated to an anti-“woke” screed from  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth . Most notoriously, in his first term, Trump enlisted Gen. Mark Milley to march with him after demonstrators were cleared from outside the White House. The then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  apologized for being pulled into domestic politics  and landed on Trump’s forever enemies list.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made a spectacular entrance Tuesday before hundreds of sailors and service personnel, descending on a huge elevator with military jets as a backdrop. His speech on the USS George Washington was a classic weave. He claimed to have dreamed of being an admiral and indulged his obsession about the best way to power catapults that carriers use to launch their warplanes into the sky.\n \n\n   \n  But he also touched on fiercely political issues in front of nonpartisan officers and enlisted personnel, previewing an expansion of his effort to  send troops into US cities  in a constitutionally questionable  crime and immigration purge .\n \n\n   \n  “We have cities that are troubled. We can’t have cities that are troubled and we are sending in our National Guard,” Trump said. “And if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard because we’re going to have safe cities. We’re not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that’s what we’re doing,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  The timing of his threat to use American troops against Americans was jarring. It came two days before he’s due to meet in South Korea with President Xi Jinping, head of the Chinese Communist Party, which turned its military on its own people to break up the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plans bear no comparison to that historic outrage. But the symbolism of his efforts to use the military to bolster his own strongman image is clear.\n \n\n   \n    The military isn’t immune from politics — but tries to avoid them\n \n\n   \n  So far in his second term, Trump has deployed the National Guard to protect federal facilities in Los Angeles; Chicago; and Portland, Oregon, triggering multiple court cases and challenging laws that prevent the deployment of troops on US soil in a law enforcement capacity. He has used reserve troops to back crime crackdowns in Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington, DC. Last week, the president shelved a plan to send troops into San Francisco after an intervention by top tech industry executives. Trump’s critics argue, and some judges have ruled, that he’s exaggerated conditions in US cities and exceeded his powers under the same Constitution that serving members of the military take an oath to uphold.\n \n\n   \n  Every president loves to be cheered by the troops where voters will see. But most take pains not to subject service members to uncomfortable political positions. Trump’s presidency, however, is a lesson in trampling decorum. His flouting of convention is one reason he’s so popular among his MAGA fans.\n \n\n   \n  There are sound reasons for presidents to try to avoid politicizing the military. The integrity of a civilian-led volunteer force depends on not being seen as a tool of either party. This apolitical shield protects personnel as well as Pentagon budget requests, which often benefit from bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Many in Trump’s military audiences might share his politics. But US security depends on them saluting whoever is commander in chief in future.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the military isn’t immune from politics. It reflects society, so divisive issues like health care for LGBTQ members or racial and gender equality always ripple through the ranks. Trump’s team came to office determined to reverse what they claimed was a progressive slide.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth slashed diversity, equity and inclusion programs and loosened rules of combat designed to protect civilians. He  ordered trans people out  of the forces, has questioned  the fitness of women for active service  and relieved  high-ranking officers  of their duties — several of whom are minorities.\n \n\n   \n  “This administration has done a great deal from day one to remove the social justice, politically correct, and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics,” Hegseth told the senior officers at Quantico, Virginia, last month. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions.”\n \n\n   \n  It would be hard to find a more politicized speech from a defense secretary. Senior officers sat in silence, observing regulations that bar them taking part in political activity or partisan campaigning.\n \n\n   \n    Presidents always walk a fine political line with the military\n \n\n   \n  Trump is not the first president to be accused of politicizing the military. Some Republicans  argued  that former President Bill Clinton launched air strikes in Iraq to distract from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Democrats believed President George W. Bush’s pre-war speeches to troops were a politicized campaign for what they saw as an illegal invasion of Iraq. In 2022, Republicans  criticized President Joe Biden  for having two Marines flank him during a speech in Philadelphia, in which he branded Trump a threat to “equality and democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President’s use of active duty Marines as political props undermines the apolitical nature of our servicemembers and erodes trust in our military,” several GOP lawmakers  wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin  at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In his nearly 10 months back in office, Trump has staged far greater transgressions — but, as is often the case, faced no Republican blowback.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/threatened-synagogue-attacks-alabama","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00Z","title":"Man arrested with body armor and a suitcase filled with ammunition after threatening multiple synagogues, officials say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 33-year-old man named Jeremy Wayne Shoemaker was arrested in Clarke County, Alabama, with body armor and a suitcase filled with ammunition after threatening multiple synagogues in Alabama and surrounding states.

\n  By Boer Deng, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump sits down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week,  trade will be the subject at hand .\n \n\n   \n  But it is also an opportunity for something else: a chance to secure the release of US citizens detained by the People’s Republic.\n \n\n   \n  More Americans are thought to be imprisoned in China, some 200 in total, than in any other country,  according to the Foley Foundation,  which advocates for American hostages and those wrongfully detained overseas. Most are believed to be ethnically Chinese Americans who have been ensnared by Beijing’s strict security apparatus and detained for posing a threat to China’s “national security.”\n \n\n   \n  A smaller number are jailed for breaking local laws, sometimes unwittingly.\n \n\n   \n  A campaign to free two Americans jailed for more than a decade after falling victim to scams has gathered steam following months of advocacy, reaching high into the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  In May, the State Department issued a request for the release of Dawn Michelle Hunt and Nelson Wells Jr. on humanitarian grounds. Last month, a bipartisan bill named for the pair was put forward in the House to expand diplomatic advocacy on behalf of Americans held in China.\n \n\n   \n  And in a letter sent last week to the White House, Republican lawmakers urged Trump to raise their cases and those of others as part of trade talks with Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n \n\n   \n  The last-minute lobbying effort comes amid what officials, campaigners and the families of Hunt and Wells say is the best opportunity to secure their release — before it’s too late. Both detainees are ill. Though they have access to some health care, their families say they will not survive much longer in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Tim Hunt saw his sister Dawn Michelle last summer for the first time in a decade from behind the glass partition of a visiting booth in a Chinese prison, under the watchful eye of minders who sat not 2 yards away.\n \n\n   \n  Her hair was so thin, so gray, he recalled. “I’m oldest of three,” he said, so it was like he had helped raise her. “So I know every facial expression” — the pain, the anger, the change etched into her features.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her before I left — I’m like, ‘This is not your existence. I will get you out of here,’” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has often claimed that he is uniquely capable of striking deals no one can, and that releasing American from foreign jails is a top priority. \n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, the administration has touted the return of a Chinese American  Wells Fargo executive  and called for the release of a prominent Christian leader whose children are American citizens.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates say that winning the releases of Hunt and Wells would not only send a message that Trump cares about the issue of detentions abroad, but could also set a wider precedent for securing the release of other Americans considered unjustly held in China.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not rich, we’re not superstars, we’re not politically connected; we’re just regular people,” Wells’ father, Nelson Wells Sr., told CNN. “If President Trump would stand up for regular people, this would make a statement to the United States of America that he cares.”\n \n\n   \n  Besides Hunt and Wells, eight other cases, including those of detained Chinese and Uyghur Americans, are raised in the letter to Trump.\n \n\n   \n   “ This is something the president and the secretary of state, they should be leading off with this every time they talk to Xi Jinping , ” said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, one of the letter’s co-authors.\n \n\n   \n  “So [that’s] another reason why we need this… [so] Xi Jinping and his hierarchy there see that the Congress and the president are very serious about letting Americans go . ” \n \n\n   \n    Families in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Hunt has been imprisoned in China for 11 years after falling victim to a drug-trafficking scam in 2014. She thought she had won a trip to Australia after entering an online contest in 2014, and as part of her “prize,” her flight had layovers in Hong Kong and China, where she was treated to a hotel stay and given luxury handbags.\n \n\n   \n  The bags turned out to be lined with methamphetamine, discovered when she attempted to clear customs for the next leg of her flight. Like Hunt, Wells Jr. said he was also duped in 2014 into transporting gifts that turned out to be cover for drugs.\n \n\n   \n  When Americans are detained abroad, their case is typically first handled by the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs and the embassy. If the arrest is believed to be unjust, they may be declared “wrongfully detained.”\n \n\n   \n  The designation, defined under a US law called the Levinson Act and conferred by the secretary of state, allows a government office, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, to handle the case. Options like prisoner exchanges and ministerial lobbying then become more likely to be on the table.\n \n\n   \n  But some families and advocates for foreign detainees say the parameters for invoking the law are murky, and those held under exit bans or convictions like Hunt and Wells Jr. are not labeled wrongfully detained. Though they get visits from State Department representatives, families are often in the dark as to how they might seek recourse.\n \n\n   \n  “The first six years were horrible,” Wells Sr. said, describing plea after plea to lawmakers’ offices seeking help for his son. “A lot of money spent on lawyers, financial burdens, the whole nine yards — it wasn’t worth anything,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, everybody was telling us, ‘Be quiet, don’t say anything, this is going to hurt Nelson more than help him,’” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Public lobbying campaign\n \n\n   \n  Last year the Wells and the Hunt families both decided to begin a public lobbying campaign, appearing before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to testify about their relatives’ cases.\n \n\n   \n  Depending on the level of interest and profile of the detainees, decisions about their release can rise to the highest levels of government, according to people familiar with the process.\n \n\n   \n  “If Trump, in going through a list of things with the Chinese, were to indicate that the release of these two Americans would be viewed favorably in Washington, that would certainly be the way to move things,” said  Michael Kovrig , a Canadian former diplomat and Asia analyst.\n \n\n   \n  Kovrig was once detained as part of what was widely seen as a diplomatic tit-for-tat involving frictions among Washington, Ottawa and Beijing. In 2018, he and another Canadian were arrested and accused of espionage shortly after Canada, at the request of the US Justice Department, detained the Chinese businesswoman  Meng Wanzhou , a Huawei executive, as she was leaving Vancouver. The US had accused Meng of breaching sanctions rules and later charged her with fraud.\n \n\n   \n  In Kovrig’s case, his  release was secured  after then-US President Joe Biden raised it with Xi on a phone call.\n \n\n   \n  In discussing the release of the Wells Fargo executive last month, Adam Boehler, the Trump official who leads the hostage envoy’s office, said, “The president has set the tone and made it very clear.” He added that ministers and diplomats are also “explaining that US policy has changed and that it is a huge negative to hold Americans, and that is best expressed directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The State Department said: “We take our commitment to assist US citizens abroad seriously and are closely monitoring their situation and providing consular assistance.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the National Security Council said: “President Trump has been clear that he wants every American detained abroad to return home.” \n \n\n   \n  Senior administration officials are aware of the Hunt and Wells cases, though, as of last week did not have plans for the issue to be raised Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  But James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer who has advised the families, pointed out that China would have reasons to look favorably on releasing them, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The Chinese do not want American citizens dying in their prison,” Zimmerman said. “It doesn’t look good. ” \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood, Alayna Treene and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/monkeys-escape-from-overturned-truck-in-heidelberg-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00-05:00","title":"Monkeys Escape From Overturned Truck on Mississippi Highway","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rhesus monkeys, being transported from the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, escaped from a truck that overturned on Interstate 59 near Heidelberg, Mississippi.

Democrats to rebuke Trump’s Brazil tariffs \n       \n  By Morgan Rimmer, Ted  Barrett, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:03 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Senate passed a resolution Tuesday aimed at ending President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats in a rare bipartisan rebuke of the president over trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  Sens. Rand Paul, Thom Tillis, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and former Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell sided with Democrats in the 52 to 48 vote.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell has long been critical of Trump’s trade policy, and said in a statement ahead of the vote, “Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution, however, isn’t expected to be taken up by the House. Earlier this year, Republicans in the chamber added a measure to a procedural rule blocking members from being able to force a vote on the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution aims to end the  Brazil tariffs  by terminating an emergency declaration from the president.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Kaine, the lead sponsor of the resolution, said before the vote that the president’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was not appropriate, considering that the inciting “emergency” that led to the tariffs was Brazil’s indictment of the country’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n \n\n   \n  “The emergency, with respect to Brazil, the unusual and extreme emergency that threatens the United States, that emanates in whole or in part outside the United States, is the Brazilian decision to prosecute Donald Trump’s friend. How is that an emergency?” he said, noting that the US has a trade surplus with Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine added, “I’m against tariffs generally, unless they’re used very specifically. But I’m also against letting presidents just invent a reason to use emergency powers to do all kinds of things without coming to Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s executive order that kicked off the tariffs  said  that “the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that have undermined the rule of law in Brazil.”\n \n\n   \n  Kaine told reporters earlier Tuesday that senators will also force votes later this week aimed at tariffs on Canada and the global tariffs from Trump’s so-called “liberation day.” Earlier this year, the Senate  voted to adopt  the resolution ending the tariffs on Canada, however, the House did not act.\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia Democrat acknowledged the House will not take up his resolution, and that they don’t have a veto-proof majority backing the measure in the Senate. But he insisted that adopting anti-tariff resolutions will send a strong message to the president.\n \n\n   \n  “I did learn in the, in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,” said Kaine.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/trump-fine-arts-commission-firings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-04:00","title":"White House Fires Commission Charged with Advising the President on Design as Trump Pushes Construction Projects","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has terminated all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal advisory body established in 1910 to guide design and aesthetics in Washington, D.C., as President Donald Trump pushes forward with a series of construction projects including a 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a triumphal arch, and paving over the Rose Garden.

\nUpdated: \n        8:39 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The White House has fired all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics,” according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The firings come as President Donald Trump has sought to impose his style on the nation’s capital through a slate of  construction projects , including a planned  triumphal arch , new White House ballroom, and paving over the Rose Garden.\n \n\n   \n  The firings came via email from an adviser in the Presidential Personnel Office.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission on Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately,” reads the email, which was reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The six members were appointed by former President Joe Biden to serve four-year terms. The commission was established by Congress in 1910 “to advise the federal government on matters pertaining to the arts and national symbols, and to guide the architectural development of Washington, D.C.,” according to its website.\n \n\n   \n  The email received by commission members contains similar wording to those that dismissed Biden appointees on other boards and organizations this year, including the National Capital Planning Commission and the  US Holocaust Memorial Council .\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the full-time government employees who work at the Commission of Fine Arts and was informed via email that all staff are furloughed due to the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n   The Washington Post  was first to report on the arts commission firings.\n \n\n   \n  The firings come as Trump is overseeing a  massive overhaul  of the East Wing of the White House that includes a proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom. Trump has estimated the ballroom will cost “about $300 million” and has said it will be funded by himself and  donors .\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear that the Commission of Fine Arts would have any jurisdiction over the ballroom project. Administration  officials determined  the White House would need approval only from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal construction projects in Washington and its neighboring states, Virginia and Maryland, to proceed with the construction of the ballroom where the East Wing once stood .  But officials said the commission has jurisdiction only when “vertical” construction begins, and does not oversee demolition.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently appointed White House staff secretary and loyalist Will Scharf to chair the National Capital Planning Commission, and tapped two other aides to serve on the body. Scharf said during a commission meeting last month that the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  Certain laws and rules regarding building alterations appear not to apply to the White House. The Shipstead-Luce Act of 1930 requires that alterations to buildings in specific areas of the nation’s capital must be presented to the Commission of Fine Arts. The language, however, refers to buildings facing the White House and not the White House itself.\n \n\n   \n  The planned ballroom is just one example of the president bringing his real estate developer roots to the capital. As CNN has previously reported, Trump is considering building a permanent arch in Washington, DC, as part of broader celebrations honoring the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in July. He also  signed  an executive order mandating that all federal buildings embrace classical architecture and discouraging brutalist-style buildings.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/florida-execution-norman-grim","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"18:36:00Z","title":"Florida Man Executed for 1998 Rape and Murder of Neighbor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Norman Mearle Grim Jr., a 65-year-old Florida man, was executed on October 28, 2025, for the 1998 rape and murder of his neighbor Cynthia Campbell, whose body was discovered near the Pensacola Bay Bridge.

a community member. He’s now facing deportation \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:27 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 38-year-old man who has been protected under  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program  for the past 12 years was detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this month, with the agency citing his social media posts as the reason for terminating his DACA status.\n \n\n   \n  Yaa’kub Ira Vijandre, whose legal name is Jacob Ira Azurin Vijandre, is a Filipino immigrant, freelance journalist and activist in the Dallas area who   was detained October 7, 2025, while leaving his home for work.\n \n\n   \n  Vijandre is one of several immigrants who have been detained this year after speaking out against the war in Gaza, including students  Mahmoud Khalil  and  Rümeysa Öztürk , and  British commentator Sami Hamdi , who was detained over the weekend while on a speaking tour.   \n \n\n   \n  In addition to opposing the war in Gaza, Vijandre also spoke out against human rights abuses at ICE facilities and “the US government’s inhumane and illegal treatment of those it accuses of terrorism,” his attorneys  said in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  His detention   came a day after he recorded and participated in a local city council meeting in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, Texas, where he gave vocal support for a local community leader who was detained by ICE, according to a court filing from his legal team Monday.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys filed  a habeas corpus petition  Monday, arguing their client is being unlawfully detained and asking the court for his release.\n \n\n   \n  Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing. Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age   14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says. He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement shared with CNN Monday that Vijandre posted content on his social media “glorifying terrorism,” and said he supported groups such as the Holy Land Foundation, a former US-based Muslim charity  where five members were convicted  in a contested series of trials on charges of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s filing denies Vijandre   has supported terrorism, and argues his   First and Fifth amendment rights have been violated and the court should order his release and provide injunctive relief to prevent “further unlawful detention.”\n \n\n   \n  One First Amendment expert warned that — though he said his knowledge of the details in this case was limited — the administration’s actions could have far-reaching implications.\n \n\n   \n  “When individuals, whether they’re citizens or not, are physically detained only because of political opinions they’ve expressed, it runs the very serious risk of eroding First Amendment rights for everybody,” David Snyder, the Executive Director at the First Amendment Coalition, a non-profit dedicated to promoting and protecting freedom of expression and the press, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Speech is “plainly protected by the First Amendment”\n \n\n   \n  On the morning of October 7, Vijandre was leaving his home in Arlington, Texas, when ICE agents arrested him while at least one officer pointed a handgun at him, Monday’s filing said.\n \n\n   \n  A Notice of Intent to Terminate DACA dated September 22 was sent   to Vijandre and   found in his mailbox several days after he was detained by ICE, according to the filing.\n \n\n   \n  The notice alleges Vijandre supported “organizations and individuals who are known to engage in acts of terrorism,” which “presents public safety, national security concerns, and is a significant negative discretionary factor under the totality of the circumstances analysis,” Monday’s habeas filing said.\n \n\n   \n  His legal team argues DHS is conflating supporting terrorism with Vijandre’s “opposition to U.S. foreign policy, the policies of the Israeli government, and abuse of prisoners with support for terrorism,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  “In each of the three cases listed above, what Respondents characterize as support for terrorism actually consists of opposing perceived violation of detainee rights, including at black site prisons like Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Force Base,” the habeas petition says. “Equating such speech to ‘terrorism’ to justify detention would risk criminalizing a broad array of protected speech critical of U.S. government policy engaged in by citizens and non-citizens alike.”\n \n\n   \n  Even if the speech did support terrorism, “such speech is plainly protected by the First Amendment,” the filing says, and the speech referenced by DHS “unquestionably fails this test regardless of whatever grounds of removability Respondents ultimately charge Mr. Vijandre in his Notice to Appear.”\n \n\n   \n  Vijandre is not charged or convicted of any crime, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Attempted recruitment by FBI\n \n\n   \n  His detention   also comes after he was approached by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and asked to act as a confidential informant shortly after the Israel-Gaza conflict started in 2023, the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  On or around November 30, 2023, agents approached Vijandre, indicating they wanted to recruit him as a confidential informant, and allegedly said he was “a poster child for the way you’re supposed to do it” in an apparent reference to immigration status, the filing says. He declined the offer, according to the filing.\n \n\n   \n  A form called a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien provided to Vijandre’s attorneys said that he was a “subject of interest to the [FBI’s] Dallas Join (sic) Terrorism Task Force” at an unspecified time, and the FBI initiated a review of his immigration record, the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  His team alleges that his detention is, in part,   retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.\n \n\n   \n    Vijandre’s attorneys ring alarm bells\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys representing Vijandre raised alarm bells   about the implications of their client’s detention, saying in Monday’s filing that “important democratic principles are at stake.”\n \n\n   \n  This is another example in a string of cases this year in which   the Trump administration is aiming to root out any immigrants it views as unpatriotic, and specifically associate those who are pro-Palestinian as being anti-American, said Marium Uddin, an attorney representing Vijandre and Legal Director of the Muslim Legal Fund of America.\n \n\n   \n  They appear to target people expressing dissent, which is disturbing from a legal perspective but also “incredibly scary as a country,” she said, adding that is testing whether our legal systems will stay intact and follow decades of legal precedent.\n \n\n   \n  The legal team is confident based on their review, and believe the Trump administration is looking to expand the definition of domestic terrorism despite their client’s protected speech about   things like ICE enforcement and inhumane detention at places like Guantanamo Bay ,  said attorney Eric Lee.\n \n\n   \n    Detention could be a “frightening violation” of first amendment, attorney says\n \n\n   \n  If Vijandre’s detention   is based purely on his criticism of the government, it could be “a frightening violation of the First Amendment’s protection,” said Snyder of First Amendment Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  He emphasized he doesn’t have all the details in the case as he is not representing Vijandre, but said first and foremost the First Amendment exists to protect “our ability to criticize what the government is doing or not doing.”\n \n\n   \n  This applies to citizen and non-citizens who are on American soil, no matter how long they’ve been present in the country, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really at the core of why the First Amendment is there, and if what the Trump administration is doing is putting people behind bars, even if only temporarily, because they disagree with their political expression, that’s hugely problematic,” Snyder said.\n \n\n   \n  Speech may not be protected if someone is inciting or directing others to incite violence — and that legal standard requires specific elements such as how specific a threat is, how likely it is to be carried out, and physical proximity to the person or thing being threatened, among other items, Snyder said.\n \n\n   \n  Vijandre’s legal team meticulously analyzed his social media presence and believe the government has failed to come close to satisfying imminent incitement, said Lee.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the facts regarding this case are still unfolding, the implications could be grave, Snyder said.\n \n\n   \n  “If the government establishes that they’re just going to come round you up, take you off the street if you say things that the government disapproves of, and that is the only basis for them taking you off the street, it has a tremendous chilling effect,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very dangerous for the government to behave this way,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/media/cnn-all-access-questions-answers-explainer-faq","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"19:01:00Z","title":"CNN has a new way to watch — here’s what you need to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CNN has launched All Access, a new digital streaming subscription service that allows users to stream live newscasts, access a vast library of video content, and watch original programming such as 'The Enten Scale' and 'Devoted'.

here’s what you need to know \n       \n  By Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  You may have noticed some changes around here. CNN’s family of websites and apps now features All Access, a new way to subscribe and stream CNN, complete with new types of news content for those subscribers.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a big pivot for CNN in an era of direct-to-consumer relationships and mobile-first news reports, as I wrote  here .\n \n\n   \n  It’s definitely a lot to take in. And you probably have some questions. So I wanted to help! I write the  Reliable Sources newsletter  for CNN, so I asked readers what they wanted to know about All Access, and interviewed the network’s top executives to get answers.\n \n\n   \n  ——\n \n\n   \n   Rhoda asked: “What is it? How does it work?” \n \n\n   \n  All Access is a new way to stream CNN’s news coverage. It is built into CNN’s websites and apps. When you sign up, you can stream live newscasts and access a wide array of videos and other news coverage. “We’re making CNN available on all of our platforms,” said Alex MacCallum, CNN’s executive vice president for digital products and services.\n \n\n   \n   Carole asked: “What is the cost?” \n \n\n   \n  All Access costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. CNN is enticing users to pay annually by offering an intro price of $41.99 for the first year. News outlets of all sizes are moving toward digital subscription models to make their newsrooms sustainable.\n \n\n   \n   Keith asked: “Who’s the All Access product actually for?” \n \n\n   \n  MacCallum said market research has identified several audience segments, including cord-cutters who no longer have cable but still want access to CNN’s TV channels, and CNN superfans who want the fullest possible experience. The service is designed to be mobile-first. “We’re meeting our audiences where they are now,” CNN CEO Mark Thompson said.\n \n\n   \n   Marcus asked: “I already subscribed to CNN.com last year. What happens to that?” \n \n\n   \n  Last year’s $3.99-per-month digital paywall, which gives unlimited access to CNN articles, is now called the Basic tier, while All Access adds live streams and CNN’s library of shows, plus everything in Basic.\n \n\n   \n   Janet asked: “So if I have cable, will I still get the regular old CNN?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes. CNN’s long-term distribution deals with cable and satellite providers are still in effect. And CNN’s TV schedule is not changing.\n \n\n   \n   Jack asked: “My cable includes CNN. Can that leverage to an online subscription? Or do I have to pony up again?” \n \n\n   \n  You can log in, or “authenticate,” with your cable username and password to stream All Access wherever you want. You’ll only have to pony up if you want unlimited access to CNN articles, i.e., the Basic tier.\n \n\n   \n   Jim asked: “Will CNN All Access be available on TV streaming, like Roku or Amazon Fire?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes. You can download CNN’s app through Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Android TV, Apple TV, LG TV and Samsung TV. (The All Access content is currently unavailable on Samsung TVs.)\n \n\n   \n   Marcy asked: “Will there be a complete list of what is included and what is not?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes,  here  is a handy graphic of the CNN stream schedule. In general, all of the CNN US newscasts air from morning until night, with a handful of hours replaced by shows from CNN International and CNN Headlines, and with primetime replaying overnight.\n \n\n   \n   Allan asked: “Will there be any new interactive features to integrate audience participation into your products?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes. For example, Anderson Cooper will host “All There Is Live,” a weekly companion stream to his popular “All There Is” podcast, where he’ll react to viewers’ real-time comments during the live show.\n \n\n   \n   Jerome: “Will there be any content exclusive to All Access that you won’t be able to access if you use an existing cable login? Will there be any new digital exclusive shows?” \n \n\n   \n  There are brand new shows, yes, like “ The Enten Scale ” with Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten and “ Devoted ” from Senior Correspondent Donie O’Sullivan. I authenticated with my cable username and password, and I was able to access all the new content.\n \n\n   \n   Jon asked: “Will CNN original programming like Tony Shalhoub’s show be available?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes, on a next-day basis, meaning CNN Original Series and CNN Films will be added to the streaming library the day after their TV premieres. More than a thousand hours from the network’s library are also included in All Access.\n \n\n   \n   Harry: “Will there be any changes to content on CNN Max — currently available to HBO Max subscribers?” \n \n\n   \n  The CNN live stream will leave HBO Max in the US on November 17 as CNN prioritizes the All Access service. A library of CNN Original Series and CNN Films will still be available on HBO Max after that date.\n \n\n   \n   Geneviève asked: “Any idea on when it will be available in Canada?” \n \n\n   \n  Not yet. All Access is available in the US, and company executives say they intend to expand to other parts of the world over time.\n \n\n   \n  ——\n \n\n   \n  If you have a question that isn’t covered here,  check the CNN Help Center .

Here’s what you need to know \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Bill Kirkos, Andy Rose, Rebekah Riess, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Top Border Patrol chief  Gregory Bovino , who oversees the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, came under the microscope of a federal judge Tuesday after she received reports federal agents were not following her order to  limit aggressive tactics  and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis told Bovino she wants to see him in person every evening for the next week so he can update her on “Operation Midway Blitz” and whether his agents are complying with her order.\n \n\n   \n  The controversial immigration operation has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  But it has also drawn legal challenges from plaintiffs that include protesters, local journalists and clergy members who accuse federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators and unlawfully restricting the press.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis summoned Bovino to testify Tuesday after plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has refuted.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n    Judge allows limited tear gas use, despite concerns of overuse\n \n\n   \n  Even as she expressed concern that agents may not be complying with her order, Ellis declined to fully restrict their use of tear gas, as the plaintiffs had asked her to do.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to tie the agents’ hands because I’m not out there, and that’s not my job,” Ellis said. “But I am going to expect that they know and understand their responsibilities on the use of force.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on protesters unless there is an “immediate threat to safety.” It also requires clear warnings before these methods are used.\n \n\n   \n  During the hearing, the judge went through her order line by line and detailed how agents should comply, including clearly identifying themselves and providing ample warning before deploying gas.\n \n\n   \n  “The warning has to include what it is that you’re going to do, what you’re going to do before you do it, and allow people to comply,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge cited videos that she said appeared to show agents firing gas without notice and with no immediate threat.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino declined to comment on specific instances, saying, “Each situation is dependent on the situation.” But Ellis noted he’s likely to be asked about recent alleged violations of her order during a deposition she’s allowing plaintiff’s attorneys to conduct of him in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis ordered that all use-of-force reports for Operation Midway Blitz from September 2 through last Satur﻿day, along with any body camera footage taken during those interactions, be turned over to the court under seal by the end of this week.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for next week.\n \n\n   \n    Body cameras ‘are your friends’ – but Bovino doesn’t have one\n \n\n   \n  As the Trump administration and protesters provide starkly different pictures of the reality on the ground, Ellis emphasized the importance of agents wearing body cameras to document their interactions with protesters, saying it could actually benefit agents who claim they are being attacked by crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “Cameras are your friends. If you are conducting enforcement activities in the street, and there is a threat, the body-worn camera is going to pick that up. All I have to do is look at the video,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  But Bovino admitted that while the “vast majority” of his agents wear body cameras, he does not wear one himself, even though he participates in operations that fall under the judge’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Ellis told federal officials that agents must wear body cameras and turn them on when interacting with protesters in Chicago. Days later, a Customs and Border Protection commander told Ellis every agent on duty was equipped with a body camera.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like you to do your best to ensure everybody who is under this Midway Blitz operation that they all have body-worn cameras,” Ellis said Tuesday. Bovino told the judge he would work to get a camera for himself by Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the hearing, Ellis said videos she had seen did not show justification for use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s difficult for me to see that the force being used is necessary to stop an immediate and serious threat of harm to a person,” Ellis told Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs allege Bovino can be seen in an October 23  video  throwing a tear gas canister into a crowd. The Department of Homeland Security  said  Bovino was hit in the head beforehand, but that was not visible in publicly released  videos .\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed video released by DHS on Tuesday, which shows at least one object thrown near Bovino. It also shows at least a couple of people throwing objects. The video does not appear to show Bovino being struck in the head by an object.\n \n\n   \n  In an online  post , the agency said, “Border Patrol agents repeated multiple warnings to back up and that chemical agents would be deployed if warnings were ignored. Riot control measures were deployed, including by Chief Bovino, and arrests were made.”\n \n\n   \n    A community’s sense of safety is ‘shattered,’ judge says\n \n\n   \n  Aggressive dispersal tactics and angry clashes between agents and demonstrators do not occur in isolation, Ellis said, and the judge called Tuesday’s hearing in part to ensure residents can live safely while immigration enforcement takes place.\n \n\n   \n  “Folks on the sidewalks, on the streets, if they’re in a public place that they’re lawfully allowed to be, can be there unless we’ve got exigent circumstances,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis seemed to reference a  reported  tear-gassing incident in the Old Irving Park neighborhood Saturday as a children’s Halloween parade was getting underway, saying the event “shattered their sense of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  “Kids dressed in Halloween costumes walking to a parade do not pose an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer or others. They just don’t,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  She said she hoped children in Little Village, the neighborhood where Bovino is accused of gassing protesters, “can feel safe walking to the store or walking to school and not worry about being tear-gassed and not be terrified where they live.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not how any of us want to live,” the judge added.\n \n\n   \n  She said her order and Tuesday’s hearing was intended to ensure Bovino and his agents enforce the law in a way that is “objectionably reasonable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/weather/cuba-hurricane-melissa-what-to-expect","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"17:33:00Z","title":"Cuba is staring down a direct hit from Melissa.

Among the dead are four Brazilian police officers, officials added.\n \n\n   \n  Rio de Janeiro State Governor Cláudio Castro told reporters at a press conference that police confiscated a “large quantity of drugs” in the raid, according to Reuters. Authorities also claimed on social media that  at least 42 rifles  were seized during the operation.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post on X  on Tuesday afternoon, Castro pronounced the raid “the biggest operation in the history of Rio de Janeiro.”\n \n\n   \n  Police raids are common in the city before international events, and next week, Rio will host a major climate conference, the  C40 World Mayors Summit .\n \n\n   \n  Video published by Reuters on Tuesday showed huge columns of black smoke emerging from the Alemão favela during the raid. Photographs of Alemão in the aftermath showed the source: burned cars, constructed as barricades.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities launched an operation aiming to “combat the territorial expansion” of the Comando Vermelho criminal group, Rio de Janeiro’s government added in a lengthy thread on X.\n \n\n   \n  The operation was in the works for over a year, the government said, and involved   more than 2,500 military and civilian police personnel.\n \n\n   \n  Comando Vermelho is Brazil’s oldest active criminal organization, according to the  think tank InSight Crime . Its name, Portuguese for “Red Command,” is a reference to its origins as a leftist prisoners’ organization formed during the military dictatorship that ruled over Brazil until 1985.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Red Command has become a massive, transnational criminal group, involved in drug trafficking and extortion.

It is unanimously thought to be an agonizingly detailed reflection on her whirlwind marriage to and apparently grisly breakup with her estranged husband, “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to representatives for both Allen and Harbour for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from brandishing her trademark courage to be fundamentally vulnerable, hurt and pissed (in the American sense) on the record, Allen  really   goes there  in the seventh track, titled “Pussy Palace.”\n \n\n   \n  The song, and the album as a whole, notably doesn’t namecheck Harbour. But it does recount a time after Allen and a partner fought — and in the song, she brings   some personal effects to his apartment since she doesn’t want him in her bed.\n \n\n   \n  Upon arriving, she realizes “something don’t feel right,” as she sings, because the space she had previously thought was her partner’s “dojo” was actually his … insert NSFW title of song here.\n \n\n   \n  “So am I looking at a sex addict?” she asks in the chorus, before launching into an extremely confessional second verse that describes a “shoebox full of handwritten letters, from broken-hearted women wishing you could have been better.”\n \n\n   \n  After detailing a messy scene with “sheets pulled off the bed, they’re strewn all on the floor, long black hair, probably from the night before,” Allen sings about a  now-infamous “Duane Reade bag”  with tied handles that’s full of unmentionable intimate objects along with “hundreds of Trojans.”\n \n\n   \n  Allen is here to remind us that when it comes to artistic expression, there really is no such thing as oversharing.\n \n\n   \n  On a simplistic level, the album “West End Girl” feels like an update to Morissette’s jaggedly confessional breakup anthem “You Oughta Know” from exactly three decades ago. This is all light years away from Carly Simon’s mother-of-all-relationship-burns “You’re So Vain” in terms of burn factor, mixing the rawness of an Apple postmortem with the good ol’ resignation of Carole King’s “It’s Too Late.”\n \n\n   \n  As with the breakup music that came before, Allen’s is a reminder that art is at once pain and healing. Her sharing every emotional stop on what we’re led to believe is a train wreck of a separation becomes, in expert hands, a peek into what are extremely relatable moments.\n \n\n   \n  Like, raise your hand if you’ve ever been on either side of the situation she depicts in the song “Tennis,” in which Allen sings of a partner who is protecting the things on his phone he doesn’t want her to see — “then you showed me a photo on Instagram / it was how you grabbed your phone back right out of my hands.”\n \n\n   \n  Look, relationships are hard. But maybe what isn’t so hard for artists like Allen and Swift? Laying it all out on the table, warts and all, for listeners to pick apart and, yes, be totally shocked over.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/tech/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-wikipedia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"16:05:00-04:00","title":"Elon Musk Launches His Version of Wikipedia","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk launched Grokipedia, an AI-generated alternative to Wikipedia, on October 28, 2025, asserting that it offers a more truthful and unbiased version of information.

Wikipedia’s article begins with describing Floyd as a man “murdered by a white police officer.” Grokipedia’s entry on Floyd focuses on the drugs in Floyd’s system during his death, which was ruled a homicide by a medical examiner.\n \n\n   \n  In another example of Grokipedia citing sources that do not seem to reference what Grokipedia writes, the article about Floyd describes the nationwide protests after his death as “extensive civil unrest … including riots causing billions in property damage.” But the section cites an  obituary  in the Texas State Historical Association website that does not make any such claims.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment about these discrepancies, xAI’s media email now automatically replied with “Legacy Media Lies.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk has said Grokipedia will be continuously updated.  “As Grok improves, so will Grokipedia,” he wrote on X on Tuesday. “We are embedding the principles of critical thinking and cogency into Grok.”\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-mike-johnson-shutdown-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"16:02:00Z","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene vents frustration over shutdown strategy at Speaker Johnson on private call with House Republicans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a private call with House Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for keeping the House out of session during a government shutdown, asserting that leadership is out of touch with public needs and demanding a clear Republican healthcare plan to replace Obamacare.

October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia went back and forth during a private call with House Republicans on Tuesday, according to two sources on the call, as tensions rise during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, who has been publicly critical of Johnson’s decision to keep the House out of session, took her criticism directly to the speaker and said he is not in touch with what people want, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson responded by saying it was not helpful to shoot inside the Republican tent, argued the shutdown was Democrats’ fault, and said President Donald Trump’s poll numbers are rising, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  A clearly frustrated Greene was “forceful” as she vented her criticism, which was directed at GOP leaders for keeping the House out of session during the shutdown, according to another source on the call. Johnson, in his response, was “calm” in his defense of the party’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  The Louisiana Republican also told members the shutdown pain was about to rise to a level “10,” referring to the millions of Americans who could lose food assistance in the coming weeks, as well as disrupted air travel and missed paychecks for federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Dan Crenshaw of Texas also voiced frustration with the House not being in session, the source on the call said.\n \n\n   \n  The criticism comes after weeks of inaction from the House, with lawmakers riding out the shutdown from their districts after passing an initial funding bill in late September. As consequences from the shutdown have rippled through more Americans’ lives, tensions have been rising in the House GOP conference, with some — like Greene and Kiley — demanding a clearer plan from leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Most in the conference remain in lockstep behind Johnson, arguing that the House cannot return to Washington until Democrats agree to reopen the government. Yet the strain on the GOP is evident — even among leadership loyalists — as the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Greene later  posted on X  in response to a report on the private call, saying, “You left out that I said I have no respect for the House not being in session passing our bills and the President’s executive orders. And I demanded to know from Speaker Johnson what the Republican plan for healthcare is to build the off-ramp off Obamacare and the ACA tax credits to make health insurance affordable for Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are calling for Republicans to negotiate with them an extension of expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, but Republican leaders have said the government must be reopened first before any negotiation.\n \n\n   \n  She added, “Johnson said he’s got ideas and pages of policy ideas and committees of jurisdiction are working on it, but he refused to give one policy proposal to our GOP conference on our own conference call. Apparently I have to go into a SCIF to find out the Republican healthcare plan!!!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/ed-martin-biden-pardons-house-oversights","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00Z","title":"Justice Department Attorney Ed Martin’s Email on Biden-Era Pardons Exposes Alleged Abuse of AutoPen Process","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Justice Department Pardon Attorney Ed Martin has issued a public statement revealing serious concerns about the Biden administration’s use of the AutoPen to issue pardons and commutations, alleging that political actors exploited the process to advance personal or ideological agendas.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, a day before the House Oversight Committee  released a 93-page report  outlining its conclusions from its monthslong investigation into former President Joe Biden’s use of the autopen to formalize clemency decisions, Justice Department official Ed Martin wrote an email to its chair.\n \n\n   \n  Martin, the pardon attorney, told GOP Rep. James Comer that his “ongoing investigation” of the way that pardons and commutations were issued during Biden’s presidency had revealed “abuses” of the process by “political actors.” He wrote that his office would not defend any of the acts of clemency “without further investigation” – though there is no mechanism or precedent to reverse a pardon issued by a past president.\n \n\n   \n  CNN obtained a copy of the email. Here it is in full.\n \n\n   \n   Dear Chairman Comer, \n \n\n   \n   Good to talk to your staff today about this very important matter. \n \n\n   \n   As I mentioned on the phone, since we met in your office last June, I have been working on understanding the circumstances and facts that surround the unprecedented pardons and commutations of the President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration. \n \n\n   \n   My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staft and perhaps others is troubling. \n \n\n   \n   As an attorney, I am very aware that the power of the pardon rests with the President and that I am called to act on his behalf and within his power. I am not able in any way to act on my own behalf, and to bind him to any commutation or pardon. No other staffer may do so. \n \n\n   \n   To be clear: All Executive power is vested in a duly elected and President. The highest functions of that Office-including the pardon power-are non-delegable. This is at once profound and common sense—it provides a clear line of democratic accountability between decisions and consequences. \n \n\n   \n   What I am seeing in my investigation of the Biden pardons is disturbing. Not only were there regularities but questions of confidence in the system and competence of the participants. \n \n\n   \n   The Constitution only works if the President is competent. The 25th Amendment was adopted after historical failures such as President Woodrow Wilson’s incapacity and the shock of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination to ensure our Nation never had an incompetent Chief Executive again. \n \n\n   \n   That Amendment ultimately relies upon those it charged with monitoring the competency of the President doing that right thing and upholding their oaths. The Biden Administration broke this system down, when they hid the truth of the president’s health from the American people \n \n\n   \n   By accounts and now public admissions, President Biden did not appear competent, and all available evidence indicates that those charged under the 25th Amendment did not protect the Country, because the individuals charged with executing the Amendment’s intent failed. Instead, they seem to have protected themselves and President Biden by covering up President Biden’s incapacity. The abuses carried in connection with my office provide further evidence on this front, which certainly suggest that bad actors exploited President Biden’s infirmary to secure their own agenda by, with, and through various means including the AutoPen. \n \n\n   \n   As the Pardon Attorney, I can tell you unequivocally that my Office cannot support the validity and ongoing legal effect of pardons and commutations issued during the Biden Administration without further examination. \n \n\n   \n   Their validity must be fully examined in light of what we now know - and I suspect ultimately by a Court with a presentation of the evidence you and others have gathered. \n \n\n   \n   In August, I released an internal email in my possession from former Deputy Attorney General Brad Weinsheimer that is emblematic of the problems in the former administration’s commutation process. The e-mail was sent the Saturday morning after the White House announced sweeping commutations of thousands of so-called “non-violent” felons the day prior. Weinsheimer correctly noted that the list of individuals whose sentences were supposedly commuted contained seriously violent offenders. He requested clarification directly from the President as to the clear conflict between the White House’s statements and the names put forward as somehow fitting into the category of the commutation. \n \n\n   \n   In a New York Times article a month prior to my release of that particular e-mail, former President Biden disclosed that “he did not individually approve each name for categorical pardons that applied to large numbers of people.” This alone seems to raise serious questions of whether those commutations are invalid. After all, only the President has the power to issue pardons or commutations. Setting aside other evidence regarding former President Biden’s incapacity, his statement seems an admission that the commutations to which Mr. Weinsheimer took issue were not valid commutations in the first place, notwithstanding their other defects. \n \n\n   \n   Other defects apply to the pardon process for several other high-profile pardons towards the end of the Biden Administration. My office cannot support the validity of AutoPen pardons for individuals such as Anthony Fauci, Adam Schiff, Mark Milley, and many more without further examination and fact-finding. In my tenure here, I have not seen any evidence supporting the theory that President Biden was personally aware and authorized these AutoPen’d pardons. \n \n\n   \n   If these pardons or commutations are challenged in any way, I recognize serious difficulties in defending them. \n \n\n   \n   I greatly appreciate the work of Congress and your Committee in particular in conducting vigorous oversight into AutoPen abuses and its connections to pardons and commutations. \n \n\n   \n   While it is unfortunate that such work is necessary, Americans now have a fuller accounting of the constitutional breakdown in their system of government. It is that broken trust that I as Pardon Attorney am committed to restoring. That work must involve accountability for official actions in violation of law. It will also involve recommitting my office to ensure that proper procedures are in place to ensure that only constitutional actions are effectuated through my office. No longer will we tolerate government by AutoPen. \n \n\n   \n   Please let this letter serve as official recognition that I, as Pardon Attorney, recognize the grave abuses in the pardon and commutation process of the last Administration. My office stands ready to work with you to ensure these abuses never occur again. Sorry for this long email but I believe my follow up to our June meeting was deserved and late - for you so apologize. \n \n\n   \n   All the best. \n \n\n   \n   Ed Martin \n \n\n   \n   U.S. Pardon Attorney \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/biden-autopen-investigation-house-oversight-final-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"06:26:00-20:00","title":"GOP-led Oversight Committee says Biden pardons signed by autopen are ‘void’ in final report","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has released a 93-page report declaring that all executive actions signed by President Joe Biden via autopen are 'void' due to concerns over cognitive decline and a lack of documented, contemporaneous approval from Biden himself.

 By Jake Tapper, Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President Joe Biden experienced such “cognitive decline” while in office that it remains a serious question as to whether he was aware of the substance of the various pardons and commutations signed in his name  via autopen , the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee asserted in a letter it sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging her to consider whether that clemency might be invalid and to take action for potential prosecution against some of Biden’s aides.\n \n\n   \n  The committee “deems void President Biden’s executive actions that were signed using the Autopen, and the committee determines that action by the Department of Justice is warranted to address the legal consequences of that determination,” it wrote to Bondi in the letter released Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The letter was made public alongside a 93-page report outlining the committee’s conclusions from its months-long investigation into Biden’s use of the autopen. It alleged the committee had found “a cover-up of the president’s cognitive decline” and “no record demonstrating President Biden himself made all of the executive decisions that were attributed to him.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has publicly disputed that, saying he made all decisions as president and calling Republicans who have suggested otherwise “liars.”\n \n\n   \n  To support its assertions, the committee report includes excerpts of interviews with 14 former senior Biden aides, and it released transcripts and video later Tuesday morning. Although the committee raised serious questions about the Biden administration’s process for awarding pardons, it did not cite any direct evidence that anyone other than Biden made the decisions that his staff later put into effect. Instead, the committee pointed to a lack of clear records indicating that Biden was the decision-maker. The panel did not subpoena Biden to testify in the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia, the ranking member on the House Oversight committee, called the report a “sham investigation” in a statement, adding that “every White House official testified President Biden fully executed his duties as President of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  “The testimonies also make it clear the former President authorized every executive order, pardon, and use of the autopen,” Garcia said while calling on House Republicans to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  In their interviews, Biden aides defended the process they had in place for using the autopen and stated firmly that Biden made his own decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have long raised questions about Biden’s mental state, but in releasing the report, the GOP-led committee seemed to suggest a path for continued impacts of its work.\n \n\n   \n  The letter specifically asked that the Justice Department further investigate three top Biden White House aides who  invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify  to the committee: former White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor, and Biden aides Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini.\n \n\n   \n  Invoking the Fifth Amendment is typically done to avoid answering specific questions. Though it can be perceived by the public as a way of avoiding accountability, the US Supreme Court has long regarded the right against self-incrimination as a venerable part of the Constitution and, in legal proceedings, tried to ensure that a witness’ silence not be viewed as evidence of guilt.\n \n\n   \n  The Committee also wrote to the Board of Medicine for Washington, DC, requesting that it investigate whether O’Connor should be disciplined in any manner for “issuing misleading medical reports, misrepresenting treatments, failing to conform to standards of practice, or other acts of violation of District of Columbia law regulating licensed physicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Former Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients  told the committee  that after Biden’s disastrous debate performance last year, he recommended O’Connor conduct a full medical workup, including a cognitive exam, and O’Connor said he would take the suggestion under advisement.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to O’Connor, Bernal, Tomasini, Zients, and former staffer Bruce Reed. A Biden spokesperson said, “This investigation into baseless claims has confirmed what has been clear from the start: President Biden made the decisions of his presidency.”\n \n\n   \n  “There was no conspiracy, no cover-up, and no wrongdoing. Congressional Republicans should stop focusing on political retribution and instead work to end the government shutdown,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The book “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” co-authored by CNN’s Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, documented how Biden, his closest aides and his family forged ahead with the former president’s doomed 2024 reelection bid despite signs of his physical and mental decline.\n \n\n   \n  “Our report reveals how key aides colluded to mislead the public and the extraordinary measures they took to sustain the appearance of presidential authority as Biden’s capacity to function independently diminished. Executive actions performed by Biden White House staff and signed by autopen are null and void,” said Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, the committee’s chairman, said in a statement that called for accountability.\n \n\n   \n  The committee’s assertion that Bondi seek to act on their declaration of Biden’s actions as “void” suggested they were exploring legal ways to undo his grants of clemency. Such a move would likely face significant legal challenges; there is no mechanism or precedent to reverse a pardon issued by a past president, legal experts say. In 2005, during the second Bush administration, the Justice Department looked at the legality of a president’s use of the autopen and endorsed it – so long as the decision came from the president.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump administration officials appeared to be contemplating a world in which the pardons would be invalidated. In a  Monday email CNN obtained from a source , the Trump-installed Pardon Attorney at the Justice Department,  Ed Martin , told Comer that his “ongoing investigation” of the way that pardons and commutations were issued during Biden’s presidency had revealed “abuses” of the process by “political actors.” He wrote that his office would not defend any of the acts of clemency “without further investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “My office cannot support the validity of AutoPen pardons for individuals such as Anthony Fauci, Adam Schiff, Mark Milley, and many more without further examination and fact-finding,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X, Bondi said her team was “reviewing the Biden administration’s reported use of autopen for pardons,” and that she looked forward to working alongside the Oversight Committee “to deliver accountability for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Even before the committee’s action, the Justice Department and the White House had been looking into Biden’s use of the autopen, which had long been a fixation of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  reported in May  that Martin, who also heads the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group to look into whether alleged efforts by the previous administrations to improperly use the levers of government, had been examining Biden’s past pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In June,  Trump issued an executive order  instructing Bondi and the White House counsel to conduct “an investigation into who ran the United States while President Biden was in office,” as well as Biden’s use of an autopen for important orders. That probe was to include “who authorized its use, and the validity of the resulting Presidential policy decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  The Biden camp responded to the executive order with a written statement calling Trump’s assertions “ridiculous and false.” “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n   Biden then spoke to New York Times reporters  on the phone, telling the newspaper in a 10-minute interview that he “made every decision” and pardoned people proactively so they would not face costly Justice Department investigations when Trump took over.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody knows how vindictive he is, so we knew that they’d do what they’re doing now,” Biden told The Times at the time, adding, “I consciously made all those decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  As president, Biden issued pardons and commutations to 4,245 people – more acts of clemency than any other president. Perhaps most controversially, he preemptively pardoned prominent Trump critics and members of his own family, including his son who was convicted of federal tax-related charges, fearing they might be targeted for retribution when Trump took office for a second time.\n \n\n   \n  “These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,” Biden wrote at the time in a statement about the initial batch of pardons, issued hours before he was set to welcome Trump to the White House for tea before attending his swearing-in. “Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety and financial security of targeted individuals and their families.”\n \n\n   \n    A focus on Biden’s pardon process\n \n\n   \n  The final section of the report sought to outline issues with Biden’s use of the autopen.\n \n\n   \n  While former staffers like Reed said the Biden administration’s practice for pardons was like “the prior two administrations” for whom he served, the House Oversight Committee raised questions about how the pardons were implemented.\n \n\n   \n  The committee focused specifically on the lack of documentation around a key in-person meeting where the pardons for Biden’s family, Dr. Anthony Fauci, General Mark Milley and members of the January 6 Committee were allegedly finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons were conveyed by a “game of telephone,” the committee said. The report noted Biden’s decision was conveyed by Reed and White House Counsel Ed Siskel to Rosa Po, an aide to White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. From there, Po called Zients, Zients authorized Po to send an email authorizing the use of autopen to sign the pardons, and Po sent the email to the staff secretary’s office, who then told someone to use the autopen for pardons.\n \n\n   \n  “In light of the former president’s cognitive deterioration and the cover-up from his inner circle, this ‘approval’ process calls into question the validity of all pardons reportedly granted by President Biden throughout his tenure,” the committee stated, deeming “void” every executive action signed by the Joe Biden autopen “without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president’s own consent.”\n \n\n   \n  The panel’s final report highlighted former Biden White House staffers’ testimony in which they expressed degrees of confusion about the decision-making process.\n \n\n   \n  Former White House Staff Secretary Neera Tanden, who was responsible for managing paper flow to the president, told committee investigators that she didn’t know what happened to the decision book between when she gave the materials to the Oval Office operations team and received it back with Biden’s signature, the report alleges. Zients said in another excerpt that he did not know who actually operated the autopen and shared that Hunter Biden did take part in some of the pardon discussions. And former White House chief of staff Ron Klain testified during one portion of his interview that Biden made some executive decisions “orally,” but the excerpt didn’t address whether that pertained to pardon decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “The Biden White House’s executive decision-making procedures were so lax that the chain of custody for a given decision is difficult or impossible to establish,” the panel wrote. “Documents that were used to predicate executive actions  should  be sufficiently traceable to ensure they reflect the will of the president. Instead, the Biden White House’s flimsy procedure appears to have been extremely vulnerable to abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  The aides, though, insisted to House Oversight investigators that Biden was making the calls. Tanden said there were never any executive orders auto-penned based solely on a senior advisor’s request. She said she never authorized the use of the autopen without a signature card from the former president.\n \n\n   \n  “I sometimes have a reputation for toughness, and I always require the signature card,” Tanden said, according to a transcript.\n \n\n   \n  Klain said, “We used the same process that I thought prior presidents had used.”\n \n\n   \n  And Zients emphasized that the picture that Republicans were trying to paint about the pardon process was not accurate.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want you to miss the rigor and the amount of iterations, the amount of time the president spent on pardons. He made these decisions, obviously, but he also made these decisions after, in most cases, many, many meetings,” Zients said.\n \n\n   \n   According to Pew Research,  96% of Biden’s acts of clemency were in the last three months and 20 days of his presidency. The then-president declared the commutations were going to “non violent” drug offenders, but according to Justice Department emails obtained by the committee, Justice Department ethics attorney Bradley Weinsheimer wrote to Biden White House staff: “I think you should stop saying that because it is untrue or at least misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  With little time to vet the list of those to receive commutation, Weinsheimer wrote that he and his team identified “19 that were highly problematic,” 16 of whom Biden granted clemency, including “violent offenders, including those who committed acts of violence during the offense of conviction, or who otherwise have a history of violence…” For example, Marvin Gabrion, whose death sentence Biden commuted in favor of a term of life in prison, was convicted of kidnapping and murdering 19-year-old Rachel Timmerman and her 11-month-old daughter two days before he was scheduled to be tried on rape charges.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea if the president was aware of these backgrounds when making clemency decisions,” Weinsheimer wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In his email to Comer suggesting he would not defend previous Biden pardons, Martin noted Weinsheimer’s message.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/golf-lpga-kai-trump-exemption","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"12:56:00-20:00","title":"President Trump’s Granddaughter Gets Exemption to LPGA Tournament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kai Trump, granddaughter of former President Donald Trump, will make her professional debut on the LPGA Tour at The Annika at Pelican Golf Club on November 13, 2025, after receiving a sponsor exemption.

what prosecutors described as “malicious comments” about her gender and sexuality.\n \n\n   \n  “There isn’t a single week when she isn’t harassed, not one person in her personal or professional life

    \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:55 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In an unprecedented situation, millions of Americans could  lose access  to a crucial food assistance program in the coming weeks amid the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture has said it does not have the money to pay $8 billion in food stamp benefits for November amid the funding impasse on Capitol Hill that led the government to shut down on October 1. The agency argues it cannot tap into its roughly  $6 billion contingency fund  to cover next month’s benefits, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates claim the USDA should — or is even obligated to — use the money.\n \n\n   \n  Without help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps, many recipients are going to have to decide whether to use their limited budgets to buy groceries, pay rent, fill prescriptions or turn on the heat, said Ed Bolen, director of state SNAP strategies for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “They are going to face an immense drop in their ability to put food on the table,” he said. “They’re going to skip meals. They’re going to substitute foods. They’re going to have to turn elsewhere.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the looming pause in SNAP benefits:\n \n\n   \n    When will food stamps be halted?\n \n\n   \n  Food stamps will not be issued for November. When beneficiaries will feel the impact varies since states typically provide the benefits on a rolling basis during the month. Some will miss their payments as soon as Saturday, November 1, while others won’t be hit until later in the month.\n \n\n   \n    How many people will be impacted? How many are senior citizens or children?\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million people — or about 1 in 8 Americans — received food stamps in May, according to the latest USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  Households with children, an elderly individual or a non-elderly person with a disability received 83% of SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2023, according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  About 39% of food stamp recipients were children, while 20% were elderly and 10% were non-elderly individuals with a disability.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive about $350 a month, on average, in SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The assistance doesn’t expire at the end of each month, but beneficiaries typically use all the funds in the month they receive them, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n \n\n   \n    Can states advance funds for SNAP if the federal government can’t pay?\n \n\n   \n  States don’t have enough money to cover $8 billion in monthly food stamp benefits, though several have said they will beef up their food assistance programs next month.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the USDA said it will not reimburse states if they try to cover the cost of the benefits temporarily.\n \n\n   \n    How will people get food for their families if benefits stop?\n \n\n   \n  Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good alternatives to food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Americans can turn to food pantries and other community food assistance programs, but these groups have been under pressure from rising food prices and increased need in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown adds another layer of strain to an already stretched emergency food system,” Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, the state association of food banks, said in a statement, noting that more than 3.5 million Texans receive food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Several states have said they will pour millions of dollars into their emergency food programs — but it will be far less than the typical federal outlays.\n \n\n   \n  In New York, for instance, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday that she is fast-tracking $30 million to support more than 16 million meals, in addition to the more than $11 million for local emergency food relief.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, in Minnesota, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday that his administration would funnel $4 million to the state’s food pantries. Meanwhile, South Carolina is  activating a statewide charity fund  typically used after hurricanes.\n \n\n   \n  And Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday that his state is  building its own food assistance system  for residents. The program will be funded through the state’s surplus and will cost an estimated roughly $37.5 million a week.\n \n\n   \n  Most states efforts won’t be able to fully replace the SNAP program. Bolen noted that New Yorkers received more than $647 million in food stamp benefits in May, while Minnesota residents were issued more than $71 million in SNAP.\n \n\n   \n    Will recipients receive November’s payment when the funding impasse ends?\n \n\n   \n  Experts believe November’s benefits will be issued at the end of the shutdown, but this is uncharted territory, so they cautioned they aren’t sure.\n \n\n   \n    What else are SNAP recipients and states contending with?\n \n\n   \n  Unrelated to the shutdown,  a key provision  of the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes effect on November 1. The GOP domestic agenda package expanded work requirements in the food stamp program to enrollees through age 64 and to parents of children ages 14 and older, among others.\n \n\n   \n  SNAP enrollees can receive benefits for only three months out of every 36 months unless they meet the work requirements, which include working, volunteering or participating in job training at least 80 hours a month.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michael Williams and Dianne Gallagher contributed to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/bill-gates-climate-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00-04:00","title":"Bill Gates Makes a Stunning Claim About Climate Change","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bill Gates, a prominent figure in global climate and development policy, has published an essay arguing that climate change will not result in human extinction and that global resources should be redirected from ambitious carbon reduction efforts to combating disease and hunger—particularly in the world’s poorest countries.

climate change \n       \n  By David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:36 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a stunning and significant pushback to the “doomsday” climate activist community, Bill Gates, a leading proponent for carbon emissions reductions, published a  remarkable essay  Tuesday that argued resources must be shifted away from the battle against climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Gates argues, the world’s philanthropists must increase their investment in other efforts aimed at preventing disease and hunger.\n \n\n   \n  Climate change is not going to wipe out humanity, he argued, and past efforts that strive for achieving zero carbon emissions have made real progress. But Gates said that past investments fighting climate change have been misplaced, and too much good money has been put into expensive and questionable efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Although Gates said investment to battle climate change must continue, he argued that President Donald Trump’s  cuts to USAID  threaten a more urgent problem, inflicting potentially lasting global damage to the fight against famine and life-threatening preventable sickness.\n \n\n   \n  “Climate change, disease, and poverty are all major problems,” Gates wrote. “We should deal with them in proportion to the suffering they cause.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s funding cuts, Gates argues, necessitate an immediate and larger focus on investment and resources to support those abandoned efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “Although climate change will have serious consequences – particularly for people in the poorest countries – it will not lead to humanity’s demise,” Gates wrote. “This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives. Our chief goal should be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions who live in the world’s poorest countries.”\n \n\n   \n  Gates’ shocking essay comes ahead of next month’s COP30, a global summit focused on battling climate change.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration  eliminated USAID , an international aid organization that supplied foreign countries with $8 billion in annual support to provide food and medicine to people who otherwise lack access to those life-saving necessities.\n \n\n   \n  Gates denied his new position represents a reversal from his past stances. He said in Tuesday’s essay that the world must continue to support its past efforts to achieve zero carbon emissions.\n \n\n   \n  However, Gates told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview Tuesday that pulling back from climate investment was a “huge disappointment,” albeit a necessary one. It also represents a stark contrast from where Gates had been focusing his efforts and philanthropy, including clean-energy businesses and lobby shops – and a turn from Gates’ tone from just a couple years ago.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2023 since-removed Breakthrough Energy essay, for example, Gates noted that most people around the world are struggling with the effects of climate change – a feeling that can be “overwhelming” and necessitates a response with “unprecedented” scale and speed.\n \n\n   \n  Some critics argue that Gates’ shift represents a false dichotomy: A significant amount of suffering that Gates now says is a priority is directly or indirectly a result of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  “Humans are resilient, and while billion-dollar disasters will become more frequent and devastating, humans will not be wiped from the face of the Earth,” Jennifer Francis, senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, which studies extreme weather and climate change, told CNN. “However… investment needs to continue to focus on curing the disease (emissions of heat-trapping gases) while also treating the symptoms, which include improving health and hunger, bolstering infrastructure, and preserving ecosystems.”\n \n\n   \n  Others believe Gates is missing the broader point.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no greater threat to developing nations than the climate crisis,” said Michael Mann, Director, Penn Center for Science, Sustainability & the Media. “He’s got this all backwards.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/skating-china-missile-toy-investigation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"12:35:00+00:00","title":"Skating governing body investigates ‘inappropriate’ toy missile displayed by Chinese athletes at competition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Skating Union has launched an investigation after Chinese ice dancers Ren Junfei and Xing Jianing were seen holding a plush toy version of China's DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missile during the Cup of China figure skating event in Chongqing on October 25, 2025.

assistance funds flowing \n       \n  By Marshall Cohen, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:56 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states sued the Trump administration Tuesday to prevent billions of dollars of cuts to federal food assistance that are  set to kick in  this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, claimed in the lawsuit that the Trump administration was threatening “illegal” cuts to SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program for 42 million Americans, “cannot simply suspend all benefits indefinitely, while refusing to spend funds from available appropriations for SNAP benefits for eligible households,” the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued it does not have the power to use that pot of existing money — known as its contingency fund — to cover the SNAP program beyond Saturday, because of the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,” officials in the Department of Agriculture wrote in a  memo  last week.\n \n\n   \n  The risk of tens of millions of Americans losing food aid has triggered intense anxiety across Washington, as the government shutdown nears the one-month mark.\n \n\n   \n  Top lawmakers from both parties acknowledge it would be the most significant impact of the shutdown to date, with House Speaker Mike Johnson  privately warning  his GOP members on a call Tuesday that the pain was about to spike for everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to block a GOP funding bill because it does not include their separate demands on extending  health care subsidies . But GOP leaders have refused to negotiate on the subsidies until the government reopens, leaving both parties in a bitter stalemate with no clear way out.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats  have been unflinching  in their stance, despite the looming Saturday deadline for the food aid. They argue that President Donald Trump has sought to “weaponize” the food assistance program, intentionally choosing not to fund the aid to pressure Democrats to yield.\n \n\n   \n    Fight over food aid\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the lawsuit was filed Tuesday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on “CN﻿N News Central” that there isn’t enough contingency funding to cover SNAP benefits for November, which she said would cost about $9.2 billion.\n \n\n   \n  “As of today, that $9.2 billion, we don’t even have close to that in contingency funding,” Rollins said. “We’ve got to get this government open.”\n \n\n   \n  She added that “all it takes is a ‘yes’ on a continuing resolution to keep the government going, and to send that (SNAP) money out to the states.”\n \n\n   \n  A so-called clean contin﻿uing resolution would extend government funding at current levels. But congressional Democrats have opposed that because Republicans haven’t agreed to negotiate on the expiring health care subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The White House referred CNN to the Office of Management and Budget for comment on the lawsuit. An OMB spokesperson said in a statement that “Democrats chose to shut down the government knowing full well that SNAP would soon run out of funds. It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s sad they are using the families who rely on it as pawns.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic attorney general: ‘This is wrong’ \n \n\n   \n  The Democratic-run states filed the lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court. Court records indicate the case was randomly assigned to District Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee who was confirmed in a bipartisan and unanimous Senate vote in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Congress approved $6 billion for a “SNAP-specific contingency fund” in the spending bill that  averted a shutdown  in March, the lawsuit notes. The lawsuit also points out that, as recently as September, the USDA website identified these funds as part of its plan to keep the food stamp payments flowing in case of a government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of using SNAP benefits “to play shutdown politics” at a news conference Tuesday announcing his support for the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is the department has the money,” Jackson said, adding, “They are looking to ratchet up the pain in an already painful moment. This is wrong, and it’s against the law.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dianne Gallagher contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/multiple-boats-us-military-strikes-pacific","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"12:54:00-04:00","title":"US military strikes 4 boats in the Pacific, killing 14, in ramp-up of campaign against alleged drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 28, 2025, the US military conducted three strikes in the eastern Pacific Ocean, targeting four boats allegedly operated by 'Designated Terrorist Organizations' involved in narcotics trafficking.

boats in the Pacific, killing 14, in ramp-up of campaign against alleged drug trafficking \n       \n  By Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:54 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted strikes against four more boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday, killing 14 people on board the vessels, with one survivor, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  It marked the first time multiple strikes were conducted on the same day as part of the Trump administration’s  accelerating campaign  against boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking. According to Hegseth, Mexican authorities have assumed responsibility for coordinating the search and rescue of the survivor.\n \n\n   \n  There were three strikes in the Pacific on Monday — with one hitting two boats at once — and bringing the number of known strikes carried out by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels to 13 since the start of September. To date, those operations have destroyed 14 boats and killed 57 people — with three survivors.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the  US military conducted its first round of strikes  in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which appeared to mark an expansion of the campaign as previous strikes had targeted boats in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a US strike against a vessel in the Caribbean also did not kill everyone on board. In that case, the US Navy  initially detained two survivors , but the Trump administration quickly  repatriated the two men  back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  The situation set up a dilemma because it was unclear what legal authority the US military would be able to cite to detain the survivors indefinitely.\n \n\n   \n  The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said during her daily news conference Tuesday that her government was informed about the Monday strike and about the potential survivor this morning. She added that the events occurred in international waters.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum said she instructed the foreign minister, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, to meet with the US ambassador to Mexico, Ron Johnson, “and we will give them the information with the Navy secretariat about this survivor, if it is the case that there was indeed a survivor.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said the boats targeted by the three latest strikes Monday were “being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organizations trafficking narcotics in the Eastern Pacific.”\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth added.\n \n\n   \n  “Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike, ”  Hegseth wrote on X . “All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mauricio Torres contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/trump-appeals-ny-hush-money-conviction-stormy-daniels","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"12:03:00-04:00","title":"Trump appeals New York hush money conviction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has appealed his criminal conviction in New York on 34 counts of falsifying business records, alleging the case was politically motivated and built on a flawed legal theory.

Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump appealed his criminal conviction on state charges related to a hush money scheme, arguing the case should never have been brought and the verdict should be overturned.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for Trump repeated many of the arguments that had been rejected throughout the investigation and trial, accusing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, of bringing a politically charged case, and alleging the judge erred by not recusing himself from the trial and allowing evidence Trump believes should have been excluded based on the concept of presidential immunity.\n \n\n   \n  “Targeting alleged conduct that has never been found to violate any New York law, the DA concocted a purported felony by stacking time-barred misdemeanors under a convoluted legal theory, which the DA then improperly obscured until the charge conference. This case should never have seen the inside of a courtroom, let alone resulted in a conviction,” Trump’s attorneys wrote in a 96-page filing.\n \n\n   \n  In May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up payments made to reimburse his personal attorney Michael Cohen who, days before the 2016 presidential election, advanced $130,000 to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged past sexual tryst with Trump. Trump has denied the affair.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was able to shed federal indictments looming over him, but the state case and conviction is the only one that made it to trial and resulted in Trump being a convicted felon turned president.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the appeal at the state court level, the president is simultaneously trying to move the state case into federal court where he believes he’ll have a better chance at overturning the verdict. An earlier attempt to move the case into federal court was denied by a district judge and Trump’s legal team is appealing that decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The Supreme Court’s historic decision on Immunity, the Federal and New York State Constitutions, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately overturned and dismissed,” a spokesperson for Trump told CNN in a statement. “President Trump will keep defeating Democrat weaponization at every turn as he focuses on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.”\n \n\n   \n  In his legal argument before New York’s Supreme Court’s Appellate Division, First Department, Trump’s lawyers repeated many of his past arguments, including that federal election law should pre-empt state election law.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecution’s theory was that Trump falsified the business records to influence the 2016 election. Several witnesses, including David Pecker, Trump’s long-time friend who at the time ran the company that published the National Enquirer, testified about “catch and kill” deals. Trump argued that since federal prosecutors did not bring federal election charges against him, the state should not have been able to bring a case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s lawyers also argued that Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, made several errors. They argued Merchan should not have allowed the jury to hear any evidence that involved official presidential acts, including testimony from Trump aide Hope Hicks, and that Merchan, who gave $35 in donations to Democrats, should have recused himself based on his own donations and his daughter’s job at a political consulting company that worked on the Biden campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Federal law expressly preempts (the New York district attorney’s) misdemeanor-turned-felony charges because those charges rest on an alleged violation of federal campaign regulations that States cannot (and have never) enforced. The trial was fatally marred by the introduction of official Presidential acts that the Supreme Court has made clear cannot be used as evidence against a President. The jury was instructed incorrectly, allowing a conviction without the unanimity required by both New York law and basic due process. Beyond these fatal flaws, the evidence was clearly insufficient to convict,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Merchan previously rejected all of these arguments in denying a bid to overturn the conviction.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who after the verdict went on to win the presidential election, was sentenced days before his inauguration to an unconditional discharge — no jail time and no restrictions.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/government-shutdown-key-deadlines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00Z","title":"Key Dates That Could Intensify Pressure on Lawmakers to End the Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal government shutdown is entering its fifth week and could become the longest in U.S. history, with little sign of compromise.

Americans starting to feel the consequences of the shutdown should bring at least some pressure to bear on lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s run through some key events on the timeline, and what each could mean politically.\n \n\n   \n    Today: Air traffic controllers miss first full paycheck\n \n\n   \n  The date of the first missed paycheck for federal employees differs for different workers. On Tuesday, it’s  air traffic controllers missing their first full ones .\n \n\n   \n  These officials, who are considered essential workers who must work during the shutdown, have already been under immense pressure amid a series of mistakes and increased scrutiny all year. Staffing shortages have already caused flight delays, and there is fear that missing paychecks will exacerbate things. The disruption for traveling Americans could force lawmakers to act.\n \n\n   \n  That’s more or less what put the final nail in the longest partial government shutdown in history, the 35-day shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019. Ten air traffic controllers  decided to stay home , temporarily halting travel at some major hubs and leading President Donald Trump to agree to a three-week pause in his border wall demand. (Trump and the GOP eventually gave up.)\n \n\n   \n    October 31: Military paychecks\n \n\n   \n  This could be the  first time in history  that members of all military branches will miss a paycheck during a shutdown, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center – though that distinction could get pushed to November 15.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration  reallocated $8 billion  to cover October 15 paychecks. Last week, it announced  a $130 million gift  from an anonymous Trump “friend” to help pay service members (though that would only cover about $100 per person and raised its own legal questions.) Over the weekend, the administration suggested other maneuvers  could cover the troops until November 15 .\n \n\n   \n  Paying the troops is a politically sensitive subject – the kind of thing that could lead members of both parties to feel pressure to find an offramp.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s possible it could weigh more heavily on Democrats, for a few reasons. One is that they are the ones making an extra policy demand during this shutdown. And the other is that they might worry Trump would use this as part of  his efforts to politicize the military . Trump has repeatedly in recent weeks sought to pit the military against Democrats, including blaming them for jeopardizing military paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  “And I want you to know that despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump told members of the Navy earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  He has twice blamed Democrats for standing in the way of a military pay raise, citing “this little gnat that’s on our shoulder called the Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n    Nov. 1: Obamacare premium increases and SNAP benefits\n \n\n   \n  This could be the most pivotal day.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because it joins two major impacts: millions of Americans seeing their  Obamacare marketplace premiums rise sharply  as open enrollment begins, and  42 million people suddenly being at risk  of losing critical food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. (The SNAP impact arrives alongside potential cutbacks in  other programs for low-income Americans  like Head Start).\n \n\n   \n  On SNAP, some Senate Republicans like Josh Hawley of Missouri are pushing for a  stopgap measure . But Senate GOP leadership is wary that this could hurt their leverage by continuing to delay the worst of the shutdown’s impacts. Democrats, meanwhile, insist they will  press forward  in their shutdown strategy regardless. “We understand this is not easy, and this is going to be painful,” the No. 3 House Democrat, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, said when asked about SNAP, arguing that Trump is choosing to make things more painful by not allowing  SNAP benefits  to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  The beginning of open enrollment could conceivably go two ways.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, people seeing their premiums suddenly double or rise even more could ratchet up pressure on Republicans to negotiate over the enhanced Obamacare subsidies extension that Democrats are demanding.\n \n\n   \n  On the other, the arrival of the deadline could lead Democrats to reason that they fought the good fight and can move on, believing they emphasized how Republicans now own those premium increases.\n \n\n   \n    Nov. 4: Election Day\n \n\n   \n  We’ll see a handful of elections on Tuesday, including governors races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York City mayoral race and a redistricting ballot measure in California.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is the one where you might expect to see shutdown impacts because so many federal workers live there, but the shutdown  hasn’t been a huge focal point  in that or any other campaign.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, if Tuesday’s results swing unexpectedly in one direction or another, it could lead the side that underperforms to wonder if they have as much political strength as they thought.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is considered the favorite in the Virginia governor’s race, which history suggests should favor Democrats given Republicans won the White House the previous year. (These races  usually swing in the opposite direction  of the presidency.)\n \n\n   \n  If Spanberger wins big, Democrats could reason they are on firm footing and should hold strong on their demands. If either this race or the New Jersey governor’s race are closer than expected, perhaps you’ll see some Democrats start to worry more about overplaying their hand.\n \n\n   \n    Nov. 5: When it becomes the longest shutdown ever\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else spurs lawmakers to come to an agreement, maybe ignominy can?\n \n\n   \n  At this point, the shutdown will surpass the 2018-19 version as the longest in history.\n \n\n   \n    Nov. 21: The House-passed CR expires\n \n\n   \n  Just how intractable are things? So intractable that it’s possible the House might have to pass another stopgap funding measure (or continuing resolution) because the shutdown will have outlived the one it originally passed but the Senate never did.\n \n\n   \n  Before the shutdown began, the House passed a continuing resolution that would have funded the government only through November 21.\n \n\n   \n  What would that mean, practically speaking? Well for one, the House would finally have to come back in session – something  Speaker Mike Johnson has resolutely avoided .\n \n\n   \n  At that point he would seemingly have to swear in Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who won a special election more than a month ago but whom Johnson has  refused to swear in . Grijalva would soon become the crucial 218th signature for the Jeffrey Epstein files  discharge petition , forcing that issue.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps bringing the House back in session might lead to more pressure to negotiate over the Obamacare subsidies from Republicans like  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia  and others who have suggested the GOP faces political peril over  this issue. \n \n\n   \n    Thanksgiving\n \n\n   \n  The holiday is set for November 27, but travel will begin days earlier. It’s at this point that any lingering problems with airports, other travel and relevant government services would really start to come into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Holidays can also prove powerful motivators for lawmakers to get their business done  – so that they can spend time with their families without the threat of being pulled back to work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/chicago-protestors-tear-gas-gregory-bovino","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-12:43","title":"Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino Ordered to Appear in Court Over Alleged Aggressive Tactics in Chicago","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino has been ordered to appear in court in Chicago over allegations that he threw a tear gas canister into a crowd during a protest in the Little Village neighborhood. This incident follows a broader pattern of aggressive tactics by federal agents under Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration immigration enforcement campaign that has resulted in over 1,000 arrests. US District Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order on October 9, 2025, banning the use of certain force and crowd control measures, including tear gas and pepper balls, citing incidents such as a pastor being shot with pepper balls and multiple deployments of chemical agents without warning.

In recent weeks she’s said she has concerns about whether her order was being followed.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the incidents in question.\n \n\n   \n    Multiple violations of the order\n \n\n   \n  A court filing against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says Bovino, the California-based Border Patrol chief who has been put in  charge  of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown in Chicago, “apparently threw tear gas into a crowd without justification” during a protest against immigration authorities in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood. The filing was issued Friday by the Chicago Headline Club, a press freedom group.\n \n\n   \n  A video obtained by CNN shows a tense scene leading up to the moment when Bovino throws an apparent tear gas canister toward a group of protesters.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said in a  statement  Friday on social media that a “mob of rioters” struck Bovino in the head with an object and agents used “chemical munitions” after repeating “multiple warnings to back up.” That same day, Bovino was ordered to appear before the judge.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has not seen video of Bovino being hit in the head with an object.\n \n\n   \n  The incident is the latest example of aggressive crowd control tactics used by federal agents throughout Operation Midway Blitz, an immigration enforcement operation that has resulted in more than 1,000  arrests  since it began September 8.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents descended on the north side of the city over the weekend as part of the operation. They appeared to deploy tear gas Saturday morning in the Old Irving Park neighborhood of Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Since Ellis’ October 9 temporary restraining order, several violations of the order have come under scrutiny as DHS agents continue their immigration enforcement throughout the city.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Trump administration officials overseeing immigration enforcement actions for the operation appeared in front of the judge about their use of these tactics in standoffs with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Three incidents were the primary focus of the October 20 hearing where Ellis peppered two DHS leaders about the use of these crowd control tactics that she said violated her order.\n \n\n   \n    Incidents in question\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ 14-day restraining order followed video of a pastor being shot by pepper balls during a September demonstration outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago. The order blocks ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents from using certain types of force and crowd control.\n \n\n   \n  The Rev. David Black of Chicago’s First Presbyterian Church was wearing a clerical collar when federal agents fired pepper balls at him repeatedly.\n \n\n   \n  In the October 20 hearing, Ellis questioned Deputy ICE Field Office Director Shawn Byers about the incident. He said the pastor was given multiple commands to remove himself from federal property and didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Ellis summoned Trump administration leaders to question them about violations of the order, asking them about their respective command structures and why they deployed chemical munitions in each incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge questioned Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick about an October 12  incident  in Albany Park, another community north of Chicago, where federal agents deployed what appears to be a chemical agent to deter the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, CBP agents pursued and crashed into a vehicle during an immigration enforcement operation in a neighborhood of Chicago’s East Side.\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, a large crowd began to form around an intersection close by. The crowd turned “hostile,” the DHS told CNN, and agents used crowd control measures.\n \n\n   \n  Photos and videos from the scene show Chicago residents fleeing as agents fired tear gas canisters.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis also mentioned an October 19 incident in the suburb of Rolling Meadows, where a federal agent was recorded pointing a weapon at bystanders outside an ice cream shop.\n \n\n   \n    Further alleged violations\n \n\n   \n  In Irving Park on Saturday, CBP agents detained a construction worker before tear gas appeared to be deployed. A crowd began to form around the agents and a neighbor who did not want to be named said they witnessed two people “tossed to the ground.” including a man who was approximately 70 years old.\n \n\n   \n  “Border Patrol agents were surrounded and boxed in by a group of agitators,” DHS said in a Monday statement to CNN. “To safely clear the area after multiple warnings and the crowd continuing to advance on them, Border Patrol had to deploy crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Headline Club filed another complaint against DHS on Monday, flagging what it said were several violations of the court’s temporary restraining order from this incident.\n \n\n   \n  After making arrests while leaving the scene, “without any audible warning, agents deployed tear gas” that later caught fire, the plaintiffs alleged.\n \n\n   \n   Correction: An earlier version of this story misnamed Bovino’s agency. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/zohran-mamdani-sept-11-aunt","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"11:35:00-04:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani Faces Pushback Over His Story About a Family Member’s Post-9/11 Fears","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final days of New York City’s mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani faced significant pushback for claiming that his father’s cousin (referred to as an aunt) was afraid to wear her hijab after the 9/11 attacks.

     11:35 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the final days of New York City’s mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has faced pushback over a  story he told about his aunt  being afraid to wear her hijab while riding the subway after the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n \n\n   \n  National Republicans including Vice President JD Vance mocked Mamdani’s story, which the nominee told during a Friday speech criticizing his rival Andrew Cuomo for  appearing to laugh along  with a radio host who suggested Mamdani would cheer another 9/11.\n \n\n   \n  Accounts on X flagged a LinkedIn profile belonging to Mamdani’s father’s sister in which she is not wearing a head covering.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani told reporters Monday that he was speaking about “Zehra fuhi, my father’s cousin, who passed away a few years ago.” (Fuhi is a term in Urdu and Hindi that means paternal aunt. Mamdani was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin.)\n \n\n   \n  That led to a New York Post headline referring to Mamdani’s “aunt” in quotation marks – and sharp questioning during a Tuesday morning radio interview.\n \n\n   \n  “My question is, how can you, Zohran Mamdani, convince New Yorkers to go and vote for you when you just said you lied?” said Carlos Molina, one of the hosts on Latino radio station La Mega 97.9’s “El Vacilón de la Mañana.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a lie,” Mamdani responded. “My father’s cousin is my aunt. That is how I referred to her all my life.”\n \n\n   \n  The argument over what constitutes a family member underscored both the sensitivity of the 9/11 attacks in New York City 24 years on as well as how Mamdani has leaned into discussing his Muslim faith and upbringing during the campaign. The 34-year-old is vying to become the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has accused right-wing media and his opponents of trying to discredit his story instead of focusing on Cuomo’s attacks on his faith and the suggestions that Mamdani would be soft on terrorism or crime.\n \n\n   \n  “It just shows the idea of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and feeling uncomfortable after 9/11 is so foreign to the right wing in this city and this country that the only answer to them is that it must be a lie,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the hosts Tuesday morning weren’t ready to back down.\n \n\n   \n  “The reason I am being so hard on you is because you’re going to be the mayor of the biggest city in the United States and we need to know that our politicians that we are electing (are) truthful,” Molina said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded by saying he understood New Yorkers who read the New York Post, one of the city’s daily newspapers that has long been critical of him, would be confused. He then ended the interaction by teasing Molina for pressing him about the type of mayor he would be even though the host doesn’t live in New York and was not sitting in the studio to question him in person. Molina lives in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t even take this as you coming at me hard – these are the questions you should be asking, I understand if you’re opening up the New York Post and this is what you read, many New Yorkers will say well how am I supposed to feel about it, so you’re giving the opportunity to tell the truth and correct the record,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to be a mayor so honest that you come back to New York City, my brother,” Mamdani said to laughs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/baseball-mlb-shohei-ohtani-history-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"11:33:00-04:00","title":"Shohei Ohtani’s Historic October Night: A Record-Setting Performance in World Series Game","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani delivered a record-breaking performance in a marathon 18-inning World Series game, becoming the first player in postseason history to have multiple doubles, multiple home runs, and multiple walks in a single game, and the first to have four intentional walks.

Tuesday night’s game will be yet another for the history books \n       \n  Analysis by Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:33 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The superlatives to describe  Shohei Ohtani’s performance  this October are running out as quickly as Dodger Stadium ran out of food in Monday’s  marathon World Series  game.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday, he’s about to once again do something baseball has never seen.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani’s  monster 4-4 night  – which included two home runs, two doubles, an astonishing five walks and 12 total bases – helped the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-5 win in 18 innings on Monday. The game ended just before midnight Pacific time, giving the Japanese superstar about 17 hours to rest and recuperate before he takes the mound as LA’s starter in Game 4 on Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s spent. He was on base eight, nine times tonight, running the bases. He’s elated. But, yeah, he’s taking the mound tomorrow. He’ll be ready,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after Monday’s game.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts may have lost count, as Ohtani was officially on base nine times in a single game – a new postseason record. His two home runs and two doubles made him the second player ever to have four extra base hits in a World Series game. He’s the first player in postseason history to have multiple doubles, multiple homers and multiple walks in the same postseason game, and the second player to ever do it in history.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s not all. He’s the first player to have four intentional walks in a postseason game, the first player with three multi-homer games in the same postseason, is tied for the most career postseason home runs by a Japanese player with Hideki Matsui and his eight home runs in the 2025 postseason are tied for second all time.\n \n\n   \n  To put it mildly, all of that taken together is frankly insane.\n \n\n   \n  “Shohei’s game, I hope we don’t lose sight of … our starting pitcher tomorrow got on base nine times tonight,” said Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers first baseman who hit the walk-off solo shot that finally won the game for Los Angeles in the 18th inning on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Just incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  After all that, Ohtani is set to take the mound at Dodger Stadium – a mind-boggling thought all on its own given the standard treatment of starting pitchers in modern baseball.\n \n\n   \n  Starting pitchers these days are usually creatures of habit. Typically, they pitch every five days and have strict fitness regimens that they follow on each of those days to get themselves ready to hit peak performance. It’s not unheard of for starters to leave a game early if they’re starting the next day to ensure they get enough rest.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani, though, is far from typical. And it’s not a stretch that Tuesday’s start will put his postseason in a category all its own, surpassing even the legendary achievements of Babe Ruth.\n \n\n   \n  Ruth is obviously the easiest comparison for Ohtani’s career, as absurd as that feels. The Great Bambino was his era’s most prolific home run hitter and started his career as one of the game’s best pitchers as well. But even the Babe never played in a six-and-a-half-hour World Series game and then pitched the next day – when he was still pitching for the Boston Red Sox in 1916 and 1918, none of the games in those World Series lasted more than two-and-a-half hours.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Ohtani took the mound was in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, turning in a sterling six innings, allowing two hits and striking out 10 batters. In that same game, he hit three home runs becoming the 12th hitter to hit three homers in a playoff game.\n \n\n   \n  But to do both of those things in the same game? Unheard of. No player had ever struck out 10 hitters and hit multiple home runs in the same contest.\n \n\n   \n  When Ohtani takes the mound tonight in Chavez Ravine, he’ll have the opportunity to put his team on the verge of clinching a second-straight World Series championship, which hasn’t been done since the dynasty New York Yankees teams of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n \n\n   \n  But don’t count on him having too many more opportunities to hurt the  Toronto Blue Jays  at the plate. The AL champions are planning on continuing the strategy they developed in the late innings on Monday: Simply walking Ohtani every chance they get.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to pitch around him,” said John Schneider, the Blue Jays’ manager, of Ohtani’s seventh-inning home run that tied the game and set the stage for the 18-inning marathon.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Sometimes, for pitchers, it’s hard to do that when you’re kind of trying to throw a ball and didn’t put it where you want to put it. But he had a great game, he’s great player, but I think after that, you just kind of take the bat out of his hands.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked if he plans on issuing Ohtani intentional walks going forward, Schneider simply said, “Yeah.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts said he understands.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s the best player on the planet, and he was on the heels of a huge offensive night, and John smelled that and wasn’t going to let Shohei beat him at all, obviously,” the Dodgers manager said, “and even when nobody’s on base and putting him on to make the other guys beat him. Respect it and, fortunately, we have other guys behind Shohei that can still do some things.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/health/pig-kidney-transplant-tim-andrews","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"11:49:00-04:00","title":"Pig Kidney Removed from New Hampshire Man After a Record 271 Days","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tim Andrews, a 67-year-old man from New Hampshire, received a genetically modified pig kidney transplant in January 2025 and lived with it for 271 days before surgeons at Massachusetts General Brigham removed it due to declining kidney function.

Dialysis saved his life, but the process was draining: He was connected to the machines for six hours, three days a week. On days off, he’d sleep. By the time he woke up, he’d have to start the process all over again.\n \n\n   \n  Andrews knew it was risky to try a xenotransplant – transplanting an animal organ into a human – but  he said  that if it could keep him off dialysis and help other people with kidney problems, it was worth it.\n \n\n   \n  In the CNN documentary “Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: Animal Pharm,” he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that the pig kidney left him feeling re-energized and revitalized.\n \n\n   \n  “I was alive, and I hadn’t been in a long time,” Andrews said, calling the transplant “a miracle.”\n \n\n   \n  With the pig kidney, he said he was slowly rebuilding his life. He has been able to cook, vacuum and take long walks with his dog Cupcake. In June, he was even able to throw out the first pitch at Fenway Park and cheer on his beloved Boston Red Sox.\n \n\n   \n  “I had the honor of meeting Tim earlier this year, and his positivity and energy were unwavering,” Gupta said Monday. “He was so committed to the idea of his transplant experience furthering our understanding of xenotransplant and helping patients like himself. His willingness to undergo this procedure and be part of medical history now will no doubt be felt by the thousands of future patients with kidney failure. He is a true pioneer.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Monday, Mass General Brigham called Andrews a “selfless medical pioneer and an inspiration to patients with kidney failure around the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrews posted on Facebook on Saturday that “this was a punishing journey filled with unknowns and surprises.” He added that “there were experimental drugs that had some unexpected side effects,” but for the nine months he was able to live with the pig kidney, he said, “I am proud of everything we discovered, learned and experienced.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrews also expressed his gratitude to the pig who gave him the time off of dialysis, calling her “my hero.”\n \n\n   \n  “What a warrior she became helping fight through several ‘bumps in the road,’ ” he wrote. “Wilma the genetically edited pig is a major part of this medical breakthrough and a major part of my soul as long as I live. I LOVE YOU WILMA! Donate a Kidney and be a HERO!”\n \n\n   \n  As Andrews resumes dialysis, he will remain on the waiting list for a human kidney transplant. More than 170 million people are registered organ donors, according to the  Organ Donor Foundation , but  nearly 90,000  people are waiting for a kidney in the US.\n \n\n   \n  In  March 2024 , Richard Slayman became the first patient to get a pig kidney in the US. He died two months later from causes not related to the transplant. The second, Lisa Pisano, received a mechanical heart pump in addition to the pig kidney in April 2024. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was  removed  the next month, and she died in  July 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  In November 2024, doctors at NYU gave 53-year-old  Towana Looney  a genetically modified pig kidney that functioned for four months and nine days. They had to  remove  it in April when her immune system started to reject it.\n \n\n   \n  In June, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital performed another experimental pig kidney transplant, that one with  54-year-old patient Bill Stewart . The athletic trainer and physical therapist’s blood type made it harder to find a human match. The transplant went so well that Stewart was able to go home and go back to work. In September, Steward said his energy wasn’t where he wanted it to be, but he was happy to have the procedure behind him “and know that there’s hopefully, a bright future ahead.”\n \n\n   \n  Mass General Brigham said it will do another pig-to-human kidney transplant later this year.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/media/cnn-all-access-subscriptions-service","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"10:34:00-04:00","title":"CNN charts new course with All Access streaming subscriptions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CNN has launched a new streaming subscription service, All Access, designed to meet the growing demand from cable cord-cutters and mobile-first news consumers.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  CNN is introducing a streaming subscription option called  All Access , charting a new course in a media era defined by direct-to-consumer relationships and mobile-first news reports.\n \n\n   \n  The new service, which is built into CNN’s existing apps and websites, features multiple live TV streams of news coverage and exclusive content. The target audience includes cable cord-cutters and people who consume news primarily on their phones.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not CNN ‘extra’ or ‘plus,’ it’s CNN,” the network’s CEO, Mark Thompson, said in an interview, conveying how All Access carries “all the programs you expect to get from CNN.”\n \n\n   \n  The streaming schedule largely mirrors CNN’s existing US cable channel, including the complete prime-time lineup, mixed with a few hours from two other CNN channels.\n \n\n   \n  “This is live at its core,” said Alex MacCallum, CNN’s executive vice president for digital products and services.\n \n\n   \n  The subscription offering also includes access to live feeds from the field, an extensive video-on-demand library and several internet-native show formats.\n \n\n   \n  Later this week, for example, Anderson Cooper will begin hosting “All There Is Live,” a weekly companion broadcast to his popular “All There Is” podcast, which explores grief. Cooper’s viewers will be able to share their stories with Cooper, his guests and each other in real-time — something that’s not possible on his nightly TV newscast.\n \n\n   \n  However, crucially, from the point of view of would-be subscribers, “Anderson Cooper 360” will stream on All Access.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s previous, short-lived streaming service, CNN+, was criticized for lacking the network’s flagship newscasts. This glaring weakness stemmed from a double-edged sword known as carriage contracts — longstanding cable and satellite distribution deals that made CNN highly profitable but, for many years, hamstrung its ability to sell its programming directly to viewers.\n \n\n   \n  But the distribution business is being transformed. As streaming services like Netflix have exploded in popularity, tens of millions of US households have stopped subscribing to traditional cable bundles, meaning many homes can no longer simply turn on CNN.\n \n\n   \n  As this cord-cutting phenomenon has become an existential crisis, carriage deals have been renegotiated all across the industry, giving channel owners more flexibility while ensuring that cord-keepers still get value for their monthly payments.\n \n\n   \n  And the “plus” products have largely been retired. Over the summer, ESPN launched an  eponymous direct-to-consumer streaming service  right inside its existing apps, providing a new option for fans without cable.\n \n\n   \n  CNN is doing much the same thing now. MacCallum said the company’s market research has found “there are 18 million people in the US alone who no longer have cable, are CNN fans, and have indicated willingness to pay for a product from CNN.”\n \n\n   \n  That is the starting point, so to speak, for CNN’s marketers.\n \n\n   \n  All Access is live in the US as of Tuesday, and company executives say they intend to expand to other parts of the world over time.\n \n\n   \n    Attempting a New York Times-like pivot\n \n\n   \n  The launch of All Access comes one year after CNN implemented a partial digital paywall, charging users $3.99 per month for unlimited access to the sprawling CNN website.\n \n\n   \n  That subscription tier is now called “Basic,” while “All Access” becomes the main priority as it provides a full multimedia experience.\n \n\n   \n  All Access costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. CNN is enticing users to pay annually by offering an intro price of $41.99 for the first year.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson said he believes it is “the most ambitious digital offering from any news provider of TV heritage.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, CNN’s rollout of a full-fledged subscription news service has been closely watched across the American media industry, as no other major network has attempted a New York Times-like pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News has operated a streaming subscription service, Fox Nation, for years, but it is largely known for its conservative-themed entertainment programming.\n \n\n   \n  The US broadcast network news divisions all have free ad-supported streaming channels, but none have pursued a subscriber model.\n \n\n   \n  Across the news industry, however, there is widespread agreement that subscriptions are the path to sustainability, whether at the institutional level or individually on platforms like Substack and Patreon.\n \n\n   \n  If successful, CNN’s paid tiers will reorient the company’s business over time, making it less reliant on cable subscriber revenue and giving it more direct relationships with news viewers and readers.\n \n\n   \n  The Times has become the envy of news publishers by building a digital subscription bundle with games, recipes and reviews alongside core reporting and commentary.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson and MacCallum spearheaded The Times’ shift to digital subscriptions, and in effect, they’re now trying to launch a video-centric version inside CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You come into the experience and you immediately go into the live stream,” MacCallum said as she demonstrated the app for colleagues recently. “We have this channel changer at the bottom, so a user can switch between the different channels.”\n \n\n   \n  The main “CNN Stream” starts with “Early Start” at 5 a.m. ET on weekdays and remains live all the way through “Laura Coates Live” at 11 p.m. A handful of CNN US hours in between won’t be streamed, in a concession to cable and satellite distributors, but those hours will be replaced by shows from CNN International and CNN Headlines.\n \n\n   \n  By and large, the full-fledged CNN is streaming all day long — not an alternative version, a la CNN+, but the anchors and shows viewers already know.\n \n\n   \n  The “unlimited shelf space” of digital, as MacCallum put it, allows for many other programming options as well. CNN International is streaming weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. Another channel includes CNN’s original series and films.\n \n\n   \n  MacCallum said there will be “pop-up channels” and “alt-casts” for breaking news stories and special events.\n \n\n   \n  She said users will see that “we are leaning into our incredible global news reporting capabilities and leveraging the journalistic engine of CNN.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/health/tylenol-lawsuit-texas-ken-paxton","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-04:00","title":"Texas Attorney General Sues Tylenol Makers, Claiming Links to Autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson, alleging that they deceptively marketed Tylenol as safe for pregnant women and children, despite claims that its active ingredient, acetaminophen, increases autism risk.

Kenvue said in a statement that the medication is safe and the company will “vigorously defend” against the claims.\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit , dated Monday and filed in the District Court of Panola County, Texas, comes about a month after President Donald Trump  publicly claimed  that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism in the child, despite decades of evidence that the medication is safe.\n \n\n   \n  “Big Pharma betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks. These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,” Paxton, the state’s Republican attorney general, who is also running for US Senate, said in a  news release  Tuesday. “By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit claims that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act because they knew that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, “is dangerous to unborn children and young children” and “they hid this danger and deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women,” according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s lawsuit has requested a jury trial and, in part, calls for the companies to “destroy any marketing or advertising materials in their possession that represent, directly or indirectly, that Tylenol is safe for pregnant women and children.” The lawsuit also calls for the companies to pay civil penalties to the state in the amount of $10,000 per violation.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of the people who use our products. We are deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children,” Kenvue said in an emailed  statement  Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We will vigorously defend ourselves against these claims and respond per the legal process. We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” the statement said in part. “We also encourage expecting mothers to speak to their health professional before taking any over-the-counter medication, including acetaminophen, as indicated on our product label for Tylenol®.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a Johnson & Johnson company spokesperson said it “divested its consumer health business years ago, and all rights and liabilities associated with the sale of its over-the-counter products, including Tylenol (acetaminophen), are owned by  Kenvue .”\n \n\n   \n  Experts have said there are multiple causes of autism, and the science showing a connection between autism and Tylenol is  not settled .\n \n\n   \n  “Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,  said in a statement in September .\n \n\n   \n  “Acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever, which can be harmful to pregnant people when left untreated. Maternal fever, headaches as an early sign of preeclampsia, and pain are all managed with the therapeutic use of acetaminophen, making acetaminophen essential to the people who need it,” he said. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/middleeast/hamas-return-hostage-body-monday-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"11:32:00-04:00","title":"Netanyahu says Hamas violated Gaza ceasefire by returning remains not linked to missing hostages","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a reported violation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Hamas of returning remains of Ofir Tzarfati, whose body was already recovered in November 2023, thus violating the agreement that only remains of missing hostages would be returned.

two men in their thirties and known to police were detained on Saturday evening local time.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities were able to track down the individuals after analyzing more than 150 samples of DNA left at the scene, BFMTV reported. Both men are from the Parisian suburb of Aubervilliers, where one of them was arrested, it added, while two others suspected of being involved in the heist remain at large.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that “one of the men arrested was preparing to leave the territory from Roissy airport,” also known as Charles de Gaulle airport, near Paris. BFMTV reported, citing sources, that he was arrested during a passport check before he could board an evening flight to Algeria.\n \n\n   \n  The stolen jewels – comprising nine items including an emerald necklace set among more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were not recovered when the two arrests were made, BFMTV said.\n \n\n   \n  France’s Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez congratulated the investigators for the arrests, who he said “have worked tirelessly, as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre’s upper floor last weekend, which houses the French Crown Jewels.

shootings in the United States so far this year, as of October 27. Thirty-seven were on college campuses, and 27 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 26 people dead and at least 100 other victims injured, according to CNN’s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cross checks these reports of school shootings against school and police accounts and media reports. All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter. School property includes but is not limited to, buildings, fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses. Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security.\n \n\n   \n  In the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds. Since then, recent years saw a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008. There were at least 83 incidents in 2024, but   2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 47 fatalities, according to CNN’s analysis. That year saw the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two educators were killed and more than a dozen others were injured.\n \n\n   \n  Students and educators have engaged in  activism  around the issue of gun violence, and some educators have  quit  the profession.\n \n\n   \n  Some states in the South have seen the highest rate of school shootings relative to their populations since 2008, according to CNN’s analysis. Washington, DC had the highest rate — 6 total shootings, almost 1 per 100,000 people — while Texas had the most overall with 65 school shootings.

Trump last November. Now they could be key to picking New Jersey’s next governor \n       \n  By Arlette Saenz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:48 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the race for New Jersey governor, Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill is trying to reverse  Donald Trump’s  gains with Latino voters in the 2024 election while her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, is seeking to build on them.\n \n\n   \n  Their dueling missions collided on recent back-to-back days in this northern New Jersey county, where Ciattarelli worked to turn out early voters in Clifton with the governor of Puerto Rico, Republican Jenniffer González-Colón.\n \n\n   \n  In neighboring Paterson one day later, Sherrill campaigned with Democratic Rep. Nellie Pou, who represents the area, sprinkling in some Spanish to rev up the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “ Recuerda, este estado no es rojo. No es morado. Es azul ,” Sherrill said, which translates to, “Remember, this state is not red. It is not purple. It is blue.”\n \n\n   \n  One year after Trump  made inroads with Latino voters  in the Garden State and beyond, the race for New Jersey governor is serving as a fresh test of where the key voting bloc stands 10 months into the president’s second term. The results of next week’s contest could offer roadmaps for both parties as they look to build support among one of the country’s fastest growing demographics.\n \n\n   \n  “We will make the difference,” Patricia Campos-Medina, a vice chair of Sherrill’s campaign, said of Latino voters. “This is a getting-voters-out election at this moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Latino residents make up nearly 22% of New Jersey’s population, and no county saw a bigger move toward Trump than Passaic, where Latinos account for roughly 43% of the population — the largest share in the state.\n \n\n   \n   In 2020 , Trump lost the county to Joe Biden by 16 points.  Four years later , Trump bested then-Vice President Kamala Harris here by nearly 3 points. In the city of Passaic, where more than 70% of residents are Hispanic, Trump defeated Harris by nearly 1,100 votes, a swing from Biden’s almost 5,000-vote advantage.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump could not have done as well as he did without getting Democrat Hispanics to vote for him, and Jack Ciattarelli is not going to win this election without getting Democrat Hispanics to vote for him,” said Kenny Gonzalez, Hispanic spokesperson for the New Jersey Republican State Committee. “So many Democrats are leaving the Democrat Party simply because the Democrat Party has gone too far left.”   \n \n\n   \n  While Passaic County voters chose Trump at the top of the ticket, they elected Pou to the US House, making her one of only 13 Democrats nationwide representing a congressional seat won by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters went, voted for President Trump, and then moved over and voted right down the line for the Democratic candidates,” said Passaic Mayor Hector Lora, who is supporting Sherrill. “People say that somehow the city went red. The city didn’t go red. The city went with President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s gains with Latino voters in New Jersey  mirror an improvement  with the community that played out across the country in the 2024 presidential election. But there are questions about whether that support will hold and extend to other Republican candidates, especially at a time when the president has seen some erosion in his standing among Latinos.\n \n\n   \n  An  AP-NORC poll  conducted in October found 25% of Hispanic adults nationally have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of the president — dropping from 44% in January just before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, a slim majority of Hispanic registered voters (53%) said they would vote for Sherrill, according to a  Fox News poll  conducted earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Lora, who is also an evangelical pastor, hosted both candidates for meetings with religious leaders in Passaic this summer.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what’s on the ballot today for those to consider … is not just the candidates, but the very identity of cities like ours and the state of New Jersey,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Building off Trump’s gains\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Ciattarelli was surrounded by a group of Latino pastors who endorsed and prayed over him at the Bonfire Mofongo House and Lounge in Paterson — his first stop on a four-day swing through Passaic County as early in-person voting kicked off this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “ Es hora !” Ciattarelli told the mostly Latino crowd, a phrase translating to, “It’s time.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want you to continue to grow. I want you to continue to prosper, and that’s what my governorship is all about for every one of our minority communities,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with CNN, Ciattarelli, who lost by a little more than 3 points to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021, cited Trump’s improvement with the Latino community and said he hopes to extend those gains.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s 2 million Hispanic Americans that call New Jersey home,” he said. “We’ve worked every minority community hard all across the state.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli is banking on voters like Leonardo Pomales, a Passaic resident originally from Puerto Rico, who voted in a governor’s race for the first time on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “The taxes, the electric bills and the schools, that’s very important to me,” Pomales said as he explained his vote for Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Pomales said he voted for Hillary Clinton in her matchup against Trump in 2016 but then backed the president in his next two runs, pointing to his policies on the economy, border and education.\n \n\n   \n  “The Democratic Party has always said they’re going to do something. They don’t. They only want our votes, and they don’t do nothing,” Pomales said. “He’s not perfect, but hey, that’s what we want. We want to feel safe in our own country.”\n \n\n   \n  Orietta Fernandez, a Republican living in Clifton, said she’s frustrated with immigration, crediting Trump for his approach after she said Biden’s border policies allowed in people with “no good behavior.” More people respected the immigration process when she came to the country from Peru 25 years ago, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “People come to the United States because they want to have everything for free, and that is not fair,” said Fernandez, who voted for Ciattarelli and supported Trump last year. “I never took advantage of the system. I worked hard.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic outreach centers on costs\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders in the state, including Sherrill, acknowledged Trump’s appeal to Latino voters in 2024 stemmed from how he spoke about the economy. But they argued the Latino community is starting to see he’s failed to fulfill those promises.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there was a movement towards the president because he promised to cut costs and people are very cost sensitive here,” Sherrill told CNN, noting Latino voters are a “huge” part of her strategy. “He committed to driving those down and in fact has done the opposite.”\n \n\n   \n  Campos-Medina said their campaign’s outreach to Latino voters has drilled in on reducing utility costs, investing in small businesses and tackling rising rents. “Those are three things that resonate very closely with where the Latino vote is at,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But Lora also argued some Latino voters, particularly those from religious backgrounds, have struggled with some of the Democratic Party’s social stances.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some issues that don’t need to be shoved down the throat of everyone,” he said. “The big-tent party needs to stop looking for ways of pushing other people out of the tent and understand that you’re going to get different views within the party.”\n \n\n   \n  Several Democratic voters expressed concern with how the Trump administration has approached immigration.\n \n\n   \n  “I have a special place in my heart for all immigrants and people trying to make their lives better,” said Jennifer Suarez, who cited immigration and education as her top issues after voting on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Suarez, the daughter of Cuban immigrants, said it was “disappointing” to see the Latino community shift toward Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like folks that … climb the ladder and cut it down below them, and I’m not about that life. My family’s not about that life,” said Suarez, a Democrat living in Clifton who voted for Sherrill. “You want a better world for the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Juan Arroyo, a retired teacher from Passaic who immigrated from Peru, said he’s “nervous” the Latino community in New Jersey could boost Republicans again and argued the GOP’s rhetoric about immigrants is damaging.\n \n\n   \n  “The campaign of the other party is coming with a lot of trash talk and people lately are going for that,” said Arroyo, who has run for school board and voted for Sherrill. “Saying that Hispanic people came to this country because they just want to grab jobs from other people and stuff, and that’s not true.”\n \n\n   \n    Monitoring votes in Passaic\n \n\n   \n  Passaic will be one of the most closely watched counties in the state as votes are counted next week. Latino voters in the county could help determine whether Democrats extend control in governor’s office for a third straight term or whether a Republican aligned with Trump’s agenda will lead the state.\n \n\n   \n  The race has already attracted attention from the Trump administration. On Friday, the Department of Justice announced it will  monitor polling sites  in Passaic County — along with five counties in California, where redistricting is on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  The New Jersey Republican State Committee asked US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon to send election monitors to the county, alleging a “long and sordid history” of vote-by-mail fraud.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who leads the state’s voter protection initiative, criticized the DOJ’s move, saying his team is “considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our election.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Department of Justice’s announcement that it is sending federal ‘election monitors’ to Passaic County is highly inappropriate, and DOJ has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions,” Platkin said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jeff Simon contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/apple-worth-4-trillion","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"09:44:00-04:00","title":"Apple Surpasses $4 Trillion in Market Value, Joining Tech Giants in Elite Club","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple has officially surpassed $4 trillion in market value, joining Nvidia and Microsoft as one of the few publicly traded companies to achieve this milestone.

CNN\n \n   \n  Apple   has just joined an exclusive club: It just became one of the few publicly traded companies to surpass $4 trillion in market value, joining fellow tech giants Nvidia and Microsoft, both of which reached that milestone earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) rose 0.1% Tuesday, continuing a sharp rebound, buoyed by strong iPhone 17 sales – including in China, a key market where the company has previously underperformed.\n \n\n   \n  The trend is a reversal of Apple’s fortunes from earlier this year, when the company’s stock tumbled as it navigated a myriad of challenges, from President Donald Trump’s tariffs to AI product delays and pressure to build its smartphones domestically. It  lost over $310 billion  in market value in one trading day in April.\n \n\n   \n  But the tech juggernaut’s rebound can be taken as a sign that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company falls behind in the AI race. Still, Apple shares are up just over 7% this year, a far cry from the 30.7% gain it saw in 2024, and less than the 17% broader-market gain.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s new record comes in a blockbuster year for tech stocks as the AI frenzy has sent tech giants soaring to new heights.\n \n\n   \n  That Nvidia, a critical AI chip provider; and Microsoft, a major player in the cloud market, beat Apple to $4 trillion underscores just how important AI has become to Wall Street. Record-breaking valuations have historically been Apple’s territory.\n \n\n   \n  The company in August 2018 became the first publicly traded company to reach a  $1 trillion valuation.  In August 2020, it became the  first $2 trillion company,  then crossed the  $3 trillion threshold  in January 2022 – but didn’t  close at that level  until June 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street has been eager to cash in on the technology that some believe could be as foundational as the smartphone or the internet, with AI playing a bigger role in everything from office work to health care and education.\n \n\n   \n  For now, however, the iPhone continues to propel Apple to new heights.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s clear to us that (CEO Tim) Cook & Co. has finally found success with iPhone 17 and now the Street awaits for the grand strategic AI roadmap to be unveiled,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an Oct. 20 note.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/economy/bessent-soybean-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"A ‘soybean farmer’ himself, Treasury Sec.

Among them: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m actually a soybean farmer,” Bessent said over the weekend in an ABC News interview. “I have felt this pain, too,” he told Martha Raddatz.\n \n\n   \n  China, usually the largest buyer of American soybeans by far, significantly increased tariffs on the legumes in May after President Donald Trump enacted import levies on Chinese goods. Since then, China hasn’t purchased any American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  But the pain from that de facto boycott might not be shared equally. Many soybean farmers rely on their crops for most of their income. That doesn’t appear to be the case for Bessent, whom  Forbes  estimates has a net worth of around $600 million.\n \n\n   \n    Bessent, the farmer?\n \n\n   \n  Bessent owns farmland that grows soybeans and corn across North Dakota. The land is valued at between $5 million and $25 million and generates an annual income of between $100,000 and $1 million, according to financial disclosure forms he submitted ahead of his confirmation hearing and which were amended in May.\n \n\n   \n  That income comes “through a revenue sharing agreement, which is tied to the price of the crops produced,” his financial disclosure form states.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of Government Ethics has given Bessent until December 15 to divest from the farmland, among other assets he disclosed that are considered to be potential conflicts of interest.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, just 4% of my required divestitures remain, much of which is farmland, an inherently highly illiquid asset,” Bessent said in a statement provided to CNN. At the same time, his efforts to sell soybean-producing farmland could be hindered by the current trade climate that’s pushed soybean prices down.\n \n\n   \n  “While any amount of money is immaterial compared with the honor of serving the American people, the Secretary has written off or experienced opportunity losses of nearly $100 million since assuming office,” a Treasury spokesperson added in a statement to CNN. “As mutually agreed upon between the Secretary, Treasury Ethics, and OGE, he looks forward to being in full compliance by December 15th.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We might have lost our soybean market’\n \n\n   \n  Jake Benike, 36, who grows corn and soybeans with his father, Gary, on their family’s 1,700-acre farm in Elgin, Minnesota, is contemplating a departure from the business too, but for far different reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Despite losing Chinese customers, Benike said he didn’t get “completely hammered” because favorable weather gave them more bushels to sell elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  “But now we’re making decisions for next year, and it’s like, ‘Did we lose our market?’” he said. “If this is what the new price is going to be … it’s not very appealing to try to grow these beans.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision whether to continue growing soybeans, as his family has for the past six decades, largely hinges on the outcome of a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week, Benike’s wife, Beth, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent, who  met with Chinese trade negotiators  over the weekend, said, “I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public, that our soybean farmers will feel very good about what’s going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years.”\n \n\n   \n  That couldn’t be further from how Benike is feeling now. “We might have lost our soybean market,” he said. “I might be telling my grandkids that I used to grow soybeans and now that’s just something that South America does.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/elon-musk-politics-tesla-ev-sales-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-04:00","title":"Elon Musk’s politics cost his firm Tesla more than one million EV sales, report reveals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study by Yale University economists, published through the National Bureau of Economic Research, reveals that Elon Musk’s increasingly partisan political actions—such as his $300 million in Republican donations and leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency under Donald Trump—have significantly hurt Tesla’s U.S. sales from October 2022 to April 2025.

A few words from the Fed chair can move markets and shift billions of dollars. It’s a role so consequential that President Donald Trump has even mused about taking it for himself.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. Trump has, at various points, said he would fire Powell or force him to resign; berated him for not lowering interest rates; and called on the Fed’s Board of Governors to oust him. Now, finally, Trump has an opportunity to reshape the central bank in his own image — and he is seizing it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is expected to name his pick for a replacement as soon as December. That would be the earliest any president has announced a Fed chair nominee before the incumbent steps down.\n \n\n   \n  It could result in a scenario in which months go by with dueling narratives on the US economy, one dictated by Powell and the other by Trump’s nominee, who would be considered the  “shadow Fed chair.” \n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the administration’s search, said he interviewed about a dozen candidates around Labor Day, but said Monday he has narrowed it down to five people. Their backgrounds include the White House, the Fed, and the private sector.\n \n\n   \n  The deliberations remain fluid, according to people familiar with the matter, and the decision is ultimately up to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever Trump picks will be subject to confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate, and will lead the central bank as it juggles competing priorities after the administration’s sweeping economic policies raised the risk of higher inflation and weaker economic growth. Fed policymakers are  currently divided  on how Trump’s policies are affecting the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s who’s who on the administration’s short list for the top job at the Fed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/amazon-layoffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:39:00-04:00","title":"Amazon Just Cut 14,000 Jobs, and It’s Not Done","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amazon announced a plan to cut 14,000 corporate jobs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to become more agile and efficient in response to the rise of artificial intelligence.

But the company also said it wasn’t done with layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains,” said Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience in a memo to employees that the company put on its  public blog .\n \n\n   \n   Reuters , which on Monday first reported Amazon would lay off staff, said the job cuts could ultimately reach 30,000.\n \n\n   \n  Galetti said Amazon needs to operate more leanly to achieve CEO Andy Jassy’s vision of operating like the world’s biggest startup. Jassy wants the company to remain nimble so it can adapt and  change quickly as AI upends the technology sector .\n \n\n   \n  “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti said. “We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”\n \n\n   \n  Amazon has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024  survey  filed to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so the cuts represent about 4% of the company’s overall staff.\n \n\n   \n  Layoffs will begin Tuesday. Most employees will be given 90 days to look for new roles internally, while people that can’t get new jobs at Amazon will be given severance pay and additional benefits.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Jassy said in a separate blog post to employees that efficiency gains from artificial intelligence would allow the company to eventually have a reduced human workforce.\n \n\n   \n  “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he bluntly admitted in a previous note.\n \n\n   \n  Al won’t just effect change at Amazon, Jassy said. AI “will change how we all work and live,” including “billions” of AI agents “across every company and in every imaginable field.” However, much of this remains speculative.\n \n\n   \n  “Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast,” Jassy said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first round of massive layoffs for the tech giant. In 2023, the  company cut 27,000 workers  in its human resources department, Amazon Stores, Amazon Web Services and other divisions. At the time, Jassy attributed the job cuts to a worsening global economic outlook.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s cuts are the latest in a long line of efforts to make Amazon more efficient and focused, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a note to investors Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets across the world are tightening at the same time as underlying costs are rising,” Saunders said. “Amazon is not immune to this, and it needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom line performance. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.”\n \n\n   \n  The cuts come as the US job market has showed warning signs for months,  especially for young tech workers . There have been widespread concerns that generative AI could eventually replace many human workers as  companies  cut costs through greater automation. However, AI experts  say  a lot of these fears aren’t backed by substantial research.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional context and developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/soccer-world-cup-messi-play-2026-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:42:00-04:00","title":"Lionel Messi Aims to Play 2026 FIFA World Cup, If 100% Healthy","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lionel Messi, the 38-year-old Argentine football icon and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, has expressed his hope to participate in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, though he stresses that his decision will be based entirely on his health and daily physical assessment.

 \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Prunella Scales, the actress best known for playing Sybil Fawlty in 1970s British comedy series  “Fawlty Towers,”  has died, her family told the UK’s PA Media news agency Tuesday. She was 93.\n \n\n   \n  Her family said in the statement that Scales “died peacefully at home in London” Monday. She had been watching “Fawlty Towers” the day before, they added.\n \n\n   \n  Widely considered one of the funniest TV shows of all time, “Fawlty Towers” starred Scales as the long-suffering wife of Basil Fawlty (played by  John Cleese ) – a rude hotel manager who forever appeared to be on the brink of a nervous breakdown.\n \n\n   \n  The show, which ran in two six-part series, in 1975 and 1979, was a huge hit in Britain and went on to become a cult classic in the United States. Scales’ catchphrase was simply her husband’s name – Basil – which she screeched at every opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  Born Prunella Margaret Rumney Illingworth on June 6, 1932, Scales took her mother’s maiden name as her stage name. She studied at the Old Vic Theatre School in London, followed by the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York.\n \n\n   \n  Scales, who was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1992 Queen’s Birthday Honours List for her services to drama, married fellow British actor Timothy West in 1963. The couple had two sons, Joe and Samuel – the latter also an actor and director, who starred alongside his mother in the 1992 triple Oscar-winner “Howard’s End.”\n \n\n   \n  Besides “Fawlty Towers,” Scales’ many screen credits included roles in the 1978 thriller “The Boys from Brazil,” which starred Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier, and 1994’s “Wolf,” alongside Jack Nicholson.\n \n\n   \n  In later life, Scales and her husband appeared on screen together in “Great Canal Journeys,” a documentary series for UK broadcaster Channel 4. In the first episode, which aired in 2014, the couple revealed that Scales suffered from a “slight condition,” which turned out to be dementia.\n \n\n   \n  During the  episode , Scales said: “Well, it can be a nuisance sometimes but it doesn’t stop me remembering how to open a lock gate or make the skipper a cup of tea.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair explored the waterways, both in Britain and around the world, for 10 seasons across five years until 2019.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the  UK’s Times newspaper  in December 2021, her son Samuel said: “My mother’s dementia was an open secret in some parts of the profession. Then, when it became known publicly, it became important and desirable for us to treat mild dementia with honesty and as part of the series, particularly because it didn’t seem to affect her enjoyment of what she was doing very much.”\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, West, died in November last year.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 2009, Scales did an interview with  The Times  to mark the 30th anniversary of “Fawlty Towers.” She told the interviewer: “I want to die on the eighth curtain call. I want to go on working till the day I drop.”\n \n\n   \n  Her family said Tuesday: “Although dementia forced her retirement from a remarkable acting career of nearly 70 years, she continued to live at home.”\n \n\n   \n  They added: “She is survived by two sons and one stepdaughter, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. We would like to thank all those who gave Pru such wonderful care at the end of her life: her last days were comfortable, contented and surrounded by love.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/style/naima-green-pregnancy-motherhood-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:13:00-04:00","title":"Donning a fake bump, a photographer blurs fiction and reality in an intimate exploration of motherhood","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Naima Green, a photographer and teacher, creates a powerful and introspective body of work titled 'Instead, I spin fantasies' at the International Center of Photography in New York.

motherhood \n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:13 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After Naima Green married her wife and fellow artist, Sable Elyse Smith, suddenly it seemed as if everyone in their orbit was curious if a baby would follow.\n \n\n   \n  As a teacher, Green loves children, and she has often photographed pregnant friends and new parents as a gesture for her next chapter. But she is ambivalent about having kids of her own, she explained during a phone interview.  Like many people her age, she’s gone back and forth on the reality of it, from what would happen to the life and artistic practice she’s built in New York, to how realistic it would be to conceive. Three years ago, at age 32, a doctor told her she should have begun trying years earlier, which was somewhat unactionable advice without a time machine.\n \n\n   \n  Still, she felt a pull toward pregnancy she didn’t quite understand: “Is it about having a child that I’m raising for the rest of my life, or is about this fixation on what people’s bodies go through?”\n \n\n   \n  Like many artists who have roleplayed different versions of their lives, Green considered turning the camera on herself. She purchased a 20-pound artificial silicone baby bump — which she soon “shoved in a closet,” she noted, unsure of exactly how to use it,  until she met with the curator Elisabeth Sherman for coffee and began to discuss ideas around a larger body of work.\n \n\n   \n  Over a year later, that work, curated by Sherman, is on view at the International Center of Photography in New York as an exploratory show around pregnancy and parenthood, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. Titled “ Instead, I spin fantasies ,” the mix of self-portraits and portraits of friends and loved ones is often diaristic, with sunlit photos of happy, expectant couples; new parents with their children; and intimate third-trimester portraits interspersed with scenes of Green navigating an imagined pregnancy. In the show, Green assembles a wide swath of photos depicting different versions of family and community, and often touches on the expected social structures and pressures of parenthood.\n \n\n   \n  “What, to me, feels very critical of this work is that I’m not trying to point to the solution, or say, ‘here is how it’s done,’” she explained. “I’m trying to explore a very expansive picture across different geographies, different classes, different ideas of family, just as a way of seeing, understanding or creating different possibilities for family-making.”\n \n\n   \n    Different pathways\n \n\n   \n  Green is interested in non-traditional forms of family and child raising, particularly living in a city where people often seem to follow the same formula: couples who meet and start a family in the city, then move out to suburbs and start new lives, often with limited help from family and friends. Even among her queer friends, who have likeminded, expansive ideas around community and family, the proverbial village hasn’t always been there.\n \n\n   \n  “I was talking to a new friend who has a toddler, and she was talking about how, even as a queer person, that the community aspect is not as fluid as she would have imagined it to be,” Green said. “There’s this idea that your nuclear family has to be able to self-sustain. But the people I’ve made a life with — my friends, my partner — I would want all of those things to extend into having a child, and to really think about it as a community effort.”\n \n\n   \n  She added: “It’s not something that I want to do in isolation, and I think that is something that’s deeply American, that it can feel very isolating. And I don’t think it has to be.”\n \n\n   \n  Through her self-portraits, Green hints at the different expectations of motherhood. In one shoot, she poses in vibrant faux family portraits with a fictional father, played by fellow artist DonChristian. In another, she sits in a kiddie pool, a video camera obscuring her face, musing on the monetization of motherhood, and how “intimate family moments become a part of a brand.” In other images, she toys with the taboo: a lit joint in her fingers, or nearby cigarette butts in frame.\n \n\n   \n  Smith, her wife, makes occasional appearances but is a presence behind the scenes, too, setting up the shots or helping Green into the prosthetic belly. In a hotel room in Philadelphia, where Green is originally from, Smith took a high-flash portrait of Green against a wall in a rolled-up black tee-shirt, the belly’s visible seams and pale coloring breaking the fourth wall. Green said that she had trouble finding a prosthetic that matched her skin tone, adding another layer to the work by questioning “who we envision as being a mother.”\n \n\n   \n    Heavy expectations\n \n\n   \n  As Green developed the work further, conversations with friends stayed on her mind — people who had told her that pregnancy was the only time they felt that they could stop thinking about body image and thinness; others who followed time-intensive diets and niche advice, or shirked traditional literature on motherhood completely.\n \n\n   \n  “People reach for the things that make them feel the most in control in a really kind of wild time,” she said. “And who am I to say that it’s wrong or right for that person? But culturally, we have so many opinions on what mothers and pregnant people are supposed to do and how they’re supposed to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Green says the series will continue to be ongoing. As she’s made more connections and opened up discussions in the course of making the work, she feels “a greater sense of possibility” about what community and family can be. Recently, she began making early plans with a close friend who is planning to become pregnant.\n \n\n   \n  “I said to her, ‘Well, I would love to be part of those very early days with you. I could come live with you for a month, or six weeks,’ and be part of the process of someone raising a child, even though that child is not mine,” she recalled. “But to be deeply rooted in community means that we are all responsible for you and your baby’s well-being. And that felt really exciting to me, because I think that’s not often the way I hear people thinking about friendship when they bring their children home.” She added: “I’m definitely interested in a vision that invites more trusted people into the life of the child.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/world/who-was-austin-tice-journalist-syria-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"06:26:00-04:00","title":"American Journalist Austin Tice Vanished in Syria 13 Years Ago; His Mother Still Searches for Him","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Austin Tice, an American journalist and former Marine, vanished in Syria in 2012 while covering the civil war.

His mother never stopped searching for him \n       \n  By Rob Picheta, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “This is either gonna be wildly successful or a complete disaster,”  Austin Tice  wrote in May 2012, on the eve of a dangerous journey to bear witness to history. “Here goes nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice, a physically towering former Marine and fledgling journalist, threw himself with grit and resolve into war zones, friendships and the injustices he cared deeply about.\n \n\n   \n  But he is yet to return from that journey. Tice disappeared in Syria two months after setting off to cover the country’s crippling civil war, sparking a 13-year mystery that has tortured his Texan family and plagued Washington’s relationship with Syria’s brutal former dictator, Bashar al-Assad.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a decade, nobody has seen or heard from Tice. His family has never lost hope that he is alive, even as successive administrations – from President Obama to President Trump – failed to bring him home.\n \n\n   \n  But in December, Assad’s repressive regime – which had always denied capturing or killing Tice – collapsed in an instant. And in the chaotic months since, clues about Tice’s fate have begun to seep through the walls of Syria’s once-impenetrable prisons and palaces.\n \n\n   \n  Now,  a CNN investigation  has revealed a remarkable development. Bassam al Hassan, a four-star general close to Assad, told CNN’s chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward that Tice was killed in 2013, the year after his capture.  The order came from Assad, he said . But Hassan failed an FBI polygraph test, CNN has confirmed, and it is unclear which parts of his story remain a lie.\n \n\n   \n  “Austin is like a bridge between America and Syria,” Waseem Enawi, a Syrian activist who hosted Tice in his home in Yabrud for three weeks, told CNN. “Through what happened to Austin, people can understand what happened to hundreds of thousands of Syrians,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the only good thing I can think of to come out of all of this.”\n \n\n   \n  The oldest of seven siblings, Tice was home-schooled by his devoted Catholic parents, Debra and Mark Tice, in Houston. The family loved to travel; they would visit Mexico at least one a year, took several cross-country road trips, and spent three months in Europe while Austin was a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really important for my parents that we knew that there was a whole world out there,” Abigail Tice, Austin’s youngest sister, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Tice was fiercly protective, Abigail remembered. “Whenever I would have a high school crush, he would talk to them and (say): ‘That’s my little sister, you better treat her with respect.’”\n \n\n   \n  When Abigail’s daughter was born, Austin became a “huge, loving teddy bear,” Abigail told CNN. “Every single moment that he could, he was playing with her.”\n \n\n   \n  At 23, Tice joined the Marines. “I think he saw the Marines as the greatest challenge,” said Brian Bruggeman, Austin’s battalion commander during his deployment to Afghanistan in 2011. “Austin was attracted to the way the Marines lead.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice stood out, Bruggeman told CNN. “He was gregarious and extremely curious.”\n \n\n   \n  He worked to assimilate his Afghan interpreter into the battalion, Bruggeman recalled, telling the local translator: “You’re part of our unit now.” A year later, Tice was delighted when the interpreter was accepted to an American college, and the man stayed with Tice’s family in Texas after moving to the US.\n \n\n   \n  In Afghanistan, Tice opened up to his peers. “He let me in,” Bruggeman said. “He loved to talk about his family,” his commander recalled. “I felt like I knew his mom well before I ever met or talked to (her).”\n \n\n   \n  Tice had “an epiphany” while in Afghanistan, Bruggeman added: He wanted to get into photojournalism. He celebrated his 30th birthday by buying a camera and began documenting his deployment, sharing his stream of consciousness on blogs and on Twitter.\n \n\n   \n  But Tice’s time in Afghanistan changed him in darker ways, too. He saw several fellow Marines killed or injured: One lost his left leg when an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated, and another was fatally electrocuted when his radio antenna touched a power line. He developed a morbid sense of humor about his own vulnerability.\n \n\n   \n  “Heading out soon on a horribly conceived mission,” he wrote in one tweet. “Hopefully (it) will be forgotten like most dumb missions are; otherwise, see you on CNN.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve served on the front lines of both our wars,” he wrote at another point, referring also to his service in Iraq. “Aside from my men, I have yet to see anything worth dying for.”\n \n\n   \n  But becoming a lawyer wasn’t his calling, and being dull wasn’t his nature.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the path I saw for him,” a family friend of the Tices told CNN. “He was too much a person of action to sit behind a desk.”\n \n\n   \n  So, after his second year of law school, Tice set his eyes on a new mission. And he wanted his brother to join him.\n \n\n   \n  “I slipped into an empty room at the little house we were renting and listened, astonished, as he told me he was planning a trip to Syria that summer of 2012,” Jacob Tice wrote in  a 2020 opinion piece  for CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Jacob turned him down because he couldn’t imagine traveling to an active war zone. But he wrote: “I encouraged him to follow his heart and to bear witness to the escalating conflict in Syria. I believed in his vision, admired his grit and was behind him completely.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice understood the risks. He had a long-running streak with a close colleague in the online game Words With Friends, and he made a deal: If I don’t play my turn for more than a week, let people know I’m in trouble.\n \n\n   \n  The night before he left for Syria, Tice met his family friend in a DC bar. “There was no talking him out of this,” the friend told CNN. “He wanted to tell their story. Because he felt like nobody else was there.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think about that evening all the time,” added Tice’s friend, who asked not to be identified. “If I could have, if I could have stopped him.”\n \n\n   \n  “God damn it, I wish I’d said the right thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice stayed with Enawi near the country’s northern border for nearly three weeks, interviewing locals about the war. “Everyone (was) saying hello to him – he was a little bit famous,” Enawi told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Tice wasn’t a reporter yet, but he didn’t want to waste time. “He desperately wanted to be a journalist. He wanted to be a success,” Liz Sly, a Beirut bureau editor at the Washington Post who worked with Tice and published three of his stories, told CNN. He wanted to learn by doing – and he was good at it.\n \n\n   \n  “Lots of people struggle to write a news story. They don’t get it,” Sly said. “He didn’t seem to struggle at all. He seemed a natural.”\n \n\n   \n  But Tice was raw, and a growing cast of seasoned journalists worked to hone his restless energy. David Enders, who traveled with Tice through Syria for several weeks and worked with him on a series of stories for McClatchy, told CNN: “One of the first things I said to him was, ‘if you tweet our location in real time, you will never see me again.’”\n \n\n   \n  Tice and Enders embedded with a rebel unit and raced towards Damascus, sleeping in safehouses with their boots on and carrying only what they could run with. They jumped on makeshift buses and on the back of motorbikes and sometimes walked, evading government shelling and helicopters as they went.\n \n\n   \n  “I am embedded w  #FSA . Newsworthy stuff going on daily,” Tice tweeted in late May. “If someone wanted to hire me that would be great. Student loans don’t pay themselves.”\n \n\n   \n  On one occasion, a tank shell hit the front of a house the pair were taking cover behind, Enders said. “I don’t have any recollection of (the) sound,” he said. “I remember the impact, and hitting the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  It was more violent action than Tice had seen in the military, according to Enders. But the pair bonded over their profession and their recent divorces, and Tice would often share stories about his family. Once he interrupted a conversation among rebel fighters to tell them their plan to ambush a government convoy wasn’t well-planned enough.\n \n\n   \n  Tice would subsequently win the George Polk Award for War Reporting, alongside Enders. But the pair eventually parted ways. Rebel forces were gaining control of the suburbs surrounding Damascus, the scene of violent fighting, and Tice wanted to get there in time to see the Assad regime collapse.\n \n\n   \n  “It was extremely, extremely difficult and dangerous – the government was cutting off supply lines and transit routes,” Enders said. At one point he broke free of a rebel safehouse and started walking towards the city, until the rebel fighters retrieved him and locked him in a room for his own safety.\n \n\n   \n  Tice called Sly to vent his frustration. “He was so convinced Assad was going to fall,” she said. “And he had to be there for it.”\n \n\n   \n  The year ended with Tice unwinding at a pool party with FSA rebels, according to  a post  from him in the early hours of August 12. Taylor Swift’s music blared in the background; Tice was an unabashed Swift fan. “Hands down, best birthday ever,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That was the last tweet he’d send. In Beirut, Sly heard from an editor at the Post, where Tice had filed a fourth dispatch. “Austin hasn’t answered his questions,” the editor told Sly. “He always does. Have you heard from him?”\n \n\n   \n  It took a few days for concern to set in. Tice had been planning some R&R, and perhaps he was on his way to Lebanon or Turkey to take a break.\n \n\n   \n  But as the days passed, it became clear that Tice had been captured. Sly, Enders and the other journalists Tice had befriended during his rapid professional rise frantically reached out to their contacts, but nobody knew what had happened to him.\n \n\n   \n  Back home, the Tices were on a family vacation in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Austin had been in contact throughout his time in Syria – he knew his siblings and his parents were worried about him – so it didn’t take long for something to feel off.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s one of those moments in our family’s history where there’s a before and there’s an after,” Abigail told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  They cut the trip short, and over the ensuing weeks, the phone on their wall in Houston never stopped ringing. Media members quickly converged outside their house. It was overwhelming, Abigail said.\n \n\n   \n  Both Sly and Enders had nightmares about their colleague. “There was one where he was in a forest, and people were shooting at him, and I had to warn him,” Sly remembered.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in September, a video appeared on YouTube. The  shaky footage  showed Tice, blindfolded, weeks after his disappearance. He recited a garbled prayer in Arabic, then added, in English: “Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.” The video apparently showed him surrounded by jihadi militants, but the US quickly reached the conclusion that it had been staged by forces loyal to Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Marc Tice, Austin’s father, said in a statement at the time that seeing the video was “difficult,” but “knowing Austin is alive and well is comforting to our family.”\n \n\n   \n  No footage of Tice has been seen since, but the family never lost that hope.\n \n\n   \n  “We know he’s alive and we know that eventually he will be home and our family will be together again,” Abigail said. “We’ve never doubted it once.”\n \n\n   \n  Austin’s disappearance transformed his mother, Debra, into a geopolitical crusader overnight. She has met with successive US Presidents and told CNN earlier this year that President Trump’s team started reaching out to her soon after his election victory last November, describing their work on the case as “fantastic.”\n \n\n   \n  As time has worn on, his mother’s resolve has only grown. “Debra Tice is a force of nature,” the longtime family friend told CNN. “This woman’s singular focus in life is amazing, and it’s inspiring.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, in December, came renewed hope. Assad’s regime dramatically and decisively fell to rebel fighters, twelve years after Austin Tice believed it would. In the days that followed, Debra wrote a letter to several leaders – including Russian President Vladimir Putin – who gave the fallen despot sanctuary after he fled Syria.\n \n\n   \n  Her letter elicited a public response from Putin, who  said at his end-of-year press conference  that he would talk to Assad about Tice’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve never seen somebody with the guts to stand up to any world leader, to anyone, to say the things that she has said to people to try and get her son out,” the Tices’ family friend said.\n \n\n   \n  Thirteen years after he vanished, Austin Tice’s fate may never truly be known. His disappearance still haunts those who knew him. It changed Sly’s approach to hiring freelancers — “You can’t just take people (who) bound into the country with no background or experience,” she told CNN. She also asks herself: “Could we have done more?”\n \n\n   \n  But Tice knew he was dancing with danger, and those close to him all acknowledge one thing: Once he set his heart on something, trying to change his mind was impossible.\n \n\n   \n  “Every person in this country fighting for their freedom wakes up every day and goes to sleep every night with the knowledge that death could visit them at any moment. They accept that reality as the price of freedom,”  Tice wrote  on Facebook less than three weeks before his disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  “No, I don’t have a death wish - I have a life wish,” he continued. “Coming here to Syria is the greatest thing I’ve ever done, and it’s the greatest feeling of my life.”\n \n\n   \n   Clarissa Ward, CNN’s chief international correspondent,  contributed to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/football-nfl-week-8-chiefs-commanders-mnf-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"05:58:00.000Z","title":"Patrick Mahomes overcomes worst game start in his career to lead Chiefs to victory over Commanders on Monday Night Football","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Patrick Mahomes overcame the worst start to a game in his NFL career — throwing two interceptions on the first two drives — to lead the Kansas City Chiefs to a 28-7 victory over the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football.

\n  Patrick Mahomes overcame the worst start to a game in his storied career to lead the  Kansas City Chiefs  to a 28-7  victory  over the Washington Commanders on  Monday Night Football .\n \n\n   \n  Mahomes threw two interceptions on the first two Chiefs drives of Monday’s game, the first time that’s happened during his time in the  NFL .\n \n\n   \n  But after that slow start – Kansas City head coach Andy Reid called the first half “weird” – Mahomes and the Chiefs offense seemed to click into gear at Arrowhead Stadium.\n \n\n   \n  A one-yard touchdown run from Kareem Hunt broke the deadlock with 5:46 left in the second quarter before the Commanders leveled the score with back-up QB Marcus Mariota connecting with Terry McLaurin. In the second half, Kansas City scored 21 unanswered points to romp to a comfortable victory.\n \n\n   \n  Mahomes ended the game with 299 passing yards and three touchdown throws – one apiece to Travis Kelce, Rashee Rice and Hunt – and explained that, after a slow start to the  year , the Chiefs as a whole are improving.\n \n\n   \n  “It shows the growth that we’ve had as a team,” the 30-year-old told reporters. “Offense, defense and special teams, I think we’re getting better and better each and every week.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though we didn’t start the way we wanted to today offensively, it showed that we can battle through adversity and still continue to play the brand of football that we want to play. We’ll have to continue to get better and better.”\n \n\n   \n  The victory was the Chiefs’ fifth win in their last six games as they surge back from an 0-2 start to the season.\n \n\n   \n  The team now boasts a healthy compliment of offensive weapons for Mahomes to target, with all of Kelce, Rice, Xavier Worthy and Marquise Brown providing different aspects for the team to utilize.\n \n\n   \n  The return of Worthy from an injury and Rice from a  six-game suspension  has allowed Kelce to thrive with the space those speedy receivers make for him.\n \n\n   \n  The 36-year-old had six catches for 99 yards and a touchdown against Washington and is back to providing an important safety blanket target for Mahomes.\n \n\n   \n  His score on Monday was his 83rd total NFL touchdown, tied with Priest Holmes for the most in Chiefs franchise history. It was also his 80th career touchdown catch, becoming just the  fifth tight end  in league history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  The Chiefs, now with a 5-3 record, face a difficult few weeks of games which will prove if they are truly back to their best. They first travel to play the Buffalo Bills in Week 9 and then after a bye, go to Colorado to meet their AFC West rivals, the Denver Broncos, and then host the high-flying Indianapolis Colts.\n \n\n   \n  “This is going to be a great challenge this next week and we’ll have to start faster,” Mahomes said, “but I was proud of how the guys responded in that second half.”\n \n\n   \n  For the Commanders, they slip to 3-5 having had to play for the third time this season without starting quarterback Jayden Daniels through injury.\n \n\n   \n  Daniels missed Monday’s game with a hamstring injury and, in his absence, Mariota struggled to move the offense consistently, throwing one touchdown but two interceptions.\n \n\n   \n  The run game also suffered in Daniels’ absence, with the team only able to rack up 60 yards on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  Having lost in the NFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles last year, it’s a disappointing campaign for Washington but getting its star second-year quarterback healthy again will be the top priority.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/new-york-california-housing-nimby","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"New York and California are taking on the NIMBYs","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York City and California are undergoing significant reforms to address their housing affordability crises by changing zoning laws to speed up affordable housing development and reduce NIMBYism.

 \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York City voters are currently deciding on one of the most polarizing issues in decades. But it has nothing to do with 34-year-old democratic socialist mayoral frontrunner  Zohran Mamdani. \n \n\n   \n  Instead, it will determine who has the power to greenlight — or block— affordable housing development in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Several  proposals  on the ballot could speed up affordable housing development and land use approvals in the city. The proposals have pitted the City Council against the mayor, and developers against unions. The fight is symbolic of a larger power struggle playing out in liberal cities and states like New York and California. Despite championing inclusion, these places are some of the most unaffordable in America and have policies that empower local voices to block affordable housing, often called NIMBYism “Not In My Backyard.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone wants new housing, but no one wants it on their block,” said David Schleicher, a Yale University professor of property and urban law.\n \n\n   \n    Power to block housing\n \n\n   \n  One ballot proposal in New York City would speed up review for affordable housing developments in the neighborhoods that have built the fewest. Another would remove a local city council member’s ability to kill a housing project.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of these reforms say zoning laws have been hijacked by NIMBYs, and control should be shifted away from local leaders to cities and states. Local government is typically most responsive to vocal, well-funded homeowners who oppose affordable buildings on their blocks over fears their property values will decline or strain school systems.\n \n\n   \n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and affordable housing advocates back the ballot measures. The proposals   build on recent city  zoning code changes  to add more housing, such as making it easier to build accessory dwelling units (ADUs) like garages and basement apartments or converting office buildings into apartments.\n \n\n   \n  But City Council members say the proposals silence neighborhood voices, and labor unions say they weaken important checks on real estate developers.\n \n\n   \n  The ballot measures come as New York City faces one of the worst housing affordability crises in its history. Median rents have hit nearly  $5,000 a month  in Manhattan, and vacancy rates have fallen to a record low of 1.4%.\n \n\n   \n  A similar reckoning is playing out in California over policies that made it difficult to build housing, contributing to  sky-high rents .\n \n\n   \n  California rolled back its  landmark environmental law  earlier this year, which had given neighborhoods and groups a powerful tool to sue to stop housing development.\n \n\n   \n  California also passed legislation this month permitting apartment buildings near major rail and bus stations around the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the law over fierce pushback from some local governments.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to have multi-story apartment towers in residential neighborhoods,”  said  Los Angeles City Councilwoman Traci Park. “This is an effort to Manhattan-ize Los Angeles.”\n \n\n   \n    Sea change on zoning\n \n\n   \n  California and New York City’s recent reforms would have once been unthinkable.\n \n\n   \n  During the 1960s and 1970s, those states helped galvanize a movement to establish local control over development. It grew as a response to unchecked urban renewal programs that demolished historic neighborhoods, such as Robert Moses’  highway projects  in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  But local rules designed to preserve neighborhoods now stifle housing development, reformers say.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco build housing at some of the slowest rates of major cities in the country. Over the past decade, New York City added just 30.6 housing units per 1,000 residents — far fewer than Atlanta or Miami’s roughly 140 housing units — according to NYU’s Furman Center data.\n \n\n   \n  Recent reforms have been propelled by activists who believe it’s hypocritical for liberal bastions to call for equality while blocking affordable housing.\n \n\n   \n  “In jurisdictions that are going to block new housing, the whole game is to use the power of the state to take away their ability to say no,” said Matthew Lewis, the communications director for California YIMBY, a housing reform group. “You’ve got a new cohort of activists and generations who can’t own a home because cities have put up these barriers.”\n \n\n   \n    No silver bullet\n \n\n   \n  New York City and California are joining a  wave of cities and states  that are changing zoning laws to speed up development amid the nationwide housing shortage.\n \n\n   \n  States governed by both Democrats and Republicans — including Florida, Montana and Washington — have enacted reforms like eliminating minimum lot sizes, permitting accessory dwelling units and limiting on-site parking spaces.\n \n\n   \n  “Housing has turned out to be one of the least partisan issues state to state,” said Charles Gardner, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center who studies planning law and housing affordability.\n \n\n   \n  But these changes are not an immediate solution. Rewriting zoning regulations likely won’t help low-and moderate-income residents afford housing for years. A 2023 Urban Institute  study  found that loosening zoning restrictions did not add lower-cost housing units for at least nine years.\n \n\n   \n  Surging building costs also make it harder to offer affordable apartments. The cost of labor and materials in New York, which make up more than 60% of constructing a building, is among the  highest  in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “Awareness has come around on local regulation, but right now that’s not the biggest problem we’re facing,” said Lydia Lo, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute’s housing and communities division. “It can only do so much in an environment where costs are rising so quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  Zoning reforms must be coupled with major subsidies to help people afford new housing, many  researchers  say. This would require huge investments that cities and states on tight budgets are likely unable to make.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not all ponies and rainbows because we did zoning reform,” said Lewis from California YIMBY. “But the ponies and rainbows are within sight.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/basketball-nba-gambling-probe-policies-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:14:00-04:00","title":"NBA Starts Review of Policies After Gambling-Related Arrests of Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the arrests of Miami guard Terry Rozier and Portland coach Chauncey Billups on federal charges of involvement in a gambling scheme tied to betting on player performance in a March 2023 game, the NBA has launched a comprehensive policy review to strengthen the integrity of its games and protect players and coaches from gambling-related risks. The league detected unusual betting patterns on player stats, including Rozier’s 'unders,' which prompted an internal investigation that did not find sufficient evidence for disciplinary action, yet raised serious concerns about transparency and regulation.

Ted Cruz, the Republican chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on that panel, want information “about how the NBA investigated and handled these allegations as well as what steps the Association is taking to maintain the public’s trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Their specific questions revolve around why the league’s probe of Rozier and the events surrounding a March 23, 2023 game when he was with the Charlotte Hornets.\n \n\n   \n  “This Committee needs to understand the specifics of the NBA’s investigation and why Rozier was cleared to continue playing basketball,” Cruz and Cantwell wrote. “This is a matter of Congressional concern. The integrity of NBA games must be trustworthy and free from the influence of organized crime or gambling-related activity. Sports betting scandals like this one may lead the American public to assume that all sports are corrupt.”\n \n\n   \n  They asked  Commissioner Adam Silver  to provide answers by November 10.\n \n\n   \n   Two indictments  were unsealed last week and nearly three dozen people – most notably, Billups and Rozier – were arrested by federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Rozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance in that March 2023 game. The charges are similar to what former Toronto player  Jontay Porter  faced before he was banned from the league by Silver in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Sportsbooks detected unusual patterns of wagers on the Charlotte game in question – prop bets involving Rozier were flagged and immediately brought to the NBA’s attention – and the league probed the matter but did not find enough evidence to conclude that Rozier broke any rules.\n \n\n   \n  “While the unusual betting on Terry Rozier’s ‘unders’ in the March 2023 game was detected in real time because the bets were placed legally, we believe there is more that can be done from a legal/regulatory perspective to protect the integrity of the NBA and our affiliated leagues,” the league told its teams.\n \n\n   \n  “In particular, proposition bets on individual player performance involve heightened integrity concerns and require additional scrutiny.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s moves comes on the heels of several developments last week, including the  NFL  reminding players of its gambling policy,  MLB  Commissioner Rob Manfred saying that baseball is moving “as fast as we can” on a probe of two players in that sport, and a Congressional committee asking Silver for a briefing by the end of this week to discuss topics including how “gaps, if any, in existing regulations that allow illegal betting schemes to occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Silver has said many times he would prefer federal regulation on sports betting instead of the current state-by-state approach.\n \n\n   \n  It was not clear Monday if Silver would appear before the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which requested the briefing in a letter signed by six members of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Among the things the league said Monday it will take a look at: injury reports. The league publishes an injury report every hour, and teams are required to disclose statuses of players within certain windows of time before their next game. The NBA added the injury report several years ago in the interest of transparency.\n \n\n   \n  The injury statuses can be used by bettors to decide which wagers to make – and if gamblers get that information before the rest of the public, it’s tantamount to insider trading. Former NBA player Damon Jones now faces charges because officials said he tipped off bettors about the health status of two  Los Angeles Lakers  players. The details in that indictment clearly show that Jones was discussing the availability of  LeBron James  and former Lakers center Anthony Davis with bettors before their statuses for certain games was known publicly. There is no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was alleged to be doing.\n \n\n   \n  There were other examples of such tipping with other clubs, federal officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “With sports betting now occupying such a significant part of the current sports landscape, every effort must be made to ensure that players, coaches, and other NBA personnel are fully aware of the dire risks that gambling can impose upon their careers and livelihoods; that our injury disclosure rules are appropriate; and that players are protected from harassment from bettors,” the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  The league also said it is seeking input from teams, if they have any ideas on how to best proceed going forward.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/sport/hockey-nhl-fan-hospitalized-after-fall","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-04:00","title":"Fan at Penguins game hospitalized after falling from upper concourse","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fan fell from the upper concourse at PPG Paints Arena during a Pittsburgh Penguins vs. St. Louis Blues game on October 27, 2025, shortly after Anthony Mantha scored a goal.

lagging immigration arrests, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The White House set a lofty goal of  3,000 daily arrests  earlier this year — a high bar for an agency that’s historically been strained for resources and personnel. And despite ramping up arrests, ICE has largely fallen short of that goal.\n \n\n   \n  That’s fueled tensions between the White House and ICE. Planning has been underway to reassign at least a dozen directors of ICE offices nationwide who senior officials believe are underperforming, the sources said. ICE has 25 field offices.\n \n\n   \n  “While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Since receiving its mass deportation edict after President Donald Trump took office in January, ICE has fielded criticism from people inside the administration who think they  aren’t doing enough , lawmakers and advocates who think they are  doing too much , and an incensed public that in some cases is taking drastic action to  impede immigration enforcement .\n \n\n   \n  To bolster immigration arrests, DHS tapped US Border Patrol agents to fan out across the country. They’ve have been involved in high-profile confrontations with protesters and at the center of some of the administration’s most controversial and aggressive enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  Part of the discussions have involved replacing heads of certain ICE field offices with Border Patrol officials, the sources said, stressing that plans have not been finalized.\n \n\n   \n  At the helm of the immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities is Gregory Bovino, who holds the title of chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector and has been the lead on the administration’s crackdown in cities — now, in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House have touted the work of Bovino and the Border Patrol publicly and privately. There are more than 1,500 Border Patrol agents assisting ICE with immigration enforcement in the interior of the US.\n \n\n   \n  But while ICE and CBP both fall under the Department of Homeland Security and are involved in immigration enforcement, they also execute different functions, raising concerns about potentially replacing some ICE leadership with Border Patrol officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/asia/japan-abductees-north-korea-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00-04:00","title":"With a new leader – and Trump in town – Japanese families whose loved ones were abducted by North Korea have fresh hope","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japanese families of citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s have renewed hope following the appointment of Japan’s new female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump in the region.

Korea have fresh hope \n       \n  By Hilary Whiteman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago, this week is perhaps the best shot they’ve had in years of substantive progress.\n \n\n   \n  Not only does Japan have a new prime minister, but US President Donald Trump is in their part of the world, with unfinished business when it comes to the return of their loved ones.\n \n\n   \n  Japan says  at least 17 of its citizens were snatched  by North Korean agents in the late 1970s and 1980s – alongside hundreds of unexplained cases. Five citizens were returned in 2002; some families are still waiting.   \n \n\n   \n  Pyongyang disputes the total number taken and says some died in traffic and drowning accidents, as well as suicide, and it considers the matter over.\n \n\n   \n  Families met with Trump and new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday and, while holding photos of their lost family members, asked if he’d put their case to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  No Trump-Kim meeting has been formally scheduled, but South Korea’s unification ministry stoked speculation last week, saying North Koreans had been “spotted cleaning, pulling grass, arranging flower beds, pruning and taking photos of the North Korean facilities” at Panmunjom, the peace village inside the demilitarized zone (the DMZ), that separates the two Koreas.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly raised the prospect of an impromptu visit to the DMZ. On Monday as he flew to Japan and told reporters on board Air Force One he was open to extending his Asia trip, which ends in South Korea, for a meeting with Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d love to meet with him if he’d like to meet,” Trump said. “I got along great with Kim Jong Un, I liked him, he liked me, if he wants to meet, I’ll be in South Korea.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked again on Tuesday, he replied: “We’ll see what’s going on”.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Kim last met a the DMZ in 2019, shaking hands across the border in a historic moment hurriedly organized when  Trump posted a speculative invitation  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  It was the first time a sitting US President had set foot on North Korean soil. In the end the meetings produced no substantive breakthrough for either side.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea, which frequently condemns the US in its daily state media missives, certainly hasn’t ruled out a meeting with Trump. Kim said in a speech last month that he had “good memories of President Trump,” according to state media.\n \n\n   \n    An advertorial to appeal to Americans\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously embraced the cause of those who lost their loved ones to North Korea. Tuesday’s meeting was their third since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019,  he stood beside then-leader Shinzo Abe, and said:  “You have a great prime minister. He loves this country. He loves you. And we will be working together to bring your relatives – your daughters, your sons, your mothers – home.”\n \n\n   \n  He repeated similar phrases on Tuesday, telling the families that Takaichi was going to be a “great prime minister.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s my honor to be with you again. And we will do everything within our power,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  But little has happened since Abe left office in 2020 (he was later assassinated in 2022). The issue passed to three more prime ministers, with no real signs of progress.\n \n\n   \n  In March of this year, then-Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba took out  an advertorial in the Washington Post  to inform Americans of the situation and appeal for international support.\n \n\n   \n  In the advertisement, Sakie Yokota, who at 89-years-old is the last surviving parent of an abductee, made a direct appeal to Trump, with a dose of flattery in the hope that the US leader doesn’t abandon them.\n \n\n   \n  “I am greatly counting on the Trump administration because of his strength,” she said. “I fervently hope that President Trump will make a significant push for the abductees’ return home.”\n \n\n   \n  The abductions appear to have been part of North Korea’s espionage program, with a  2014 UN report  finding the abductees “were used to teach the Japanese language, accent and culture to (North Korean) spies in training; to enable the study of Japanese identification documents in order to better falsify them; and allow (North Korean) agents to pass themselves off as being Japanese, using the identity of the abducted person.”\n \n\n   \n    Kidnapped on the way home from school\n \n\n   \n  Yokota’s daughter Megumi is perhaps one of the most well-known of Japan’s abductees. Then 13,  Megumi vanished in 1977  on her way home from school in the coastal city of Niigata.\n \n\n   \n  Photos later emerged showing her in North Korea, where she was known to have married and given birth to a daughter.  In 2014,  Sakie and her husband Shigeru met that child , Kim Eun-gyong, then 26, during a meeting in Mongolia arranged by Japanese and North Korean officials.  North Korean officials had told them that Megumi died in 1994 from suicide, a claim repeated by her daughter.\n \n\n   \n  But the family refuses to believe she is gone. Shigeru died in 2020, leaving his wife to continue the search. Now Sakie hopes Takaichi, as Japan’s first female prime minister, will bring new energy to their quest for answers.\n \n\n   \n  “She is the first female prime minister … I feel that her feelings as a mother may lead her to tackle this issue seriously from a different angle,” Sakie said during a news conference last week.\n \n\n   \n  Hajime Matsumoto, the older brother of Kyoko Matsumoto, who disappeared in 1977 as she was leaving her home to attend a knitting class, said he was also hopeful of progress under Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Until now, only men have become Prime Minister, and many of them say ‘I’ll do it, I’ll do it,’ but then don’t,” said Hajime. “This time, the prime minister is a woman, so I believe she will be persistent and patient, and will probably keep striving until she can meet with the person she needs to meet.” According to the Japanese government,  North Korea denies that Hajime’s sister Kyoko entered its territory – Japan believes otherwise. \n \n\n   \n  Takaichi, an Abe protégé who shares his conservative, hawkish views, met the families last week and says she’s prepared to meet Kim to discuss the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “I myself will exercise leadership in my own way and strive to break through no matter what,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the families of the abductees know that Takaichi is only one part of the puzzle. They hope that she, like Abe, will press Trump to raise their plight with Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope to remind him to convey to Chairman Kim Jong Un in the case of a US-North Korea summit, that things cannot move forward unless the abduction issue is resolved,” said Yokota, who is also head of the Association of Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Kenichi Ichikawa, the older brother of Shuichi Ichikawa, who disappeared with his partner on a beach in 1978, said ultimately, only one man can give them what they want.\n \n\n   \n  “The only one who can return the victims, the family members, is Kim Jong Un.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Riku Inoue, Junko Ogura, Gawon Bae and Betsy Klein contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/us/praneeth-kumar-usiripalli-flight-stabbing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"20:36:00-04:00","title":"Man charged after stabbing two teenagers with a fork on a flight from Chicago to Germany","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 28-year-old Indian national, Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, was charged with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while traveling on an aircraft after stabbing two 17-year-old teenagers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt on October 26, 2025.

According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.\n \n\n   \n  According to Hamdi’s LinkedIn page, he is the managing director and editor-in-chief of International Interest, an organization which “advises on political environments across the globe.”\n \n\n   \n    When was he detained?\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Hamdi had spoken at CAIR’s annual gala in Sacramento, California, and had been due to speak at the gala of CAIR Florida the next day.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR said its lawyers were “working to address this injustice.” and called on ICE to release him.\n \n\n   \n  “Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,” CAIR said.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi’s wife Soumaya told CNN that he has been held for more than 24 hours “without recourse to legal representation or consular assistance.”\n \n\n   \n  “He is effectively being held incommunicado,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if Hamdi has had consular assistance or legal representation, a spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was “in contact with the family of a British man detained in the USA” and “in touch with the local authorities.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 68,000 people and reduced much of the enclave to rubble. Israel says its offensive has targeted Hamas and that it takes measures to avoid killing civilians, but a United Nations inquiry last month  concluded  for the first time that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.”\n \n\n   \n  However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Why now?\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative activist with a direct line to Trump, said Hamdi’s arrest came after her “relentless pressure” on the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a series of posts on X, she claimed Hamdi was “an individual with Islamic terror ties” and a supporter of Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department confirmed it had arrested Hamdi, saying the US will continue to revoke the visas of foreigners who “support terrorism” and make Americans unsafe. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the approach showed common sense.\n \n\n   \n  Loomer called on the Trump administration to take further action against CAIR by revoking its 501(c)(3) status, which makes the nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxes.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR said Loomer, who has  taken credit  for a slew of high-profile firings in the Trump administration, was an “anti-Muslim extremist.” Loomer has previously described Islam as a “cancer on humanity” and said Muslims should not be allowed to seek political office in the US.\n \n\n   \n    What are the legal issues?\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  In October,  Mario Guevara  – a Salvadoran journalist who documented immigration raids – was deported to El Salvador after spending months in federal custody. He was arrested in June while covering an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest against what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts and judges have voiced concern over the legal basis for such detentions. In September, William Young – a federal judge appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan – issued an extraordinary  161-page rebuke  of the Trump administration, saying its efforts to deport non-citizen activists represented a “full-throated assault on the First Amendment.”\n \n\n   \n  Young’s ruling is expected to be appealed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/democrats-afge-union-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"18:51:00Z","title":"Democrats not swayed by call to end shutdown from largest federal workers’ union","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrats remain unswayed by renewed calls from the largest federal workers' union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to reopen the government during a second-longest shutdown in U.S. history.

\nUpdated: \n        6:51 PM EDT, Mon October 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats appear to be unmoved by fresh demands from the largest federal employees’ union to reopen the government, a sign that the shutdown stalemate between lawmakers will continue as government workers increasingly feel the pain during the process.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest example of how pressure points have not had the power to bring an end to the current shutdown, which is already the second longest in US history with no end in sight. Over one million federal workers are going unpaid as the impasse drags on and some are turning to  food pantries .\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were quick to say they care about the plight of federal workers and what the union has to say. But that doesn’t change the fact that most remain firmly dug in on the position that they won’t provide the votes to reopen the government unless their concerns over the rising costs of health care are met.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin acknowledged that the statement from the American Federation of Government Employees, “immediately” has an “impact” on Democrats, who have closely aligned with the group, though he didn’t predict a change in strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “It has a lot of impact, and they’ve been our friends and we’ve worked with them over the years,” Durbin told reporters on Monday, adding that he has talked to representatives with the union and recognizes that they’re in “a terrible mess” representing so many federal employees who are missing paychecks and facing threats to their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Durbin told CNN, “I’m not seeing any change in position at this time” as Democrats continue to oppose a bill to extend current funding levels through November 21.\n \n\n   \n  The widespread belief among Democrats on Capitol Hill is that Republicans will be forced to cave first, particularly as they expect millions of Americans will find out their health care premiums are spiking when  open enrollment  begins on November 1. Republicans have refused to negotiate until the government reopens, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who represents a large population of federal workers, said of the union’s statement, “I work very closely with them. That matters to me. But the issue that I’ve always been focused on, that I’ve shared with y’all is, is a deal, a deal? And the AFGE would not want us to cut a deal and then have Trump fire a bunch of people next week. If we cut a deal and then he did that, they would come to us and say, ‘What the hell were you guys thinking?’”\n \n\n   \n  Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper said, “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t. I can’t remember a situation where I felt there were less palatable choices.”\n \n\n   \n  But he still doesn’t feel ready to vote to reopen the government like AFGE is asking. “I don’t feel comfortable with that, because I’m not convinced that, you know, sacrificing whatever it is, 30, 35 million people, who are going to either lose health care or pay dramatically more for it is worth that extra week, but it’s tough. Trust me, it’s a hard calculus to figure out.”\n \n\n   \n  Other Democrats argued the union statement did not represent a new stance.\n \n\n   \n  “I had a conversation with the president of AFGE earlier, right after the shutdown, and that was their position then. So that’s not a new position,” Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  on Monday, the president of AFGE Everett Kelley, who represents more than 800,000 workers spread across the the DC and federal government, said, “It’s time for our leaders to start focusing on how to solve problems for the American people, rather than on who is going to get the blame for a shutdown that Americans dislike.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s long past time for our leaders to put aside partisan politics and embrace responsible government,” Kelley added.\n \n\n   \n  Kelley called for lawmakers to pass a “clean” continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government. Republicans have put forward such a resolution that would reopen the government in the short term – until November 21 – but Democrats have repeatedly blocked it.\n \n\n   \n  AFGE had called on lawmakers to reopen the government on    October 1,  the first day of the shutdown, but Monday’s renewed push increased the spotlight on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he “certainly hopes” AFGE’s statement on Monday serves as a turning point in the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats claim President Donald Trump has access to funding that could help alleviate the challenges facing federal workers during this shutdown, but has instead  proposed billions  in a bailout to Argentina, used the shutdown as an opportunity to fire federal workers and cancel federal contracts that don’t align with his priorities, and went on a foreign trip to Asia instead of trying to break the deadlock.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Peter Welch said, “Trump can take care of this if he pauses to make a phone call and allow us to reach the health care resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, on the other hand, have blamed Democrats for the consequences of the shutdown, arguing that all they have to do is provide the votes to reopen the government for the impasse to end. They have pointed to missed paychecks for federal workers as the shutdown drags on as a reason the government needs to be reopened now, and argue that the negotiations on the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium subsidies can happen after that.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile,  another major union, the National Treasury Employees Union, told CNN it did not have an update on their position following AFGE’s new letter but has been calling for a bipartisan agreement to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/europe/lithuania-closes-border-belarus-drones-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"19:20:00-04:00","title":"Lithuania Closes Border with Belarus After Multiple Balloons Violate Airspace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lithuania has closed its border with Belarus in response to repeated balloon incursions into its airspace, which authorities believe are being used by Belarusian smugglers to transport cigarettes into the European Union.

Al-Hassan, who defected to Lebanon after the fall of the Assad regime, admitted in a CNN interview that he received an order to execute Tice after the journalist escaped from detention at a Republican Guard compound called Tahoune.

The U.S. FBI conducted a search in Syria in September 2025, though it was abruptly halted by an Israeli attack on Qatar. Despite the lack of definitive physical proof, the testimonies, including Al-Hassan’s admission and the failure of his polygraph test, suggest a strong case for Tice's death. The Tice family maintains he is alive, and the case remains a symbol of the regime’s systemic deception, repression, and disregard for human life.

\n       \n  By Clarissa Ward, Sarah El Sirgany, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “The Americans drove through here,” the Syrian army guard said, pointing to a steep road behind him. “I don’t know where they headed, I’m not allowed up there.”\n \n\n   \n  The barricaded road leads to a labyrinth of military facilities wedged into the rocky slopes of Mount Qasioun on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. It was as close as CNN could get to the locations searched by an FBI-led team that came here in September looking for traces of American journalist Austin Tice — more than a decade after he disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  The American team was hard to miss, arriving in a convoy of armored vehicles. Their objective was two-fold: to search for the place where Tice was last believed to have been held and, if possible, to find his remains.\n \n\n   \n  The US search focused on a facility called the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center. It lasted less than three days. On September 9, Israel launched its explosive attack on Qatar and the delegation abruptly left.\n \n\n   \n  The tip that led to the US search came from several witnesses, including Bassam Al-Hassan, a powerful adviser to former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the man who held Tice after his capture in mid-August 2012.\n \n\n   \n  For 13 years, the mystery of what happened to Austin Tice has plagued multiple US administrations. Then, after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, witnesses began to emerge. After fleeing to Iran, Al-Hassan made his way to Beirut, Lebanon in April, where he was interrogated by FBI investigators, along with several associates, about Tice’s capture.\n \n\n   \n  In September, CNN managed to track the apartment where Al-Hassan was living in Beirut. After knocking on his door, the team introduced themselves as CNN journalists. During a 20-minute conversation, the first time he’s been confronted by a journalist, Al-Hassan told CNN that Assad ordered the execution of Tice.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, Austin is dead. Austin is dead,” he said, his comments captured on video by hidden cameras worn by the team. He nodded yes when asked if Tice was killed in 2013, saying that he had passed the execution order down to a subordinate.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to protect Bashar al-Assad because he abandoned and left us,” Al-Hassan added. “I don’t want to protect Russia or Iran, because the US thinks Russia and Iran have something to do with the case. And I can assure you that this is not the case. This relates to President Bashar only,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Assad fled to Russia after the collapse of his regime and attempts by CNN to reach him were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hassan claims he passed the execution order onto a subordinate in the notorious Iran-backed, pro-government militia the National Defense Forces (NDF). CNN has learned the man in question is now in Russia. Through an intermediary, he refused to respond to CNN’s questions.\n \n\n   \n  Several sources that CNN spoke to claimed that there are holes in Al-Hassan’s story. CNN has confirmed that he failed a polygraph test given to him by the FBI.\n \n\n   \n  The truth is tangled in a web of lies that remain the enduring legacy of a regime that killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of its own people. In order to piece together what happened to Tice, CNN spoke to dozens of former and current officials, investigators and eyewitnesses in seven different countries. Many only spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters or protect their precarious status in the countries they fled to.\n \n\n   \n  While CNN cannot confirm that Tice is dead, for the first time we are hearing from people with direct knowledge of his capture, captivity and attempted escape. The accounts they provide strongly suggest that Tice was killed more than a decade ago, but there is no hard proof. Since the Assad regime fell last year, the new Syrian government has been keen to establish good relations with the US and has been working closely with American officials to help solve the Tice case. The FBI has ramped up its own investigation, collecting evidence on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “As well as a recovery operation this is also an active federal investigation and there is always the goal of trying to bring some justice to this situation,” said a person familiar with the FBI investigation.   \n \n\n   \n  Since Tice disappeared in 2012, his family has not wavered from the belief that he is still alive. His mother, Debra Tice, has waged a tireless public campaign on behalf of her son, lobbying the US government across multiple administrations to do whatever it can to return him alive. Earlier this year, not long after the Assad regime fell, Debra travelled to Damascus to look for him and sat down with Syria’s new President Ahmed Al-Sharaa. She has previously dismissed Al-Hassan as a “pathological liar.”\n \n\n   \n  “Austin Tice is alive. We look forward to seeing him walk free,” the Tice family told CNN in a statement.    \n \n\n   \n    Captivity\n \n\n   \n  Tice, an ex-US Marine Corps officer, reported from Syria during the summer of 2012, when protests against Assad had turned into an armed struggle. He embedded with rebels on the frontlines and documented the regime’s brutal crackdowns on peaceful protests. His daring approach got him bylines in top US outlets including the Washington Post and McClatchy.\n \n\n   \n  He filed his last report from Darayya, a Damascus suburb that still bears the marks of years   of fighting and bombardment. His family and editors said they lost contact with him in mid-August when he was supposed to travel to Lebanon for a break.\n \n\n   \n  For 13 years, the Syrian government consistently denied holding Tice or having any knowledge of his whereabouts, despite pressure from the American government and his family. Weeks after Assad fled Syria to Russia, cracks started to emerge in that story. Early this year, a former officer with Syria’s external intelligence branch, General Safwan Bahloul, gave testimony to Al Jazeera, saying that he’d interrogated Tice in 2012 at the behest of Al-Hassan.\n \n\n   \n  Bahloul agreed to talk to CNN only after securing permission from the new government in Damascus. A security official led the way to his house up a leafy hill in Latakia, the coastal province in Syria known for its loyalty to the Assads. Unlike other former officials who fled Syria, Bahloul took a settlement offered by the new government that essentially gives him amnesty.\n \n\n   \n  During a wide-ranging interview last month, Bahloul discussed how he first became aware of Tice.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to [Al-Hassan’s] office and he told me, ‘We have caught an American journalist. We want you to interrogate and see the possibility if he’s not a mere journalist or if he’s a spy,’” Bahloul said.\n \n\n   \n  Bahloul, who has spent time in the US and the UK and speaks English fluently, told CNN he interrogated Tice three times. “I just went through the names and the contacts on his phone, asking him about each name,” Bahloul said. “He was cooperative about it. He told me that he’s an ex-Marine officer. He wasn’t shaky. He was brave enough to face his custody. Sometimes even we talked about music.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice was held in a Republican Guard compound often referred to as Tahoune, under the command of Ghassan Nassour, a senior officer who reported to Al-Hassan. The line between the Republican Guard and the NDF was often blurred with officers serving in both, including Nassour.\n \n\n   \n  CNN managed to reach Nassour on the phone in his new home in the UAE.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not a formal prison, but a brief detention facility for offending soldiers,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When CNN visited the compound in September, it was mostly refurbished and used by soldiers of the new government. Faded Assad murals, discarded ammunition and bars on the windows of some rooms were the only traces left of the old guard.\n \n\n   \n  According to Nassour, the soldier who was assigned to bring food to Tice was instructed not to speak to him. Tice’s nationality and identity, Nassour claims, were known only to a handful of people close to Al-Hassan, whose office was across the road from Tahoune.\n \n\n   \n  “Ask any soldier in Tahoune and he would tell you they knew we had an important [prisoner], but no one knew who he was,” a low-ranking   soldier who worked in Al-Hassan’s office at the time, told CNN over the phone from his village in Latakia. He said he only figured out it was Tice when details of his captivity were reported in 2025. Before that, he did not dare ask.\n \n\n   \n    Signs of life\n \n\n   \n  Nassour recalled the day they took Tice to Rakhla, a mountainous area near the Lebanese border, to film a video that was released in September 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Under the direction of Al-Hassan, regime soldiers dressed up as jihadists and led a blindfolded Tice up a hill while chanting “God is Great,” Nassour said. The point, he added, was to give the impression that Tice was held by extremists and not the Assad regime.\n \n\n   \n  “The video was posted online the next day, and it was as if Tice was held by Taliban in Afghanistan and he never entered Syria,” Nassour said. Tice was seen in the 46-second video reciting the Muslim proclamation of faith and pleading, “Oh, Jesus.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials and independent analysts quickly determined the video was a ruse. US investigators followed the digital breadcrumbs to the Syrian regime. It was taken as evidence that Tice was in government hands and the first and only proof of life.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Tahoune, sometime in late October, Tice asked Bahloul for soap and a towel, which Bahloul said Tice used to escape. Syrian investigators at the time, Bahloul explained, determined that Tice used the soap to slip through the high window and the towel to jump over the shattered glass cemented at the top of the compound’s external wall.\n \n\n   \n  The low-ranking soldier in Al-Hassan’s team described the ensuing havoc. “We were on a state of alert. There was chaos because someone had escaped prison,” the soldier told CNN. “They distributed his picture to the checkpoints close to the compound.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice made it to the upscale Mazzeh neighborhood, about a mile from Tahoune. For more than 24 hours he was on the run in an area dotted with embassies and the homes of some of the regime’s top generals.\n \n\n   \n  “Every security apparatus in Damascus, thousands of operatives, they started the search, and he was caught by one of them, and he was redelivered to the National Defense Forces militia, which was headed at that time by Bassam Al-Hassan,” Bahloul said.\n \n\n   \n  Once Tice was recaptured, Bahloul was brought in one more time to see him.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt the connection between me and him was just lost. I was talking to him and he was not responding. He was, in a way we could say, depressed,” Bahloul recalled. “I never saw the guy again.”\n \n\n   \n  This time, Tice was taken to Al-Hassan’s office across the road from Tahoune. From there, the trail went silent, according to multiple Syrian intelligence and NDF commanders.\n \n\n   \n  “I stopped asking about the issue,” Nassour said. “In Syria if anyone hears that you’ve asked about what doesn’t concern you, you will be in trouble. I never asked again until the fall of the regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Bahloul told CNN of Tice, “It’s one of the most mysterious cases I have ever experienced.”\n \n\n   \n  The person who knows the key to the mystery is Al-Hassan.\n \n\n   \n    Bassam Al-Hassan\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hassan served as Assad’s adviser and created the notorious NDF militia, implicated in some of the worst crimes during Syria’s civil war. He was sanctioned by the UK and the EU in 2011 and by the US in 2014. The US sanctions note his multiple roles in the regime including “acting as the Syrian presidential representative to Syria’s Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), which is the government agency responsible for developing and producing non-conventional weapons and missiles.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, French prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Al-Hassan, Assad and others for complicity in war crimes over the use of chemical weapons against civilians in August 2013. The two attacks referenced in the case killed more than 1,000 people in the Damascus suburbs of Douma and Eastern Ghouta.\n \n\n   \n  “He was sort of like a right-hand man to Bashar al-Assad, someone Bashar could absolutely trust, someone who Bashar could farm out his dirtiest jobs, his most unpleasant of tasks to,” said Economist journalist Gareth Browne who has covered Al-Hassan extensively since the fall of the regime.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hassan has refused to talk to journalists and the only photographs of him online were incorrect or very old. In September, CNN obtained a recent photo of him, and a tip about where he was hiding out — an upscale apartment complex in a suburb of Beirut.\n \n\n   \n  A team from CNN spent an evening observing the buildings. One balcony and one man in particular appeared to match the photo. The next morning, CNN knocked on his door and asked him about Tice. He invited them in as soon as he heard Tice’s name.\n \n\n   \n  During the conversation, Al-Hassan appeared rattled that CNN had found him and repeatedly asked who told where he lived. He explained to CNN that he had recently told a team from the FBI that he had been holding Tice when Al-Assad gave him the order to execute him. According to multiple sources with knowledge of the interrogation, Al-Hassan also claimed that he tried to push back on Assad’s order but that the then-president was adamant.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple Syrians who know Al-Hassan disputed the likelihood of him challenging Assad.\n \n\n   \n  “You could say whatever you like about Bassam, but he is not the courageous guy… I couldn’t imagine him giving such, you know, ‘Sir, we shouldn’t.’ No, he doesn’t give such advice,” Bahloul said.\n \n\n   \n  Other sources told CNN that they question his motives for talking to the FBI. After the regime fell, the US government offered a reward of $10 million for information on Tice. Al-Hassan told CNN that he was not seeking a monetary award for coming forward.\n \n\n   \n  Sources also described Al-Hassan as cunning, Machiavellian, and not someone to be trusted. In many ways, Al-Hassan embodied the culture of the Assad era.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to look at the nature of this regime. You know, these people are competing with each other. It’s riddled with rivalries. There are   people lying and deceiving each other, even though they’re nominally on the same side,” said Browne, the Economist reporter.\n \n\n   \n    Behind the scenes\n \n\n   \n  Both Nassour and Bahloul told CNN that when Tice was first captured Assad was pleased and saw him as a valuable card to be used in later negotiations with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “Assad knew about Tice and knew he could use him in negotiations. It would be extremely stupid to kill him… to let go of a winning card in your hand,” Nassour said.\n \n\n   \n  Others CNN spoke to believed it was plausible that Assad would order Tice’s execution, particularly after his escape.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past 13 years, multiple US administrations made several offers to the Assad government in exchange for Tice’s release. Syrian negotiators were steadfast in their denial, even when US officials merely asked for a proof of life.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t logical for me. But I started to feel that there is something wrong happening around the case or around Austin,” General Abbas Ibrahim, Lebanon’s former spy chief, said of the failed negotiations during President Donald Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  A mediator who has negotiated the release of numerous Western hostages across the region, Ibrahim worked on Tice’s case through all US administrations starting with President Barack Obama’s until his retirement in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “The Americans were very interested in this case, and they were ready to pay any price to get [Tice] back,” Ibrahim said. “The regime in Syria had a big opportunity to save themselves [with] Austin, but they didn’t play this card because maybe they don’t have this card anymore,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Elusive justice\n \n\n   \n  During CNN’s visit to Tahoune and Bassam Al-Hassan’s office across the road, it was clear that traces of what happened there 13 years ago were gone — not just lost in the looting and vandalism by crowds retaliating against years of oppression in December, but painted over by the horrors these compounds witnessed over the years.\n \n\n   \n  In the months after the Assad dungeons were flung open last year, the hope to find Tice and tens of thousands of missing Syrians began fading. Those who hadn’t emerged were presumed dead. Many of their families refuse to officially accept this until the remains are found. They still hope that the truth, buried in secret graves and hidden in millions of old government documents, could provide closure one day.\n \n\n   \n  For the Tice family, the search for Austin goes on.\n \n\n   \n  It was only at the door on our way out that Al-Hassan’s voice cracked, saying he owed Tice’s mother an apology.\n \n\n   \n  “Truly, it upsets me to remember it. I wish what happened hadn’t happened,” Al-Hassan said. He removed his glasses revealing blood-shot eyes. “It was a predicament that I was burdened with.”\n \n\n   \n  Tice may simply be remembered as yet another victim of the endless lies and senseless cruelty of a ruthless regime.\n \n\n   \n   -Additional reporting by journalist Zaher Jaber in Syria \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/gavin-newsom-2028-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"18:47:00-04:00","title":"Gavin Newsom Expands on Potential 2028 Presidential Run","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly reconsidered his stance on a potential 2028 presidential campaign, citing a dramatic shift in national political conditions such as the National Guard's deployment in Los Angeles.

Gavin Newsom expanded on his comments about a  potential 2028 presidential campaign  during a wide-ranging interview Monday on CNN’s “The Story Is with Elex Michaelson.”\n \n\n   \n  “People talk about it and you’d be lying if you haven’t thought about it, processed it,” Newsom said. “But quite literally I’m making the case – that’s why I have this initiative, Prop 50 – there might not be a 2028 election that’s free and fair.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, said that he hasn’t thought about a presidential run “beyond just a few people bringing things up and talking about the future.” But Newsom, like a handful of other potential 2028 candidates, has been more forthcoming recently about his political prospects.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the California governor said he had “sub-zero” interest in running for president, even as he appeared to be taking steps to raise his national profile.

The governor said he plans to tackle the perception some Americans have of him in a book he’s releasing next year.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who spent most of his childhood raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, said the biggest misconception about him is “this notion of the silver spoon” and he “was born into great wealth and privilege.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s quite the contrary,” he said. “I’m going to be pushing back in that respect.”\n \n\n   \n    California is holding a consequential vote for the midterms\n \n\n   \n  At a time when Democrats are looking for new party leaders, Newsom has led the effort to  pass Proposition 50 , a ballot measure that would allow his party to make five GOP-held House seats in California more favorable for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom said that the  Department of Justice’s move to send election monitors to six California counties  ahead of the November 4 vote on Proposition 50 was an effort to chill free speech.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, it’s a pattern and practice,” he said. “They’re doing it as part of an intimidation strategy. They’re trying to suppress the vote.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also defended Proposition 50 from criticism leveled by former California Republican Gov.  Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has warned Democrats would be reluctant to give up control of any new seats. If the measure passes, the state would replace maps drawn by an independent commission with new maps drawn by California Democrats through the 2030 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is temporary, it’s transparent and it’s democratic,” Newsom said.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Newsom argued that the passage of Proposition 50 – along with electoral wins in the New Jersey and Virginia governors’ races – would boost the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  “The narrative is going to shift: Democrats are finally now no longer on their back heels, they’re on their toes,” Newsom said. “It’s about weakness versus strength, and the challenge the Democrats have had is we’ve appeared weak and meek. And now we are asserting ourselves.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor also weighed in on state politics. He said US Senator Alex Padilla, a California Democrat whom he appointed to the seat, would be “an outstanding governor,” if he chose to run in the 2026 race.\n \n\n   \n  That primary was shaken up in recent weeks after former Rep. Katie Porter, seen as a frontrunner,  faced backlash over videos of her berating staff  and angrily avoiding follow-up questions in a news interview. Newsom said he reached out to her and said she deserved some grace.\n \n\n   \n  “We all have a bad day,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/business/amazon-corporate-layoffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"18:40:00Z","title":"Amazon Could Cut as Many as 30,000 Corporate Jobs, Reports Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amazon is reportedly planning to lay off up to 30,000 corporate employees—nearly 10% of its workforce—driven by advances in artificial intelligence and economic uncertainty.

on US military strikes on alleged drug boats, even as lawmakers have said they have not received the information they want.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration provided Congress seven separate classified briefings since early September, covering members or staff from House leadership, Senate leadership, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees,” a senior administration official said in a statement to CNN when asked whether the White House would be briefing Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The White House confirmed to CNN that those briefings were specifically about the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Senate and House leadership and the committees named.\n \n\n   \n  One Democratic Senate aide told CNN that the administration “appears to be counting the same briefing given multiple times to certain staff or members (including in small groups.) So seven briefings is highly misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  A GOP House Armed Services Committee aide said, “I can’t speak to what they’ve done on the Senate side, but I can confirm that they’ve been very responsive, and our committee has gotten 3 separate classified briefings at this point – 2 for staff and 1 for members.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who was briefed on recent US military strikes, said on Sunday that the evidence he was presented doesn’t “back up” all of the administration’s claims about the boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona Democrat told ABC’s “This Week” that White House and Pentagon officials who briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee couldn’t give a “logical explanation” about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They were tying themselves in knots trying to explain this. We had a lot of questions for them, both Democrats and Republicans. It was not a good meeting. It did not go well,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  And the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins last week that he hasn’t gotten the information he’s looking for from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve tried to ask questions. The Pentagon, Intel services have provided no answers to Congress to date,” the Washington state Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on whether his committee has gotten any answers, Smith pointed to conversations he has had with GOP Chairman Mike Rogers.\n \n\n   \n  “This is somewhat bipartisan. I’ve spoken to Chairman Mike Rogers, good friend, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I work closely with. He hasn’t gotten the answers either,” Smith said, adding that he’d like to have a hearing.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, we want to have a hearing, and we’re supposed to set one up,” he said, arguing that’s been “complicated” by Speaker Mike Johnson keeping the House out of session amid the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President Donald Trump, on Sunday defended the president’s ability to potentially authorize more extensive military operations as he ramps up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a real possibility,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” when asked about land strikes Trump has recently teased, adding that the president told him that Congress will be briefed on “future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia” when he returns from Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land.

Kennedy Jr. has touted the revamp as an opportunity to transform people’s eating habits and bring federal food policy in line with the core tenets of his  Make America Healthy Again movement . The guidelines, which are updated every five years, also carry far-reaching implications for school meals and an array of federal nutrition programs.\n \n\n   \n  A fierce critic of the current dietary recommendations, Kennedy has blamed poor diet for driving many of the nation’s biggest health challenges. He’s promised vastly simplified guidelines that put fresh emphasis on whole foods — including consuming more saturated fats from meat and dairy products.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a tremendous amount of emerging science that talks about the need for protein in our diet and more fats in our diet,” Kennedy said during a July event with ice cream brands.\n \n\n   \n  In response to inquiries from CNN, spokespeople for the White House and HHS confirmed the delay in finalizing the guidelines, with a White House official calling it “another unfortunate consequence” of a shutdown that the administration has blamed on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy originally aimed to deliver the new dietary guidelines by the end of September, months earlier than the official year-end deadline. After health and agriculture officials missed that target, they set a new goal of unveiling them by the end of October.\n \n\n   \n  But now, with the shutdown slowing the final stage of work and no end to the impasse in sight, the administration is tentatively planning to roll out the guidelines at some point in December. The government is required to finalize the guidelines by December 31 at the latest.\n \n\n   \n  HHS and the USDA have spent much of the year working on the new guidelines. Although many Americans may not read the guide, which currently runs 164 pages, its recommendations shape what foods schools serve to students, what doctors recommend to patients and what can be purchased on food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  That means Kennedy’s vow to drastically reshape the guidelines could put billions of dollars in yearly spending at stake, spurring intense speculation and lobbying across the food industry, where every change can have significant financial consequences.\n \n\n   \n  The promotion of more saturated fats would represent a particularly sharp departure from the current recommendations, which have advised seeking out fat-free or low-fat dairy foods and limiting saturated fats to 10% of a person’s daily diet.\n \n\n   \n  The potential changes have alarmed some nutrition experts, who argue that there are significant and well-established links between consuming red meat and risks to heart health. The recommendation to limit saturated fat is one of the longest-standing recommendations in the federal dietary guidelines, according to nonprofit nutritional health advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n \n\n   \n  But Kennedy and MAHA advocates have dismissed those concerns, rejecting the current scientific consensus as flawed and unduly influenced by corporate interests.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting the food guidance and cleaning house on the food pyramid, a document that was contaminated by industry influence, not based on good science but what they wanted you to buy,” US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in  a July interview with CNN .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/graham-platner-democrats-dilemma","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"18:16:00Z","title":"Democrats’ Dilemma on Maine Senate Candidate Graham Platner","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the political dilemma Democrats face in supporting Graham Platner, a Maine Senate candidate with controversial online statements and a tattoo linked to Nazi imagery.

Democrats’ dilemma on Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:16 PM EDT, Mon October 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If anyone thought recent revelations about Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner’s past would give Democrats instant clarity about their party’s path forward, they apparently have another thing coming.\n \n\n   \n  Since the revelations about  extreme statements Platner made online  and  his tattoo featuring Nazi imagery , indicators have pointed to a drawn-out and arduous primary process for the 2026 race.\n \n\n   \n  First, a poll showed Platner with a huge early lead on Maine Gov. Janet Mills in the primary,  58%-24% , as of mid-October. The University of New Hampshire poll was conducted almost wholly before the tattoo story broke, but the numbers were remarkable. They suggested Platner had a real base to work with — one that could make him a force even if it’s diminished.\n \n\n   \n  And second, we’ve seen a number of prominent figures dig in on their Platner support — or at least not ditch him. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont unapologetically stood by him. And Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday he viewed Platner as “a human being who made mistakes, recognizes them, and is very open about it.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s clear some Democrats view this as the time to have a long-overdue debate over the future of the party — one in which they don’t so easily dismiss candidates who excite voters but might have baggage.\n \n\n   \n  And who could forgive them? After all, they’ve witnessed a Republican president in Donald Trump who practically flaunts his baggage daily. Why can’t Democrats try to emulate that? Why should  they  have to give up on someone, just because — in their minds — of some Reddit posts and a tattoo whose Nazi links Platner insists he didn’t understand? (Reporting  by CNN’s KFile  last week undercut Platner’s claims he only recently learned the tattoo had Nazi origins.)\n \n\n   \n  These are all valid debates for Democrats to have.\n \n\n   \n  But they also gloss over plenty of realities.\n \n\n   \n    Candidates with baggage have done poorly — when they’re not named Trump\n \n\n   \n  The first is that, while Trump has succeeded despite plenty of baggage, few candidates have been able to emulate his approach. Indeed, the fates of such candidates largely suggest political gravity very much still applies to those not named Trump.\n \n\n   \n  You only need to look at the last two elections — 2022 and 2024. In 2022, a host of Trump-aligned and more-extreme candidates  badly underperformed  other, more mainstream Republicans. Think Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters and Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker. It’s quite possible that these kinds of candidates  cost Republicans the Senate  by losing very winnable races.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere was this more evident than in secretary of state races, where nearly all of the  prominent election-deniers running lost . Whatever traction Trump has gotten with his false claims of stolen elections, it didn’t seem to translate to other candidates.\n \n\n   \n  The 2024 election was similar, if less pronounced because Republicans did a better job of weeding such candidates out. But even there, we saw a number of such candidates  badly underperforming the top of the ticket , especially on the GOP side — such as Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake and North Carolina gubernatorial candidate  Mark Robinson .\n \n\n   \n  Some Democrats might believe Platner is different from these candidates — either in his baggage or in his ability to connect with voters. But just imagine the ads where Republicans would be able to use Platner’s own words to be able to paint him as a  communist  or even an  antifa supporter .\n \n\n   \n    Democrats have little margin for error\n \n\n   \n  The second factor to emphasize is that the stakes in getting this right are simply much higher for Democrats than they are for Republicans in similar circumstances.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a significantly smaller margin for error when it comes to winning a Senate majority. Republicans could afford some bad candidates who cost them in key states; Democrats need to run the table in states where they have a shot, like Maine, to win a Senate majority in 2026. And the results there will also say plenty about their hopes to hold the Senate in the years to come.\n \n\n   \n  This is because the Senate map has come to clearly favor Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  Recent elections suggest there are about 25 bona-fide red states, compared with about 19 bona-fide blue states. Trump has won at least half the states in all three of his campaigns, and as many as 30 and 31 states in his two victories. Joe Biden won only 25 states even as he won in a pretty decisive 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  That means Republicans are clear favorites in states comprising half of all Senate seats, while Democrats start as favorites for about 38 seats.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re facing math like that, it means you have to get things right in a blue-leaning state like Maine. You can’t afford to have a bunch of candidates like Masters, Walker and Lake.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats are to win the Senate in 2026, they probably need to win not just in Maine, but also win every swing state and flip a seat in a red state like Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  And longtime Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has proved very difficult to beat. Democratic opponent Sara Gideon in 2020 raised tens of millions of dollars and led in most polls — only to lose by 9 points on Election Day. Collins won that race even though Trump lost the state by 9 points.\n \n\n   \n    They’re placing a heavy bet, despite lots to caution them\n \n\n   \n  It would be one thing to place such a heavy bet on a proven campaigner with a history of winning and weathering storms — or to do so in a state where you only had an outside shot of victory in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  But a lot of liberals and Democrats are investing a lot of hope and political capital in Platner. And they’re doing it despite plenty of things pointing them in the opposite direction.\n \n\n   \n  A case in point is the KFile report from CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski that called into question Platner’s defense that he only recently learned that a tattoo on his chest had Nazi origins.\n \n\n   \n  Platner’s campaign also appears to be going through some  real internal struggles , including the  departures of high-profile figures .\n \n\n   \n  And at least some are cautioning that this isn’t the candidate to place such a bet on.\n \n\n   \n  “I want Democrats to be on guard that we don’t offer a Diet Coke populism to MAGA’s Coca-Cola, including thinking that bigotry is populist,” Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts  told Politico . “It’s not. There are scores of dynamic, gritty candidates who don’t have antisemitic tattoos.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/business/argentina-stock-market-milei-party-win","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"A Key Trump Ally Won an Election.

The Argentine peso surged as much as 10% against the US dollar before paring gains.\n \n\n   \n  Milei’s party, La Libertad Avanza, secured better-than-expected victories in midterm legislative elections on Sunday. The win gives Milei a fresh opportunity to try to enact economic reforms and stave off concerns of a financial crisis, analysts said, boosting investor confidence.\n \n\n   \n  “After weeks of political turbulence and pronounced market volatility, President Javier Milei has emerged with a commanding mandate from the Argentine electorate,” economists at JPMorgan Chase said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  The win halted a recent slide in the Argentine peso after weeks of financial market turbulence. The US government earlier this month announced a  $20 billion currency swap  to support the peso as well as outright purchases of pesos.\n \n\n   \n  “President Milei has a renewed mandate for change,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in a statement on social media. “We look forward to continued steps toward economic freedom that will attract private sector investment and job creators, bringing prosperity to the Argentine people.”\n \n\n   \n  The midterm victory presents a chance for Milei to push forward with reforms that have drawn the ire of critics but support from allies including the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “The breadth of his victory, coupled with expanded representation in Congress, places his administration in a prime position to capitalize on the political and financial backing extended by Washington,” JPMorgan Chase economists said in a note.\n \n\n   \n    Markets cheer Milei’s victory\n \n\n   \n  Since assuming office in late 2023, Milei has wielded a chainsaw approach to government reform in Argentina. He has  slashed government spending  and tried to implement free market policies in part to rein in runaway inflation. A win by the opposition political coalition, the Peronists, could have derailed those reforms.\n \n\n   \n  But Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party secured roughly 41% of the vote on Sunday, beating out the Peronist coalition by a substantial margin.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Milei’s party secured more than one third of the seats in the lower house of Congress. That means the opposition could no longer have the necessary two-thirds of legislators’ votes to override presidential vetoes. However, he will still need support from centrist and center-right lawmakers to pass legislation, Alejo Czerwonko, CIO for emerging markets Americas at UBS, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Investors cheered Milei’s victory. The Global X MSCI Argentina exchange-traded fund, which tracks the Argentine stock market, soared 19% and posted its best day on record.\n \n\n   \n  Argentina’s markets were beginning to fracture in recent weeks, with the peso tumbling and bond yields rising as investors became increasingly skeptical of Milei’s ability to enact reforms. The  US government’s intervention  to buy Argentine pesos extended a lifeline to Milei.\n \n\n   \n  The “strong and conclusive performance” by Milei’s party in the midterm elections led to a “sharp repricing” of Argentine assets as risks diminished and the outlook for the economy improved, according to Alberto Ramos, head of LatAm economics at Goldman Sachs.\n \n\n   \n  “This should give Milei’s administration a fresh endowment of legitimacy and political capital, which if well used to build broader political alliances, should strengthen governability and the outlook for key reforms,” Ramos said. “That also bodes well for the continuation of US financial support.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump had said in recent weeks that US support for Milei was  contingent  on his political success. Milei himself will be up for reelection in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  “Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,” Trump said in a  post  on social media early Monday.\n \n\n   \n  But economists warned Argentina’s assets — and the US government’s bet on Milei’s success — still face hurdles.\n \n\n   \n  “The rally is not a sign that Argentina’s problems are over,” said Mauricio Monge, senior economist at Oxford Economics. “The Argentine peso is still overvalued, there are structural issues with growth and employment, and securing fiscal measures to ensure sound fiscal policy in the country remains crucial. But now Milei has the chance to carry out these measures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/entertainment/sean-combs-release-date-2028","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"17:21:00-04:00","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ prison release date set for 2028","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a prominent music executive, has been sentenced to 50 months in federal prison for transporting women to engage in prostitution, following a two-month trial in which he was convicted on two counts but acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges.

\nUpdated: \n        5:21 PM EDT, Mon October 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sean “Diddy” Combs’ release date from prison has been set, more than three months after a jury delivered a mixed verdict in his federal trial.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is expected to be released on May 8, 2028, according to public records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n \n\n   \n  Combs had been sentenced to 50 months (roughly more than four years) by a judge after a two-month trial ended with him being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs was acquitted by a jury of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering for which he was facing decades and possibly life in prison if convicted.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ release date reflects his time already served. He has already served roughly one year in jail. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest.\n \n\n   \n  His defense did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding which prison at which he will be serving the rest of his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is appealing his conviction and sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ defense previously told CNN that they had approached President Donald Trump’s administration about a potential pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ attorney Nicole Westmoreland  told CNN  in August that it was her “understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon.” At the time, a White House official told CNN they “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any clemency request.”\n \n\n   \n  In October after his sentencing, Trump confirmed that Combs had requested a presidential pardon in connection with his federal criminal case,  telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins  “a lot of people have asked me for pardons,” including Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously indicated that he was unlikely to pardon Combs during an  interview  with Newsmax, saying, “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.” Trump said that this made pardoning Combs “more difficult to do.”\n \n\n   \n  During his trial, Combs’ defense admitted to his pattern of violent behavior against women with whom he was in romantic relationships over the years. The jury was repeatedly shown footage — first published in 2024 by CNN — of Combs violently beating his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016. The jury was also shown images of bloody gashes and bruises on Ventura’s body during trial.\n \n\n   \n  Ventura was the star witness of the case and testified that she was repeatedly abused by Combs and forced to take drugs and have sex with other men against her will throughout their 10-year relationship, during which he controlled her career and finances. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” also recounted psychological, financial and physical abuse by Combs who she said forced her to have sex with other men while she was under the influence of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  At his sentencing, judge Arun Submaranian  admonished Combs  for his abuse and rejected the defense’s “attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate consensual experiences or just a sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll story.” Submaranian said that the prosecution’s case “showed that (Combs) abused the power and control (he) had over the women (he) professed to love dearly.”\n \n\n   \n  “You abused them physically, emotionally and psychologically and you used that abuse to get your way,” he said, addressing Combs. “This was subjugation, and it drove both Ms. Ventura and Jane to thoughts of ending their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs is also facing roughly 70 civil lawsuits where most of the dozens of accusers — some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged incidents — claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs has denied all of the civil claims. Some of the lawsuits have been dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/media/jon-stewart-daily-show-paramount-trump-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00-04:00","title":"Jon Stewart says he wants to stay at ‘The Daily Show,’ urges people to ‘fight like hell’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jon Stewart has expressed his intention to remain on 'The Daily Show' after his contract ends in December 2025, emphasizing that he will not compromise his commitment to satire, truth, and journalistic integrity under political pressure.

employees to immediately search their workstations and digital media for any records pertaining to the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, two law enforcement sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The directive, which comes nearly a month into the federal government shutdown, is the latest in a series of highly unusual demands in recent months directing FBI employees to conduct priority searches for any files they may have on decades-old mysteries.\n \n\n   \n  Hoffa’s  presumed death  has vexed investigators for decades. He was 62 years old when he was  last seen outside a restaurant in Michigan on July 30, 1975. \n \n\n   \n  The FBI has searched various locations over the years in their effort to locate Hoffa’s remains but have always come up empty-handed.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections – and were notoriously tied to organized crime – Hoffa was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud.\n \n\n   \n  President  Richard Nixon pardoned Hoffa in 1971  on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980. But Hoffa tried to regain control of the union, angering his rivals.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the FBI about the Hoffa documents search.\n \n\n   \n  The request comes as FBI employees have been pulled away from other assignments since the start of the Trump administration to work on other priority topics like immigration enforcement, countering violent crime, and  redacting files  associated with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  CNN reported that FBI employees  had received a similar order to conduct priority searches for material relating to the disappearance of Amelia Earhart.\n \n\n   \n  “Per a priority request from the Executive Office of the President of the United States, please search any areas where papers or physical media records may be stored, to include both open or closed cases, for records responsive to Amelia Earhart,” the earlier message to employees stated.\n \n\n   \n  Earhart was attempting to become the first woman to fly around the world when her plane went missing over the Pacific Ocean in 1937. She was declared lost at sea following a 16-day search.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump last month said he was directing his administration to “declassify and release all government records” related to Earhart.\n \n\n   \n  Earhart, the first female pilot to fly solo over the Atlantic Ocean, broke a number of aviation records, and she has been a source of public fascination during her life and after.\n \n\n   \n  Conspiracy theories have developed since the aviator’s disappearance, but as CNN noted in 2024, the US government suspected that Earhart and her navigator crashed into the Pacific when the plane ran out of fuel.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously ordered the release of documents related to other high-profile deaths that have sparked conspiracy theories, including records related to the assassinations of President John F.

Just weeks earlier, Trump had  threatened  to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese exports and said he might call off a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Now, that meeting looks set to take place this week.\n \n\n   \n  If all that seems like a rerun of a movie we’ve seen before but no one quite remembers how it ends, that’s because it never really did.\n \n\n   \n    The rare-earth chokehold\n \n\n   \n  The latest escalation between Trump and Xi arose after  Beijing announced  plans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s hardly anything new — China, which controls the majority of the world’s supply of rare earth minerals, began putting measures in place to limit foreign access to them over 30 years ago. And as demand for China’s rare earths has increased since, so have the safeguards for allowing other countries to purchase them.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting with Chinese trade negotiators in Malaysia over the weekend, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he anticipates the high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi could result in “some kind of deferral” on rare-earth export controls.\n \n\n   \n  US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has led Chinese trade talks with Bessent, said the Treasury secretary told Chinese negotiators at their last meeting, “This is the last time we want to be talking about rare earths.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, that is not the last time  they  want to be talking about it,” Greer told reporters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  He’s right. “Some kind of deferral” simply means Xi is still going to be able to use access to rare earths as leverage over the United States any time he is perturbed with actions Trump takes.\n \n\n   \n  And when Beijing inevitably announces new ramped-up export controls of rare earths, Trump will likely respond by threatening higher tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s no guarantee Trump or Xi will build off their envoys’ groundwork. Trump has a recent history of stirring the pot, undermining the diplomatic victories Bessent and Greer secured with China. For instance, just weeks after they inked a deal resulting in significantly lower tariffs on both countries, Trump slapped  export controls  on chip design software to China. (Those were  later lifted .)\n \n\n   \n  The more optimistic take, though, is there could be some breakthrough deal on rare earths or otherwise that comes out of a meeting between Trump and Xi this week. But it’s still hard to take any progress between Trump and Xi too seriously, considering both sides have alleged the other violated prior deals.\n \n\n   \n  Just last week, Greer opened an investigation into whether China is adhering to the terms of a trade agreement Trump brokered during his first term. As part of that agreement, China committed to increasing purchases of American products by $200 billion by the end of 2021. However, it fell far short of that level.\n \n\n   \n    A growing fire\n \n\n   \n  As Trump sought to lower the temperature with China, a longtime rival, he raised it with one of America’s biggest allies and neighbors, Canada.\n \n\n   \n  In response to an ad Ontario commissioned that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Trump  threatened  to increase tariffs on Canada, America’s second-largest trading partner, by an additional 10%.\n \n\n   \n  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been hesitant to retaliate against tariffs Trump has enacted on his country, but that doesn’t mean he won’t. After Trump suspended trade talks over the tariff ad, Carney told reporters Monday: “It doesn’t pay to be upset. Emotions don’t carry you very far.”\n \n\n   \n  Either way, if Trump continues to alienate his allies, he risks making America’s economy even more dependent on China.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/government-shutdown-snap-food-stamps","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"16:46:00Z","title":"Democrats Unflinching in Shutdown Strategy, Blaming Trump with Millions at Risk of Losing Food Aid","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the fourth week of a government shutdown, Congressional Democrats are refusing to support reopening the government unless their demands for healthcare reform are met, maintaining a united front despite mounting public anxiety.

And they’re increasingly hammering  President Donald Trump  for his failure to sit down to negotiate with Democrats, while instead embarking on his second foreign trip so far during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This is all Trump,” a visibly frustrated Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump’s not engaged. Republicans won’t negotiate,” the Democrat said, arguing that Trump’s trip to Asia this week as “an indication of how he could care less.”\n \n\n   \n  A fired-up Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was even more blunt, calling it “outrageous” that Trump would take another foreign trip with the government shut down.\n \n\n   \n  “The message is, frankly, President Trump: ‘Stay in America. Put America first. Sit down with us and work this out,’” Warner said.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are maintaining fierce unity publicly and privately, with lawmakers and senior aides telling CNN that they are prepared to stick with the party’s strategy for the near future. The widespread belief among Democrats on Capitol Hill is that Republicans will be forced to cave first, particularly as they expect millions of Americans will find out their health care premiums are spiking when  open enrollment  begins on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another major deadline coming at the start of November. Washington is about to face what could be the most significant effect of the shutdown to date, with roughly  42 million people at risk  of losing critical food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “We understand this is not easy, and this is going to be painful,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 House Democrat, said when asked about the SNAP deadline, which is causing deep anxiety across Washington. “Everybody is feeling this, and I think that our message to the American public is, we’re fighting to protect your health care.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, including Aguilar, insist Trump can save the program if he wants to. And they’re ripping the White House for its  $20 billion bailout to Argentina  while the massive food aid program remains at risk.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture said Sunday it will not use its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food stamp benefits next month as the government shutdown continues.\n \n\n   \n  “Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,”  a statement on the USDA’s website states .\n \n\n   \n  When asked Friday whether he would direct the USDA to fund food stamps next month, Trump told reporters: “Yeah, everybody is going to be in good shape, yep.” The president did not provide additional details, but his comments appeared to conflict with the agency’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the head of a union representing more than 800,000 federal employees said in a Monday statement it was “past time” for the stalemate to end, for furloughed workers to be immediately put back to work and for those who missed their paychecks to receive back pay.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s long past time for our leaders to put aside partisan politics and embrace responsible government,”  wrote  Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees.\n \n\n   \n  Kelley called for lawmakers to pass a “clean” continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government. Republicans have put forward such a resolution that would reopen the government in the short term – until November 21 – but Democrats have repeatedly blocked it.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, GOP lawmakers and senior aides believe the White House is eager to find some way to keep those SNAP payments flowing to the poorest Americans. Members of both parties — including GOP and Democratic governors — have been furiously pushing the White House to find a way to avoid that outcome, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, meanwhile, are criticizing the White House for what they argue is an attempt to “weaponize” hunger, insisting that the administration has the unilateral authority to act.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a single American should go hungry. And the challenge that we confront right now is that Donald Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill are trying to weaponize hunger in order to jam their extreme right wing policies in their spending bill down the throats of the American people,” Jeffries told reporters on Friday, arguing that the Trump administration has roughly $5 billion in an emergency contingency fund that could be used for the SNAP program.\n \n\n   \n  As part of their pressure campaign, dozens of Democrats signed a letter to Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Friday, arguing that the administration has the existing funds and authority to fully fund SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Rollins, however,  has said  that there will not be enough funds for the food aid benefits for millions by November 1 if Congress doesn’t act.\n \n\n   \n  One GOP lawmaker — Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley — is so concerned about SNAP that he has introduced legislation to fund the program for the duration of the shutdown. Leavitt said Thursday the administration would  support the bill , but it’s not clear whether it will come up.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Thursday whether Trump should work to alleviate some of the pressure points in the shutdown, like SNAP benefits, another GOP senator suggested there may be some procedural hurdles to doing so.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s simpler said than done,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall responded, adding, “On the one hand, there needs to be some pressure to put on the Democrats to come to the table and do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Marshall, who is also an obstetrician-gynecologist, said he had a “lot of concern” about the SNAP and WIC program. He observed, “It is very important to my practice. Lots of pregnant women, breastfeeding women use that program as well. I think it’s a good pressure point for them.”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri said the solution for the shutdown’s various pressure points was “for the Democrats to vote to fund the government.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/sean-duffy-nasa-transportation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"15:28:00-04:00","title":"Sean Duffy irks White House as drama over top job at NASA seeps into public view","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a growing internal conflict within the Trump administration over who should lead NASA, centering on Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is serving as acting administrator.

October 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Some Trump administration officials, including at the White House, have expressed frustration with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in recent weeks as internal wrangling over who will lead NASA spilled into public view, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy, who also  serves as NASA’s acting administrator,  has said privately that he would like to not only hold the space chief title permanently, but also fold NASA into the Department of Transportation, one source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the secretary told CNN he said that “NASA might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but denied Duffy said he wanted to keep the NASA administrator job.\n \n\n   \n  There is now competition as  Jared Isaacman  – the Elon Musk associate whose nomination for the position was pulled by President Donald Trump earlier this year – has reemerged as a candidate for the top job at NASA.\n \n\n   \n  The  abrupt withdrawal of Isaacman  left a bad taste in the mouths of many within the White House, who pointed fingers at a top Trump aide for convincing the president that Isaacman’s past Democratic donations disqualified him.\n \n\n   \n  That frustration only grew when the decision appeared to ignite a messy monthslong feud between Trump and billionaire Musk.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman and Trump, however, reopened lines of communication over the summer, and it soon became clear to officials, including Duffy, that Isaacman was back in the mix to lead NASA.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy, who has ruffled feathers within the White House for going directly to Trump, rather than through proper White House channels, suggested to the president that he be part of the hiring process for the NASA administrator role, a White House official said. A NASA spokesperson denied that account to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy and several of his DOT advisers interviewed Isaacman on October 13 for the job. Duffy has conducted other interviews as well; however, in the eyes of White House officials, Isaacman has remained the front-runner.\n \n\n   \n  “(Trump) likes (Duffy). He’s not going anywhere,” a White House official said, while noting the public spectacle over the NASA job has been a headache for some administration officials. Another source said that the president was praising Duffy privately to advisers while traveling in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Duffy said the secretary has focused NASA “on one clear goal — making sure America gets back to the Moon before China.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President asked him to talk with potential candidates for Administrator, and he’s been happy to help by vetting people and giving his honest feedback,” the spokesperson added in a statement. “The bottom line is that Secretary Duffy is here to serve the President, and he will support whomever the President nominates.”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has courted the president as well, making high-dollar donations and attending fundraisers at the White House as recently as this month, one source said. The Wall Street Journal first  reported  on the jockeying for the top NASA post.\n \n\n   \n  The internal battle came into the spotlight last week,  as Musk got involved, publicly sparring with Duffy  about the future of NASA.\n \n\n   \n  “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?” Musk wrote on X. “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” he said in another post.\n \n\n   \n  It came after Duffy told CNBC last week  that he believes SpaceX,  which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was made aware of the attacks on Duffy during his trip to Asia — only commenting that he didn’t like Musk going after the transportation secretary.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials said that while the president would eventually name a head of NASA, it wasn’t something that he was fixated on, making it unclear when it would happen.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Duffy is a valuable member of President Trump’s team and he is doing a tremendous job leading the department of transportation, especially during this difficult time when Democrats have shut down the government and forced air traffic controllers to work without pay,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/uk/king-charles-heckled-prince-andrew-epstein-video-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"15:15:00Z","title":"Britain’s King Charles heckled over brother Prince Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a public visit to Lichfield Cathedral, King Charles was heckled by a protester who questioned his knowledge of Prince Andrew’s alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein, following renewed public attention sparked by Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.

accuses Russia of war crimes in drone warfare and forcible transfer of civilians \n       \n  By Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:13 PM EDT, Mon October 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A new report from the United Nations accuses Russia of committing crimes against humanity by attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure with drones, as well as committing war crimes through the forcible transfer of people.\n \n\n   \n  Drone attacks on civilians in areas along the front line of  Russia’s war with Ukraine  amount to the crime against humanity of murder, the report says. Russia also committed war crimes by intentionally attacking civilians and civilian targets, according to the report by the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200 civilians have been killed in the southern Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv since July 2024, the report says, citing local authorities. Over 2,000 civilians were injured in these areas in the same time frame, it says.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the war, Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of targeting civilians. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on the latest UN report.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Rendering civilian life unbearable’\n \n\n   \n  The drone attacks investigated by the commission regularly targeted civilian homes and infrastructure such as hospitals, humanitarian distribution points, power facilities and a school, according to the UN report. These strikes were “intentional and part of a coordinated policy to drive civilians out of those territories,” the commission found.\n \n\n   \n  The attacks have “spread terror among the population and have rendered civilian life unbearable,” it concluded. People have fled the areas where attacks were most prevalent, the report says, leaving some places “almost entirely vacated.”\n \n\n   \n  In some cases, only people with limited mobility, the elderly, caregivers and those with no means to leave have stayed behind, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  The commission did not accuse any individuals of responsibility for the crimes it documented but blamed them generally on the “Russian armed forces” or “Russian authorities.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported on countless drone strikes on civilians in Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past month, the northern Ukrainian regions of  Chernihiv and Sumy  have frequently come under attack, leaving many people without power as temperatures get colder.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a  wave of airstrikes  damaged a key bridge between Kherson’s island, Korabel, and the main city, sparking a widespread effort to evacuate the estimated 1,800 Ukrainian civilians who still lived there.\n \n\n   \n  Natalya, a resident of Antonivka in Kherson who asked to be identified only by her first name for safety reasons,  told CNN last October  that it was impossible to leave her house because of the drone attacks in her suburb. “It’s like a safari on us,” she said of the drone strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Those interviewed in the UN report described being surveilled, followed and even chased by drones while going about their everyday lives.\n \n\n   \n  “Victims and witnesses stated that at the time when drones hit their houses, they were engaged in ordinary activities such as spending time in their yards, gardening, caring for their animals, disposing of trash, or parking their vehicles,” the report says.\n \n\n   \n    Forcible transfer of civilians\n \n\n   \n  Russia has also committed war crimes by unlawfully deporting civilians from areas of Ukraine it has occupied, including Zaporizhzhia oblast in the southeast of the country, the commission of inquiry found.\n \n\n   \n  Often, these deportations were carried out with very short or no notice, giving people no opportunity to pack or speak to their families before being forcibly transported, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022 and 2023, a number of civilian adults were forcibly transferred out of Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia to territories under Ukrainian control, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Accused of “failing to cooperate, carrying out activities considered as destabilizing, or having a pro-Ukrainian position,” they were made to walk between 10 and 15 kilometers (roughly 6.2 miles to 9.3 miles) out of Russian-held territory through an “operational area with landmines and trenches” in it, “while hearing shots and shelling nearby,” the report says. Some civilians went missing following the deportations, it says.\n \n\n   \n  Before people were forcibly transferred or deported, “arrests, detentions, various forms of violence – sometimes including torture – searches (and) confiscations of documents and property” took place, the commission found.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow has long been accused of forcibly transferring Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.

Behind closed doors: How neighbors were oblivious to secret poker games and the Mafia who investigators say helped run them \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 PM EDT, Mon October 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Behind the glass doors of an unassuming building in Manhattan, staring across a shuttered print shop, a shadowy world stirred, coming alive with the flick of cards, the muted clink of glasses and the quiet hum of a dangerous secret.\n \n\n   \n  Inside one of the three units of the lavish Kip’s Bay apartment, linked to the Bonanno family, one of New York’s notorious five Italian American Mafia clans, an illegal poker operation unfolded, according to the US Attorney’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The elaborate scheme, masterminded by members of four Mafia families in collusion with celebrity athletes, ensnared unsuspecting victims, bleeding them of  over $7 million  through cunning deception, prosecutors said in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, 31 people, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and former NBA player Damon Jones of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat,  were arrested  for allegedly participating in a nationwide conspiracy to rig illegal poker games.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Billups denied the allegations. CNN has reached out to Jones’ representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said 13 members and associates of the four Mafia families supported the games and collected a share of their profits, according to the indictment. Members of the illicit poker scheme at times threatened and resorted to violence when victims failed to pay their debts on time, prosecutors alleged.\n \n\n   \n  Days after the arrest, Lexington Avenue thrummed with ordinary life. The house where prosecutors say the games took place stood quiet, no one coming in or out for hours. Late risers in pajamas walked their dogs, two men squabbled over a parking spot, and neighbors and shopkeepers went about their routines.\n \n\n   \n  True to New York grit, the owner of a corner bodega and smoke shop remained indifferent, leaning on the counter, unfazed.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t excite me. Come on, we live in the city. S**t happens every day,” the owner, who chose to go by “AK” for his safety, told CNN. His family in India, he says, worked in politics and often had run-ins with their own “Indian Mafia.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve seen a lot more than what they’re talking about here,” he says. No neighbors CNN spoke to said they knew anything, which did not surprise him. “They’re too rich to be seen like that.”\n \n\n   \n  A woman steps in to pay for a bottle of water, eavesdropping on the conversation. She said she had no idea Mafia members had played poker in the apartment building next door to hers, as prosecutors have alleged.\n \n\n   \n  She was shocked for a moment when she discovered the news, then shrugged. “I’m not scared. What are they gonna do to me?”\n \n\n   \n  In the neighborhood, nicknamed “Curry Hill,” dozens of Indian restaurants, grocery stores, and vintage shops are clustered along 27th and 28th streets, their doors spilling the fragrant heat of simmering spices into the air.\n \n\n   \n  At Curry in a Hurry, Sajjad Chowdhury ladles steaming goat curry into a bowl for a customer while reflecting on the news the very building where investigators say the high-stakes poker games took place is just a block away.\n \n\n   \n  “This restaurant has been here for 50 years. There have been no issues regarding the Mafia, and every restaurant here will say the same,” Chowdhury says. “They live in the shadows. Their presence isn’t obvious.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s 18 now, but growing up in New York, he’s absorbed the stories of the city’s darker decades when the Mafia-run streets were rougher, meaner, and the city ran on fear.\n \n\n   \n  “Things are different now. It doesn’t scare me,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Outside, the aroma of turmeric, cardamom, and garam masala mingles with the sweet haze of incense drifting down the street and masking the underworld accused of hiding just around the corner.\n \n\n   \n  The city may have changed, but its shadows haven’t, and its oldest secrets still live between the cracks of its neighborhoods.\n \n\n   \n    Welcome to Manhattan’s hidden games of poker\n \n\n   \n  A mischievous monkey sketched in chalk perches beneath the sign outside Sally’s Bar, taunting passersby: “Having a s**t day? Grab a BEER.”\n \n\n   \n  Inside, slumped on a worn red leather bar stool and cradling a beer, Sally’s regular Scott Hernandez admits he is indeed having a difficult day, then dives into his account of Manhattan’s hidden poker underworld.\n \n\n   \n  “Those games are everywhere,” he says. “If I wanted to find one today I could.”\n \n\n   \n  A stone’s throw from where he’s drinking, surveillance footage showed two Mafia members charged in the case regularly stopping by Sally’s Bar, just meters from the Lexington Avenue building where the rigged poker games took place. Sally’s itself was not connected to the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Entry to the games is strictly by invitation or through a friend with connections, he explains. The tables vary in size but rarely have fewer than five players. Hernandez said the stakes are high: For ordinary folks, buy-ins run into the thousands, and for the wealthy, the price only climbs higher.\n \n\n   \n  The idea the victims of the rigged games were lured in by celebrities, in this case allegedly NBA athletes, is common sense to Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  Billups and Jones were dubbed “Face Cards,” professional athletes whose mere presence in the  rigged games offered star power meant to legitimize the games to “attract victims,” according to a detention letter written to the judge.\n \n\n   \n  For a lot of people, it’s the whole point of poker, he says.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a way for you to be seen. They’re nobodies, then they’re offered to meet NBA players, and they feel like a somebody. It’s sad,” he says. “It’s about bragging rights, it’s an alpha thing. Like, ‘I went and hung out with the mob.’”\n \n\n   \n  Former Gambino crime family mobster Louis Ferrante used to play those games too, before spending nearly nine years in prison for heists and hijackings, he tells CNN in a phone interview from Florida.\n \n\n   \n  “These normal people accidentally fall into a world they don’t belong in,” Ferrante says in a thick, unmistakable Italian-New York accent, each word rolling out with a stubborn gravitas.\n \n\n   \n  “Either they’re infatuated by the mob, and they’re that stupid to be hanging out with them, not knowing that they’re going to dig their claws into them at some point, or they think, ‘I’m a nobody, and people want to hang out with me?’”\n \n\n   \n  Poker games in New York City aren’t a corporate operation, rather it’s “more like you know a guy who knows a guy,” Ferrante, who authored  The Borgata Trilogy , says. They could be held inside restaurants after closing, in someone’s penthouse apartment, or in makeshift “casinos,” like the one Ferrante started in the basement of a friend’s deli back in the day.\n \n\n   \n  But no matter the room’s glamour or the famous faces gracing the table, Ferrante warns: some men deal in darkness, and sitting with them is like stepping into a trap you can’t see until it snaps shut.\n \n\n   \n  “These guys are predators, everybody’s prey to them,” he says. “They’re not the type of guys to invite into your house for lunch.”\n \n\n   \n    The Mafia never left New York, it just moved upstairs\n \n\n   \n  Today, New York’s streets gleam with glass towers and boutique cafés. But if you look closely, the Mafia’s mystique and menace still linger.\n \n\n   \n  Greenwich Village still wears its history like a second skin, every street a pulse of old New York. Jazz seeps from Blue Note, meeting in the street to mingle with the fragrance of espressos and cappuccinos from Caffè Reggio, while men in Washington Square Park drift through clouds of smoke from their joints.\n \n\n   \n  In the heart of this neighborhood’s restless pulse, a Washington Place apartment, linked to the Gambinos, harbored the same secret rigged poker games, according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The  $17 million townhouse , with its polished doors and celebrity past, perches just blocks from the walls of the former  Triangle Civic Improvement Association social club , the old nerve center of the Genovese family, once under the iron grip of Vincent “The Chin” Gigante, but now a tea shop.\n \n\n   \n  From the 1950s through the 1980s, New York’s streets ran thick with the Mafia’s ironfisted rule. Racketeering and loan sharking were just the surface; beneath it lurked brutal enforcement: kneecappings in dark alleyways, car bombs sending shrapnel into unsuspecting storefronts, and bodies dumped in rivers or abandoned lots to rot as warnings.\n \n\n   \n  But the world changed. The RICO Act. Wiretaps. FBI surveillance vans parked across from Italian bakeries. By the late 1990s, the mob’s influence, along with the swagger, the social clubs and the handshakes on Mulberry Street, had diminished.\n \n\n   \n  Former undercover FBI agent Joe Cantamessa, who served as a “black bag man,” trained to install hidden cameras and microphones where suspects lived, worked and hung out, told CNN while the Mafia’s grip on New York City has waned significantly, they’ve discovered new ways to stay in business.\n \n\n   \n  “The competition for illicit activities is high, and their ability to operate in those other circles of labor racketeering is a little bit more complicated,” Cantamessa said.\n \n\n   \n  “Now they’ll get involved with drugs, prostitution, loan sharking, to an extent, and gambling is still a very resourceful component when they can do that right.”\n \n\n   \n  Cantamessa, widely recognized as a key figure in dismantling New York’s most powerful organized crime families, said he was taken aback by just how technologically advanced the rigged poker games had become.\n \n\n   \n  In the rigged games, players were unknowingly seated at tables equipped with hidden X-ray cameras that could read facedown cards, while rigged shuffling machines were engineered to predict which players had the best hands and alert off-site operators, who signaled to accomplices through subtle gestures, the indictment stated.\n \n\n   \n  The scheme also involved marked cards visible only through “specially designed contact lens or sunglasses,” the indictment said, and officials said defendants also used electronic poker chip trays that tracked the game.\n \n\n   \n  In the earlier days, the mob wasn’t just an underworld, it was infrastructure. They controlled garbage routes, construction sites, garment factories, even the price of concrete pouring into the city’s high-rises.\n \n\n   \n  But still, like an echo that fades but never completely quiets, their presence threads through the alleys like smoke, gone before you trace where it came from.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5585083","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"15:50:00-04:00","title":"Judge indefinitely halts shutdown layoffs noting human toll","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in San Francisco has indefinitely halted the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of federal workers during the government shutdown, ruling that such reductions-in-force (RIFs) are unlawful because they occur during a lapse in appropriations, not a removal of statutory authority.

      \n      \n\n         A federal judge in San Francisco has indefinitely halted the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees tied to the government shutdown. The decision came almost two weeks after U.S. District Judge Susan Illston  temporarily paused thousands of layoffs , known as RIFs, or reductions-in-force, at agencies where the federal employee unions that brought the lawsuit, including the American Federation of Government Employees, have members or bargaining units. In court on Tuesday, an attorney representing the Trump administration pushed back, asserting that the executive branch can conduct RIFs before, during or after a lapse in Congressional appropriations to achieve the president's policy priorities — and that it's good policy to do so. \"If you don't have money coming in, you should be looking for ways to cut costs,\" argued Michael Velchik, an attorney with the Justice Department. The plaintiffs' attorney, Danielle Leonard, countered that a lapse in appropriations is not the same thing as an elimination of statutory authority, and that the government cannot simply tell agencies they no longer need to comply with Congressional mandates. She further argued that the government had violated federal law by ordering employees to work on RIFs during the shutdown. In the days since Illston first issued her temporary restraining order, the two sides have haggled over its scope. The Trump administration  initially determined  it did not apply to most of the roughly  4,000 federal employees who have received layoff notices  since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, including those working for the Treasury Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Illston later modified the order, including by broadening it to cover six additional unions. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Tuesday, Illston said she believed the unions were likely to prove that the Trump administration's actions were unlawful, but she appeared to pull back slightly on the scope of her order. She said she would hold another hearing to determine whether some of the RIFs announced since the shutdown began, including at the Interior Department and the Education Department, were in fact related to the lapse in appropriations. Whatever comes of President Trump's latest attempts to slash the federal workforce, it's clear that the administration's modus operandi — taking sweeping and legally questionable actions to swiftly eliminate jobs — is taking a toll on workers, a point Illston underscored in court on Tuesday. In her opening remarks, Illston read from several of the declarations submitted by employees who have received layoff notices since Oct. 1, including an  Air Force veteran and longtime federal employee  who wrote that she had never gone through anything as traumatizing as what she's going through now — including during her combat deployment. \"Human lives are being dramatically affected by the activities we're discussing,\" Illston said. For many of those receiving layoff notices amid the shutdown, it's not the first time the Trump administration has tried to fire them. In  one testimony filed with the court , Mayra Medrano, a program analyst with the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency and a member of the National Federation of Federal Employees, wrote that she first received a RIF notice in April with an effective termination date of May 9 before being reinstated by court order in June. \"The constant threat of being fired, which has persisted for months, has caused me tremendous physical and mental distress,\" she wrote, elaborating that she experienced a severe stress-induced seizure while on administrative leave this spring. She wrote that she now feels as if she's reliving that nightmare. \"Receiving a RIF notice during the government shutdown, on top of the previous RIF, has been traumatic and it will have a lasting impact on my health,\" she wrote. \"It doesn't feel as though the administration thought about or cared about that long-lasting impact.\" Medrano did not respond to NPR's request for further comment.  In the initial hearing in the case two weeks ago, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard pointed to comments made by White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought before Trump's re-election. In a private speech in 2023  surfaced by ProPublica , Vought, who is now largely seen as the force behind the shutdown layoffs, said he wanted government bureaucrats to be \"traumatically affected\" to the point of not wanting to go to work. \"That's exactly what they are doing,\" Leonard told the court. In an interview with  The Charlie Kirk Show  before Illston blocked the layoffs, Vought said more than 10,000 people could receive RIF notices during the shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Still, that amounts to only a fraction of the federal employees who have been fired since Trump returned to the White House in January. Back in August, Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year, noting that 80% of those departures were voluntary. That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates. Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, according to OPM.

to cut interest rates as job market shows signs of weakness \n         By Scott Horsley \n        \n           Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday, as policymakers work to shore up the softening job market.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That would be the Fed's second rate cut in six weeks, after holding rates steady for much of the year in an effort to curb stubborn inflation.   Prices are still climbing faster than the central bank would like, but for now, policymakers are more concerned with preventing a big jump in unemployment.  A number of prominent corporations have announced job cuts in recent days.  Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate positions.  (Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR and pays to distribute some of our content.)  Target said last week it's cutting about 1000 corporate jobs and leaving another 800 jobs unfilled.  And the federal government cut about 100,000 jobs in the first eight months of the year, with many more workers expected to drop off the federal payroll in October.  Government shutdown clouds economic outlook The Fed's job is complicated by the government shutdown, which has choked off much of the official data used to track the economy.  A report on September's job gains is  nearly a month overdue . And there's a question about whether October's job growth will be tallied at all.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Labor Department did produce one official economic report last week, showing  inflation in September was slightly milder  than forecasters had expected.  That reinforced expectations that inflation concerns will take a backseat to worries about faltering job growth. \"My focus is on the labor market,\" Fed Governor Chris Waller said earlier this month.  \"Payroll gains have weakened this year and employment may well be shrinking already.\"  Waller says that while President Trump's tariffs are putting some upward pressure on prices, he does not expect long-lasting effects on inflation.   In the absence of official government data, analysts are looking to alternative tea leaves for signs of which way the economy is moving.  On Tuesday, the payroll processing company ADP reported a modest uptick in private-sector hiring during the four weeks ending in mid-October.  ADP's jobs numbers often differ, however, from the official government tallies.   \"We're seeing some improvement, but that improvement is tepid, and it is preliminary,\" said ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson.  \"As the weeks progress, we might see further weakness.\"   Weaker job market could weigh on spending  So long as workers are earning paychecks, they can continue to spend, but if job growth stalls and layoffs jump, that could become a drag on the broader economy.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The reason why consumers have been so resilient is the labor market has been relatively strong,\" Richardson says.  \"It's not glorious.  Some of the momentum that we saw early in the year has slowed down. But overall we are seeing enough strength to keep consumer spending steady.\"   Unemployment inched up over the summer, but there's been no official tally of the unemployment rate for September or October.   That's led Waller to rely more heavily on anecdotal reports from business contacts, which offers a mixed picture.  \"Employers indicate to me that there was some further softening in the labor market last month, while retailers report continued solid spending,\" Waller said.   Much of that spending may be driven by wealthy Americans who are less dependent on weekly paychecks, but a clearer picture will not be available until the government resumes releasing economic data. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589165","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:34:00-04:00","title":"This furloughed IRS lawyer is living out his dream of being a hot dog vendor","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Isaac Stein, a former IRS lawyer, turned to a hot dog stand business during a government shutdown, launching 'Shysters Dogs' in Washington, D.C. with a humorous, rule-based menu that includes a 'correct' hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut and a 10% tax for 'wrong toppings.'

Normally, he's a lawyer for the IRS who writes tax regulations. But on a sunny Sunday afternoon on a corner in his Washington, D.C. neighborhood, he's wearing a suit and tie, working his hot dog stand, \"Shysters Dogs.\" Its motto: \"the only honest ripoff in DC.\" \"I am having a grand old time slinging hot dogs,\" Stein said.

While his classmates enjoyed playing basketball, he said, he had more fun manning the concessions stand. This summer, he decided he wanted to open a hot dog business of his very own. \"I got all the permits in late September, and then I was furloughed on October 8th,\" Stein said. So with his newly free time, the side project he started before the shutdown turned into a seven-days-a-week gig. It's a simple menu: a \"correct hot dog,\" or a \"hot dog with the wrong toppings.\" \"I'm trying to incentivize people to do what I think a correct hot dog is, which is mustard and sauerkraut,\" Stein said. \"If someone wants other things, that's totally, totally fine. No judgment. But I do reserve the right to assess an additional dollar as a penalty.\" The rest of the menu is similarly cheeky, including RC Cola (which Stein thinks is the best cola), MoonPies, dog treats and branded stickers. He offers a 5 cent discount for customers who \"briefly recite the historical significance of MoonPies and/or RC Cola.\" Also available on the menu: \"SHIRT OFF MY BACK\". \"If someone coughs up a solid grand, I will literally strip half naked, take the shirt off my back, call it a day and walk home,\" Stein said.

He's looking forward to getting back to his IRS job as soon as possible. \"But I'm definitely not giving this up,\" Stein said. \"This is going to be a weekend project, I think, for life.\" He hopes it can bring a laugh to the community — even if he has to charge you a 10% tax for ordering a dog with the \"wrong toppings.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589220","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-04:00","title":"These doctors want to break the cycle of shame and blame in medicine","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a growing movement among medical professionals to combat the pervasive culture of shame in healthcare.

Bynum, then in his second year of residency training as a family medicine physician, was wrapping up a long shift when he was called into an emergency delivery. To save the baby's life, he used a vacuum device, which applies suction to assist with rapid delivery. The baby emerged unharmed. But the mother suffered a severe vaginal tear that required surgical repair by an obstetrician. Soon afterward, Bynum retreated to an empty hospital room, trying to process his feelings about the unexpected complication. \"I didn't want to see anybody. I didn't want anybody to find me,\" said Bynum, now an  associate professor of family medicine  at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina. \"It was a really primitive response.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Shame is a common and highly uncomfortable human emotion. In the years since, Bynum has become a  leading voice  among clinicians and researchers who argue that the intense crucible of medical training can amplify shame in future doctors. He is now part of an emerging effort to teach what he describes as \" shame competence \" to medical school students and practicing physicians. While shame can't be eliminated, Bynum and his research colleagues maintain that related skills and practices can reduce the culture of shame and foster a healthier way to engage with it. Without this approach, they argue, tomorrow's doctors won't recognize and address the emotion in themselves and others. And thus, they risk transmitting it to their patients, even inadvertently, which may  worsen their health . Shaming patients can backfire, Bynum said, making them defensive and leading to isolation and sometimes substance use. Blame the patients The U.S. political environment presents an additional obstacle to changing the culture of shame. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top Trump administration health officials have  publicly blamed  autism, diabetes, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other chronic issues in large part on the lifestyle choices of people with the conditions — or their parents. For instance, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested in a Fox News interview that more diabetes could be treated with cooking classes instead of \" just throwing insulin at people .\"  Even before the political shift, that attitude was reflected at doctors' offices as well. A 2023 study found that  one-third of physicians reported feeling repulsed  when treating patients with Type 2 diabetes, which is sometimes linked to obesity. About 44% viewed those patients as lacking motivation to make lifestyle changes, while 39% said they tended to be lazy. \"We don't like feeling shame. We want to avoid it. It's very uncomfortable,\" said  Michael Jaeb , a nurse at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has  conducted a review  of related studies, published in 2024. And if the source of shame is from the clinician, the patient may ask, \"'Why would I go back?' In some cases, that patient may generalize that to the whole health care system.\" Indeed, some patients, like Christa Reed have avoided doctors because of this. Reed dropped out of regular medical care for two decades, weary of weight-related lectures. \"I was told when I was pregnant that my morning sickness was because I was a plus-size, overweight woman,\" she said. Except for a few urgent medical issues, such as an infected cut, Reed avoided health care providers. \"Because going into a doctor for an annual visit would be pointless,\" said the now 45-year-old Minneapolis-area wedding photographer. \"They would only just tell me to lose weight.\" Then, last year, severe jaw pain drove Reed to seek specialty care. A routine blood pressure check showed a sky-high reading, sending her to the emergency room. \"They said, 'We don't know how you're walking around normal,'\" she recounted. Since then, Reed has found supportive physicians with expertise in nutrition. Her blood pressure remains under control with medication. She's also nearly 100 pounds below her heaviest weight, and she hikes, bikes, and lifts weights to build muscle. A \"masochistic\" work ethic Savannah Woodward , a California psychiatrist, is among a group of physicians trying to bring attention to the detrimental effects of shame and develop strategies to prevent and mitigate it. While this effort is in the early stages, she co-led a session on the spiral of shame at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in May. If physicians don't acknowledge shame in themselves, they can risk depression,  burnout , sleeping difficulties, and other ripple effects that erode patient care, she said. \"We often don't talk about how important the human connection is in medicine,\" Woodward said. \"But if your doctor is burned out or feeling like they don't deserve to be your doctor, patients feel that. They can tell.\" In a survey conducted this year, 37% of graduating students  reported feeling publicly embarrassed  at some point in medical school, and nearly 20% described public humiliation, according to an annual survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Medical students and physician residents are already prone to perfectionism, along with an almost \"masochistic\" work ethic, as Woodward described it. Then they're run a gantlet of exams and years of training, amid constant scrutiny and with patients' lives on the line. During training, physicians work in teams and make presentations to teaching faculty about a patient's medical issues and their recommended treatment approach. \"You trip over your words. You miss things. You get things out of order. You go blank,\" Bynum said. And then shame creeps in, he said, leading to other debilitating thoughts, such as \"'I'm no good at this. I'm an idiot. Everyone around me would have done this so much better.'\" Yet shame remains \"a crack in your armor, that you don't want to show,\" said  Karly Pippitt , a family medicine physician at the University of Utah who has taught medical students about the potential for shame as part of a broader ethics and humanities course. \"You're taking care of a human life,\" she said. \"Heaven forbid that you act like you're not capable or you show fear.\" Stop the shame cycle When teaching students about shame, the goal is to help future physicians recognize the emotion in themselves and others, so they don't perpetuate the cycle, Pippitt said. \"If you felt shamed throughout your medical education, it normalizes that as the experience,\" she said. Above all, physicians-in-training can work to reframe their mindset when they receive a poor grade or struggle to master a new skill, said Woodward, the California psychiatrist. Instead of believing that they've failed as a physician, they can focus on what they got wrong and ways to improve. Last year, Bynum started teaching Duke physicians about shame competence, beginning with roughly 20 OB-GYN physician residents. This year, he launched a larger initiative with  The Shame Lab , a research and training partnership between Duke University and the University of Exeter in England that he co-founded, to reach about 300 people across Duke's Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, including faculty and physician residents. This sort of training is rare among Duke OB-GYN resident  Canice Dancel 's peers in other programs.

October 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. The school day is just getting started, and four-year-old Vasiliki Vourgou, a little girl with dark eyes and hair pulled back in a shiny ponytail with a hot pink scrunchie, is alone. Most days, there are two pupils in this small classroom on the Greek island of Lemnos, with big windows and a view of the school's front courtyard. But one student is sick, so today it's just Vasiliki, going through the morning routine with her teacher. The sky is gray, but Vasiliki's teacher says when the weather is nice, she tries to get the girls outside, to interact with the older children, during their breaks. \"They wait for the kids from the primary school to get out and they join them also, so they can be more social,\" the teacher, Maria Kokkinopliti, said through an interpreter. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Lemnos, in the northern Aegean, is home to roughly 16,000 people spread across a few dozen small villages. Vasiliki's school, in the small village of Thanos, is one of many in Greece that's facing declining student numbers, as younger people move away, and those who stay have fewer children. Vasiliki's father, Stelios Vourgos, works long hours as a shepherd, but he can't imagine raising Vasiliki and her baby brother anywhere else. \"Here, I fell in love with my wife; here is my job,\" Vourgos said through an interpreter. \"For the kids, it's a paradise to be raised on an island, because big cities are like a jungle.\" But the way of life here faces increasing challenges. The primary school in the village where his wife grew up was shuttered decades ago, he said. He attended the same school in Thanos where Vasiliki is now a student, as did his father. But now he worries it will be shut down. Without a thriving school, he said, there won't be much left here. \"There's a chain reaction after [a school closes], so people move into different places, and then just the old people are left there, and you see villages disappearing,\" Vourgos said. Across most of the world, people are having far fewer children than their parents and grandparents did. Greece's birthrate is  about 1.3 births  per woman — well below the 2.1 level needed to maintain the population.  The low birthrate is especially visible in rural communities like Thanos and on Greek islands like Lemnos, where hundreds of schools are cutting programs or closing. Nationwide, Greece's education ministry announced more than 700  schools would close  this year alone, or about 5% of the nation's schools. \"The island's infrastructure and available services are also affected, plus limited employment opportunities,\" Konstantinos Maditinos, president of the primary education teachers' association on Lemnos, said. \"This means young couples have little incentive to stay on the island and leave, even if they are originally from here.\" For those who stay, healthcare services can be limited. Vourgos said he and his wife spent thousands of euros to travel for medical care for each of her two pregnancies. The island's small public hospital has no neonatal ICU services, so many pregnant women make that choice, said Dr. Olga Katira. She has been working as a pediatrician on Lemnos for more than a decade. Katira said she's noticed the birth rate shift in her own office. \"We used to have six, seven newborns per month, and now we have three,\" she said. \"That is a decline that we can see.\" While the problem is more pronounced in Greece's small towns and island communities, Katira worries about the future of the country as a whole. \"We are a small country, if it continues declining it will be very, very difficult,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As families have had fewer children or left the island, the population of Lemnos has plummeted by more than a third since the early 1950s, from a peak of more than 27,000 people to about 16,000 in the most recent Census. The mayor of Lemnos, Eleonora Georga, said shuttered schools around the island are one of the most obvious signs of the decline. Switching back and forth between English and Greek, Georga said the overall population here is getting smaller, and older. \"It's the contemporary lifestyle of the people nowadays. They're not choosing to create families anymore,\" she said through an interpreter. In September, the Greek government announced new tax incentives designed to address the birth rate decline.   Georga said she also would like the European Union to intervene. Asked if she thinks more immigration to Greek islands like Lemnos could also be a solution, she hesitated. \"It depends on who,\" she said. In recent years, Greece has seen a  sharp increase  in the number of migrants traveling from eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East — as Europe has seen waves of anti-immigrant protests. Georga said she'd rather see Greeks who've left the country move back. Those worries are shared by Angelos Vlapas, the principal of another local primary school on Lemnos, who said he's concerned about what immigration means for Greek identity. \"We're not criticizing the people who came here to make a living,\" Vlapas said through an interpreter. \"On the contrary, those who have remained…have become valuable members of the local community.\" \"However, that doesn't change the fact that they belong to a different nationality.\" Alexandra Tragaki, a professor of economic demography at Harokopion University of Athens, said modern women are having fewer children in part because they've taken on responsibilities in the workplace without having traditional, domestic responsibilities proportionately reduced. \"Women changed roles, but no one else did,\" Tragaki said. \"Neither the society, nor men, so part of the roles that used to be covered by women were left uncovered. And when that happens, obviously it's the size of the family that is affected…So obviously, when you have both things to do, parenting and working, what you cut down is the number of children you parent.\" Tragaki said many young Greeks — who grew up at a time when the country was struggling under a catastrophic economic downturn — worry about their own future. \"They have been brought up in consecutive crises,\" Tragaki said. \"They were born in crisis. They were brought up in financial crisis, in energy crisis, in pandemic crisis. So what they have learned is that they need to expect the unexpected.\" The idea that the culture around family life is shifting in a profound way also resonates with longtime residents of another smaller island, Fourni. The island, nearly 200 miles southeast of Lemnos across the Aegean Sea, is home to roughly a thousand people, depending on the time of year.  On a sunny, clear morning, a group of elderly men sit outside a small local market, under the flawless blue sky. Parthenios Flytzanis, 92, and Nikolaos Amorgianos, 86, are reminiscing about the past, and through an interpreter, say they worry about the country's future. \"In 10 years, Greece will be a country of old people,\" Amorgianos said. Amorgianos believes younger generations are choosing to have fewer children because their values have changed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Now the young people, they only care about the bars, about going out, and they've abandoned the mountains, they've abandoned the countryside,\" he said . Flytzanis agreed. He believes women in particular have changed. \"Women back then had 5, 6, 7 children,\" he said. \"And they still took care of the goats, and the garden.\" \"The chickens,\" Amorgianos added. Amorgianos remembers his mother making her own bread, but now he believes younger people want everything to be convenient. \"So yes, life has become easier, and people have gotten lazier,\" he said. Women today have more choices, but for those who choose to raise children on a remote island, that choice comes with its own difficulties.   Katerina Vrana lives on an even smaller island neighboring Fourni, Thymaina, with her husband and their three children. Through an interpreter, Vrana says she and her husband were both born and raised on the island. He's a fisherman, and she owns a restaurant. For her first two pregnancies, Vrana said she paid thousands of euros to travel off the island to see doctors and deliver her babies. She wanted another child, she said, but hesitated because of the cost. Then, she found out about HOPEgenesis, an Athens-based nonprofit that pays for medical care and transportation for pregnant women from small islands and villages. It's funded largely with corporate and philanthropic support. Through an interpreter, Vrana said the program allowed her to make her \"dream\" of a third child \"reality.\" HOPEgenesis started by working with women in Fourni a decade ago and has since expanded services to some 500 small villages and island communities, in an effort to help reverse the declining birthrate. \"When they felt secure, when they felt they had financial support, women started having babies again,\" project manager with HOPEgenesis Eva Papadaki said. But even with that financial help to have children, raising them on small islands is challenging. The primary school on Thymaina is down to just two grade-school students. There's no school for Vrana's two older children, who travel to Fourni for secondary school by ferry. This year, Vrana said her youngest son would have been the only child in Thymaina's kindergarten, so she's decided to send him by boat to Fourni, to the kindergarten that serves all of that island's children, so he won't be alone. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many days, Vrana and her son ride the ferry to Fourni for school, along with his older siblings and a few others. One of the secondary students, 16-year-old Georgia Gramatikou, said sometimes in the winter the weather is too dangerous for her and her twin brother to make the crossing and go to school. While Georgia enjoys her island home, she doesn't think she'll stay here. \"It's very nice here, and it's peaceful, but I don't see myself living here in the future because there aren't many opportunities,\" she said through an interpreter. People are slowly leaving the island, she said, and the shops are closing. Back on Fourni, Dimitris Markakis, a local business owner and city official, says family life has always been important in Greece, but it was once seen as essential. Many families were poor, he says, but they saw having children as a source of happiness, \"as the meaning of the life.\" Markakis is in his mid-40s, with two children. He left the island to study abroad before returning to start his family. He thinks the stresses of modern life are one reason people are having fewer children. Still, Markakis said, his people are strong, and he is hopeful. \"Greek people are very hard, and they always face problems with responsibility,\" he says. \"I am optimistic.\" Kleitia Kokalari and NPR's  Brian Mann  contributed to this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95504","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"01:34:00-04:00","title":"Huge Brazilian raid on Rio gang leaves at least 64 people dead and 81 under arrest","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A large-scale police raid conducted in Rio de Janeiro on October 29, 2025, targeted the Red Command drug-trafficking gang in the favelas of Complexo do Alemão and Penha, resulting in at least 64 deaths — 60 suspects and four police officers — and 81 arrests.

least 64 people dead and 81 under arrest \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 1:34 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         RIO DE JANEIRO — About 2,500 Brazilian police and soldiers launched a massive raid on a drug-trafficking gang in Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday, arresting 81 suspects and sparking shootouts that left at least 60 suspects and four police officers dead, officials said. The operation included officers in helicopters and armored vehicles and targeted the notorious Red Command in the sprawling low-income favelas of Complexo de Alemao and Penha, police said. The police operation was one of the most violent in Brazil's recent history, with human rights organizations calling for investigations into the deaths. Rio's state Gov. Claudio Castro said in a video posted on X that 60 criminal suspects were \"neutralized\" during the massive raid that he called the biggest such operation in the city's history. Some 81 suspects were arrested, while 93 rifles and more than half a ton of drugs were seized, the state government said, adding that those killed \"resisted police action.\" Rio's civil police said on X that four officers died in Tuesday's operation. \"The cowardly attacks by criminals against our agents will not go unpunished,\" it said. An unknown number of people were wounded. The United Nations' human rights body said it was \"horrified\" by the deadly police operation, called for effective investigations and reminded authorities of their obligations under international human rights law. César Muñoz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called Tuesday's events \"a huge tragedy\" and a \"disaster.\" \"The public prosecutor's office must open its own investigations and clarify the circumstances of each death,\" Muñoz said in a statement. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Footage on social media showed fire and smoke rising from the two favelas as gunfire rang out. The city's Education Department said 46 schools across the two neighborhoods were closed, and the nearby Federal University of Rio de Janeiro canceled night classes and told people on campus to seek shelter. Suspected gang members blocked roads in northern and southeastern Rio in response to the raid, local media reported. At least 70 buses were commandeered to be used in the blockades, causing significant damage, the city's bus organization Rio Onibus said. The operation Tuesday followed a year of investigation into the criminal group, police said. Gov. Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime — a swipe at the administration of leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Gleisi Hoffmann, the Lula administration's liaison with the parliament, agreed that coordinated action was needed but pointed to a recent crackdown on money laundering as an example of the federal government's action on organized crime. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and a number of ministers met in response to the operation on Tuesday afternoon. Chief of Staff Rui Costa requested an emergency meeting in Rio on Wednesday, with him in attendance as well as Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski. Emerging from Rio's prisons, the Red Command criminal gang has expanded its control in favelas in recent years. Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio's Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela. While the Tuesday's police operation was similar to previous ones, its scale was unprecedented, said Luis Flavio Sapori, a sociologist and public safety expert at Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. \"What's different about today's operation is the magnitude of the victims. These are war numbers,\" he said. He argued that these kinds of operations are inefficient because they do not tend to catch the masterminds, but rather target underlings who can later be replaced. \"It's not enough to go in, exchange gunfire, and leave. There's a lack of strategy in Rio de Janeiro's public security policy,\" Sapori said. \"Some lower-ranking members of these factions are killed, but those individuals are quickly replaced by others.\" The Marielle Franco Institute, a nonprofit founded by the slain councilwoman 's family to continue her legacy of fighting for the rights of people living in favelas, also criticized the operation. \"This is not a public safety policy. It's a policy of extermination, that makes the everyday life of Black and poor people a Russian roulette,\" it said in a statement. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95373","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Camouflaging cars and swapping license plates: How agents make immigration arrests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article investigates a growing pattern of covert immigration enforcement by federal agents, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol, who are using unmarked vehicles, masking their identities, and swapping or altering license plates during public arrests.

More people in tactical police vests get inside the vehicle, as an angry crowd forms around it, yelling profanities. \"You guys are separating families,\" one woman shouts at the car, which is flashing red and blue lights. \"And for what?\" The woman tells others not to come near the area because \"la migra\" is there, which is how some Spanish speakers refer to U.S. immigration authorities. But there is little to reveal whether the Ford belongs to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agency that is leading President Trump's push for mass arrests and deportations of those suspected of being in the U.S. without legal status, or any other federal unit tasked with carrying out immigration-related arrests. The car has  no license plates  on the back and appears to have no words on the side that indicate it is government property. Over the past year, many   federal law enforcement agents conducting immigration arrests have been concealing their faces under masks and gaiters when making arrests in public, in what DHS says is an effort to avoid doxing, or publishing agents' personal information online. Dozens of  pending proposals across the country  now seek to ban masking of federal policing authorities in public places. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Less public attention has centered on the   masking of agents' cars. But some vehicles being used in what appear to be immigration-related arrests do not have license plates, or have traded license plates,   NPR found in a review of videos shot by bystanders and reporters, and those circulating on social media. The videos appear to come   from areas where the administration has focused its immigration enforcement across the country, including Illinois, California and Washington state. Witnesses and  activists  have alleged similar behavior concerning license plates in  court filings  and in media reports, while the  Illinois Secretary of State , a Democrat, has condemned the apparent trading of license plates as illegal in his state. NPR sent several requests for comment to ICE citing the specific photos and videos that appear to show license plate removal or manipulation during immigration enforcement operations. The department did not respond to the specific examples. Immigration advocates say that as the agency increases its presence across the country thanks to an  infusion of cash from Congress , untraceable vehicles may add to confusion over what tactics immigration officers can or should be using, and could prevent people from holding officers accountable. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Most people are not used to interacting with federal law enforcement on our streets,\" said Bruno Huizar, policy manager at the California Immigrant Policy Center. Not knowing the identity of law enforcement – or not knowing if the enforcement is legitimate – exacerbates lack of trust in police, and makes it harder for people to defend their legal rights, he said. Officers who appeared to be conducting immigration arrests in unmarked vehicles were captured on videos shot across the country and shared online on platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Eyes Up, an application that tracks where federal agents have arrested migrants. NPR reviewed all videos cited in this story and confirmed the dates of the videos and locations of law enforcement presence and bystanders when possible. When details couldn't be verified, NPR corroborated information with immigration experts, activists, and a developer for an app that documents confrontations with federal agents. In a  video  shared in June that takes place in Washington state, a federal agent in a police vest is seen driving   a black Ford SUV with no license plate on the back of the vehicle. And in another  video  posted on the Eyes Up app, labeled as shot in July in a Los Angeles suburb,   a blue Nissan is seen   with a placard on the back of the car that reads \"Lexus of Valencia\"   in the space where a license plate is usually placed. The vehicle is seen parked near others   that federal agents were seen using while detaining a person. NPR asked ICE to confirm whether these vehicles and others like them belonged to federal employees working for the agency. The agency did not respond. In an earlier statement provided in response to questions about the vehicle with the \"Lexus of Valencia\" placard, ICE spokesperson Mike Alvarez told NPR in a statement that ICE officers and agents do not use personal or rental vehicles while conducting immigration enforcement operations. \"Further,  per federal code , federal law enforcement agency vehicles used primarily for investigative, law enforcement, intelligence, or security duties are exempt from displaying U.S. Government license plates or motor vehicle identification when such identification would interfere with these critical duties,\" Alvarez said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Appearing \"like a ghost\" It used to be rare for ICE employees to drive cars without plates when conducting arrests, said Darius Reeves, a former Baltimore field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. He left the agency this year. \"The agency clearly wants to appear like a ghost,\" Reeves said. \"I have never experienced this.\" The federal code, or  regulation , that Alvarez cited requires that vehicles used by government employees display government license plates on the front and rear of the vehicle – except when identifying these cars would interfere with investigative, law enforcement, intelligence, or security duties. Federal  regulation  also prohibits swapping license plates from one car to another. But  ICE guidelines  for agents on managing vehicle fleets indicate that operating a vehicle without license plates is meant to be the exception, not the rule. \"All ICE owned, or leased motor vehicles must display DHS or [General Services Administration] license plates, unless exempted,\" the guidelines state. To operate a vehicle without a federal license plate, someone must submit a request for a waiver to the unit that manages ICE's fleet, according to the guidelines. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, NPR requested to review all license plate waivers submitted by ICE over the previous year. At the time of publication, ICE had not provided the documents to reporters, though according to the federal Freedom of Information Act, the agency should have provided them by September. An automatic email message received this month stated all federal records offices would not communicate with reporters about records until the end of the \"funding hiatus,\" referring to the shutdown of the federal government that began on October 1. Alvarez, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to a question from NPR about how many times employees had submitted waivers to operate vehicles without a license plate. Removing and swapping license plates Some states prohibit swapping license plates on vehicles. But photos taken by activists and a video shared to social media suggest federal agents are doing this anyway in Illinois and California. A video posted to a TikTok account in October   shows  a man dressed like a federal agent who said that changing license plates on vehicles was standard practice. \"We change the plates out every day,\" says in the video, which was described by the poster as having taken place in Round Lake, Ill., as he walks around an otherwise unmarked black Jeep SUV with an Illinois license plate. On Oct. 22, Illinois Secretary of State  Alexi Giannoulias   posted the video to X , stating that Illinois had \"zero tolerance for this type of illegal activity.\" \"Flipping license plates or altering them in any way to avoid detection is strictly prohibited in Illinois,\" said  Giannoulias  in the video, urging residents to report similar violations to a hotline. \"No one, including a federal agent, is above the law.\" Alvarez, the ICE spokesperson, identified the officers in that video as Border Patrol. A separate agency inside DHS that has been involved with immigration enforcement, Border Patrol has been among the agencies tasked with conducting immigration-related arrests, particularly in  cities like Chicago in recent weeks . Customs and Border Protection, the branch of DHS it is housed within, did not respond to a request for comment from NPR asking about their practice of switching license plates. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Activists for the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, a community group based in Los Angeles, Calif., have said they also noticed behavior that seems to contradict state guidelines about license plates. Since June, the activists say, they have monitored federal agents almost every day as they leave Terminal Island, an artificial island in southern Los Angeles that has been used as a staging area for agents before they arrest migrants and conduct raids throughout the city. More than once, activists documented people on Terminal Island, a part of LA, removing plates from vehicles. \"We've seen that multiple times,\" said Elijah Chiland, an activist with the group. Activists said they have additionally noticed that sometimes, federal agents left the staging area in the same car, but with different license plates on the vehicle than the car had on a previous day. And multiple times, the activists said, they noticed something else: Vehicles departing from Terminal Island were spotted with one license plate on the front and a different plate on the back. \"I've seen seven or eight different times that a car had a license plate that it didn't originally have,\" said Victor Maldonado, another of the group's activists. ICE did not respond to NPR questions about the allegations of license plate-switching near Terminal Island. Mexican markings in Washington and Illinois Some videos shared online appear to show federal agents making arrests using vehicles marked with Mexican objects or icons. In the   video  recorded in Spokane Valley, Wash., where a car without license plates was used, another vehicle drew attention from bystanders. In front of the car without plates, two masked federal agents in tactical vests are seen entering a white Jeep SUV with a back license plate from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. \"Tamaulipas on the license plate, can you believe this?\" says a bystander, who can be heard on the audio in the clip. ICE did not respond to a request for comment asking if this was their vehicle or operation. A similar tactic was observed in a video that appears to be recorded in Illinois and was shared on TikTok in September. In the video,  a man in a tactical police vest  marked with the words \"U.S. Border Patrol\" is seen entering a silver Ford Explorer with a large Mexican flag across the hood of the car. Mexican flag stickers are seen stuck to the car's back and side windows. \"ICE using Mexican flag to target immigrants!!\" read the words typed across the video, shared to TikTok, though it is unclear that anyone working for ICE is in the vehicle. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Another video  shared the same day showed multiple men in tactical vests loading into a vehicle with a similar Mexican flag splayed across the hood. When asked about whether Border Patrol agents were using a vehicle with Mexican flag decals, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated the agency believes its employees are not camouflaging their identities, though she acknowledged agents do wear masks to protect themselves from harm. ICE did not respond. \"DHS is not going to confirm our vehicles and put an even larger target on our officers' backs,\" McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to questions regarding current CBP policy for markings on cars including painted hoods and stickers. Multiple agencies, few agency markings on cars Involvement  of other federal agencies  in immigration activities further complicates the situation, said Reeves, the former ICE employee. Employees of the  Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Park Police have been involved with arresting migrants. But during arrests, the officers' clothing hasn't appeared to always match the cars they drive, according to media reports and NPR's own reporting. In one instance, after President Trump deployed the National Guard to patrol D.C. in early August, a group of officers detained two migrants. The officers' clothing indicated some of them worked for the FBI, ATF and U.S. Park Police, reporters  observed . One person wore a tactical vest labeled \"police.\" Another wore a tactical vest with no description on it at all. A U.S. Park Police vehicle was the only car visible that was labeled with the name of a law enforcement agency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Making arrests while operating cars that aren't clearly identified can erode the public's trust in local police, said Daniel Hodges, a police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington D.C., which has also worked with ICE on immigration arrests in the city. Hodges was attacked during the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \"We've got to live with that destruction of trust after the feds go away,\" said Hodges. \"Ethically and in terms of long-term effectiveness of our police departments, it's only detrimental as far as I can see.\" David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that removing or switching license plates can be detrimental for another reason: It helps federal agencies avoid further scrutiny. \"It removes the opportunity for accountability if you don't know what officers were conducting an operation. There's no way to track back, 'This person was using this vehicle,'\" Bier said. \"It's unclear exactly how they track these actions. So it could genuinely be impossible to ever determine who was involved and in what operation.\" Bier said not knowing which agency or people are involved in an arrest can make it difficult for Congress or lawyers to investigate specific claims if officers are accused of violating people's rights. \"Of course, if you're being charged with a crime or being arrested or detained, you have a right to know who is leveling this charge against you, who's claiming that you violated the law,\" Bier said. \"These are all basic principles of liberal democracy that we've just taken for granted.\" Nick McMillan contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1161394509","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15.123Z","title":"Government Launches Affordable Housing Initiative to Address Urban Housing Crisis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has announced a major new policy aimed at increasing access to affordable housing in urban areas.

Caffeine  is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug  in the world. It's in coffee, chocolate, energy drinks, soda and tea. It stimulates your brain and nervous system and may reduce fatigue and drowsiness.  And we can't get enough of it. According to one study, an estimated  85% of the U.S. population  consumes at least one caffeinated beverage a day.  But is all that caffeine healthy?  It depends. Too much can lead to negative side effects like nervousness or headaches, but research has shown it can also provide positive health benefits too. Coffee, for example, may  protect your liver from cirrhosis  and reduce the risk for  Parkinson's disease . To reap the potential rewards of caffeine consumption, you have to understand what a healthy relationship with caffeine looks like. Experts share a few things to keep in mind:  \n       \n      Related Story:  It's Pretty Easy To Level Up Your Coffee Game — Here's How \n       Caffeine is not a substitute for rest or nutrition  Product marketing has equated caffeine consumption with energy. Indeed, it can make you more alert or focused and improve mood or cognitive performance. However, these effects are not the same as providing energy to your body: only food and rest can do that.  \"Caffeine can never make up for a poor night's sleep. The only thing that can [do that] is more sleep,\" says  Dr. Ugonna Iroku , a gastroenterologist in New York City and an assistant clinical professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Yet far too often, says Iroku, people try to use caffeine as a substitute for adequate rest and nutrition and develop bad habits, like drinking soda at dinner, which can keep people up past their preferred bedtime. So, a friendly reminder: that energy drink might help get you through your afternoon hump – but caffeine can only block that tired feeling for a while.  Caffeine tolerance varies from person to person Have you ever been flabbergasted by that friend who goes for coffee at 10 p.m.? Or gotten jealous of that coworker who only needs a little tea to power through their workday? Marilyn Cornelis , an associate professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says our genes are to thank for habits like these.   \"You're naturally trying to titrate the levels of intake based on your genetics,\" she says. \"Any avid coffee drinker knows what's the latest they can have a cup of coffee before it impacts their sleep.\"  Cornelis' studied the relationship between the human genome and coffee and caffeine consumption for her postdoctoral work. She found that  our appetite and tolerance for caffeine are written in our genetic code  – and some people naturally tend to consume more than others. \"If an individual was genetically predisposed to metabolize caffeine very quickly, they tended to consume more caffeine,\" she says. That means caffeine tolerance can vary from person to person, and in general, says Cornelis, your body knows how much it needs. But that's not a blank check to consume as much as you want. When it comes to your level of caffeine intake, Iroku says to look for signs you might be overdoing it. \"Your body can give you feedback,\" he says. \"Jitteriness, anxiety, a raised pulse [are signs] you're consuming too much.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Busting 5 common myths about water and hydration \n       Caffeine is not considered an addictive substance It's common to think about your \"need\" for your morning coffee or tea as an addiction, but Cornelis says the potential risks associated with caffeine dependence  don't rise to the level of an addictive substance .  You can, however, build up a physical tolerance to, or dependence on, caffeine, she says. If that happens, you'll need to keep ingesting more to get the same kick, and without it, you might experience withdrawal symptoms. It's also possible to misuse caffeine (just like any other drug) by consuming inappropriate levels.  There are also specific populations who should consume far less or abstain entirely, like  children and teenagers ,  pregnant people  and people with certain medical conditions.  If you want to cut back, go slow The U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggests  a maximum of 400 milligrams of caffeine a day  for the average person – that's roughly the amount of caffeine in four, 8-ounce cups of coffee.  If you feel you need to cut back or make a change, Iroku suggests  doing so slowly  to set yourself up for success. Quitting cold turkey can worsen withdrawal symptoms like headaches or jitters and is  associated with a higher failure rate .  When cutting down or making swaps, remember that caffeine is often a part of our social rituals, not just our physical routines. Maybe you just need a fizzy drink at the movies, not a soda. Maybe what you're actually craving is quality time with friends, not the coffee you share at your monthly meetup.

ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   Hey there, Andee Tagle here. Do you know when your relationship with caffeine began? I know exactly when mine started. Years before I became a reporter for LIFE KIT, I worked a graveyard shift. I was a sophomore in college at the time, and it was my duty from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. to sit at a desk at the front of the dorms and check the IDs of everyone who entered the building. Not a whole lot to it. Great gig to get your homework done. The hardest part of the job was staying awake. But lucky for me, my cute little hall monitor desk sat right next to a vending machine stocked with all the best goodies - Pop-Tarts, M&M's, Cup of Noodles and, maybe you've guessed it, energy drinks. That was my beginning. From that summer on, before every test, every deadline, every big interview, really on any just marginally busy day for years, I needed my Monster Zero Ultra. That's the white and silver can for fellow enthusiasts. It was so much a part of my routine, it kind of became a personality trait. Maybe my drink doesn't speak to you specifically, but I'm betting that you can relate. There are millions of adult brains out there that wake up every morning and scream, caffeine, caffeine, caffeine. In fact, a 2022 survey reported that 93% of American adults consume caffeine. Of those, 75% consume caffeine at least once a day. So it's safe to say a bunch of us are stuck on the sauce. But what does that mean for us exactly? MARILYN CORNELIS: Some people, they might think that they need to cut back because they don't like the idea of feeling that they're addicted to something, or they just think that overall, there's - it's better for their health to cut back on caffeine. TAGLE: If you're listening to this, these are probably familiar feelings. Personally, I've gotten a ton of grief from friends and family about all those Monsters. And there's a lot of confusing media out there suggesting that caffeine consumption is something to be curbed, cut out entirely, even feared. But I've got some news for you - caffeine is not the enemy. UGO IROKU: Caffeine has a lot of benefits for the average person, including in the areas that you would have imagined it did it. TAGLE: It's true. In general, when used correctly, caffeine is your friend, not your foe, and has a lot of positive effects to offer you. For one, caffeine is thought to protect your liver from cirrhosis and other liver diseases. CORNELIS: Coffee consumption reduces your risk of Type 2 diabetes. UGO: It's thought that for every one cup of coffee you drink, there's a 3% decreased risk in arrhythmia. TAGLE: For women, caffeine is associated with lower stroke risk. CORNELIS: Coffee and caffeine reduces risk of Parkinson's disease. UGO: We use caffeine to treat, of course, migraine headaches and other types of headache. And the list goes on and on. TAGLE: So in this episode of LIFE KIT - understanding our pal, caffeine. We'll learn how caffeine works and why its effect varies from person to person. We'll do some more myth-busting, and we'll learn how to make sure that your relationship with that morning Joe is a healthy one. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: A quick note up front, friends - this episode features vetted medical research but should not be taken as blanket medical advice. Responsibly consumed caffeine is beneficial for a lot of people, but there are certain populations - like children, pregnant people or people trying to get pregnant, those with certain medical conditions or people who take certain medications - who should abstain from or reduce their caffeine consumption. You should always speak to your doctor if you have questions about your specific needs. OK, first things first, what are we working with exactly? Before we can determine the role caffeine should play in our lives, we need to understand what exactly caffeine is and how it works. To do that, I've called in some help. UGO: My name is Ugo Iroku. I'm a gastroenterologist in New York City and also associate professor at Mount Sinai Hospital, division of gastroenterology. TAGLE: Where is Dr. Ugo on the caffeine obsession scale? UGO: I am not a caffeine lover. I'm a caffeine observer. TAGLE: As a gastroenterologist, Dr. Ugo is often the person who has to tell his patients they need to alter or limit their relationship with caffeine. UGO: It makes me very unpopular and - which is why I always try to be practical. And I don't take it away. I just modify the amount that they intend to incorporate into their baseline going forward. TAGLE: Before we get to baselines and modifications - coffee. Takeaway one - understand what's in your cup. UGO: Yeah, so caffeine is a compound that exists in a number of plants, probably over 60 worldwide. And it also exists in our coffee beans and tea leaves, in kola nuts and cacao. TAGLE: Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant. That means when it's absorbed into the body, it helps stimulate the brain and the central nervous system, essentially speeding up the message between your head and the rest of your body. It does that by blocking something called adenosine. UGO: So this is where you pause the story to say, what is adenosine? And adenosine, interestingly enough, is a byproduct of the energy source in our body. So we run off of an energy source called ATP. TAGLE: That stands for adenosine triphosphate. UGO: And with the continued use of the ATP, adenosine is like a little marker saying, hey, yet another unit of energy has been dispensed. TAGLE: When the neurotransmitter adenosine has sent out enough of those little used energy messages, you get drowsy and your body slows down. So what caffeine does is get in adenosine's way, stopping it from delivering those messages to the adenosine receptors that are waiting for that signal for the body to rest. UGO: And so it creates a situation where we have increased amount of alertness and decreased amount of drowsiness. And so caffeine doesn't give us energy, but it gives us more alertness by blocking adenosine's message to tell us to slow down and to go to sleep. TAGLE: OK, pause here. Product marketing has told us over and over again that caffeine equals energy. But... UGO: That's a myth because caffeine in and of itself does not give you energy. TAGLE: Now, there are plenty of energy-like things that caffeine does for you that I'm sure I don't have to spell out, but will for good measure. It makes you more alert and focused. Some studies have also shown that it can improve mood, cognitive and athletic performance, even potentially increase metabolism. But all of these effects are not the same thing as providing actual energy to your body. Only food can do that. Why is this important to know? Because Dr. Ugo says that far too often, people try to use caffeine as a substitute for adequate rest and nutrition. I know I'm guilty of that. Unfortunately, that's just not how it works. UGO: Caffeine can never make up for a poor night's sleep. The only thing that can make up for a poor night's sleep is more sleep. TAGLE: And that 3 p.m. coffee? It might help you get through your afternoon hump, but it's important to know that that tired feeling will likely boomerang back to you later on in your day. Because remember, caffeine doesn't get rid of those sleepy signals; it just holds them off a while. So caffeine is cool, but you'll still need your fruit, your veggies and your bedtime. And while we're on the topic of diet, there's probably another caffeine reputation you're familiar with. UGO: One effect that some people report is that when they consume coffee, they feel that they have an increased amount of desire to go to the bathroom and to move their bowels. TAGLE: Coffee, specifically, is a common tool for keeping people regular. But some research suggests caffeine in general might help get you moving, too. You might have also heard that caffeine is a diuretic. And that's true, but it's a mild one. UGO: Essentially, caffeine can, in moderate amounts, cause a moderate amount of desire to have a urine output. And so, you know, put roughly, I think 300 milligrams of caffeine might induce about four fluid ounces of urine in general. TAGLE: So you can make of that what you will. Or if you want to know more about hydration, head over to our LIFE KIT episode on the topic. The next thing you need to know about caffeine - like I mentioned at the start, caffeine is usually not the bad guy. Takeaway two - caffeine isn't your enemy. It has a PR problem. You've heard the whispers before. Caffeine stunts your growth, causes heart disease, dehydrates you. Steer clear, say the headlines. But these rumors just don't ring true for the vast majority of us. How did we get here? Pull up a cold brew and let's get into it. Marilyn Cornelis is an associate professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. CORNELIS: I do research in nutrition, genetics and special interest in coffee and caffeine health. TAGLE: Marilyn says caffeine often cozies up with bad actors, and that confuses people. CORNELIS: Consuming a lot of caffeine is often equated with someone who is really stressed out and working hard. And some of those other behaviors are actually more greater risk factors for health. And so it becomes what we call a confounder in some of this research. TAGLE: So caffeine has a serious case of guilt by association. CORNELIS: Someone who's drinking a lot of caffeine might be short on sleep. We know sleep is an important risk factor for a number of diseases. TAGLE: Nicotine is another great example. CORNELIS: Smoking and coffee consumption are highly correlated. What's interesting about smoking is that it induces the enzyme that metabolizes caffeine, and so a smoker will want to consume more coffee in order to get that psychostimulant effect. And we know that smoking is a risk factor for a number of health outcomes and diseases. TAGLE: So the more you smoke, the more you'll want caffeine. Another important thing to note in this arena - not all caffeinated drinks are created equal. Black coffee or green tea offer antioxidants and a slew of other potential benefits, for example. But sugary, syrupy Frappuccinos, sodas, energy drinks... UGO: You have a lot of sugar and a lot of other contents that may not be helpful for you. Of course, we know really depends on what you're taking with your caffeine before the judgment comes in. TAGLE: Caffeine alone doesn't rot your teeth or lead to weight gain, but too much soda in your diet might. Healthy caffeine consumption seems to promote heart health, but pounding those caffeine- and sugar-overloaded energy drinks every day might be a quick recipe for health troubles like insomnia, nervousness or irregular heartbeat. You get the point. Caffeine in general is not a lone bandit out to steal your calm and crib your good health. But there is one more big idea to consider here - the idea of caffeine as an addictive drug. CORNELIS: Currently, the U.S. does not consider caffeine an addictive substance. So your layman person, like, everyday - they might say, oh, I'm a caffeine addict. And, of course, there's always jokes about it. But technically, it's not considered a drug of dependence. TAGLE: Let's break down why that might be. There are a number of different factors that can contribute to an addiction or substance use disorder. Among them, according to the DSM-5 - impaired control, physical dependence, social problems and risky use. An addiction to heroin, for example, can greatly impair your judgment and might lead to neglecting responsibilities at home, work or school. If you're addicted to alcohol, you might feel the need to keep drinking even when it causes relationship problems. This is where caffeine seems to stand apart from other drugs - that aspect of social harm. Now, this isn't to say caffeine can't be abused, but the research seems to show that generally, the stakes are a bit different. UGO: Yes, I think there is no strong, clinically significant, you know, adverse effects of being on caffeine the way there is with other harsher chemicals, like cocaine and heroin or the like. TAGLE: That being said, you can build up a tolerance to caffeine, which isn't the same as an addiction. It just means over time, your body gets used to that daily coffee and can produce more adenosine receptors accordingly. And if you don't have it, you might experience withdrawal symptoms. And then there's misuse, which is, well, what it sounds like - using substances - and, in this case, caffeine - at inappropriate levels or ways that could potentially lead to adverse outcomes. We've all had one cup too many and regretted it. So maybe take a pause here and take a hard look at your daily caffeine routine. Is there any part of this relationship that's harming you? Any part of your routine that just isn't sitting right? It's important to know what healthy caffeine consumption looks like for you and to understand that it will look different for everyone, from the surface level to the cellular. And that brings us to takeaway No. 3 - learn your levels. Have you ever been scolded for your venti matcha latte? Given that judgmental eye when you get up for that second cup of coffee or crack open that early morning energy drink? Been there. And Marilyn has some information that might help. For her post-doctoral work at the Harvard School of Public Health, Marilyn studied the relationships between the human genome and our coffee and caffeine consumption. CORNELIS: We found that genetic variants that were related to increased caffeine metabolism were also related to increased caffeine consumption behavior. So if an individual was genetically predisposed to metabolize caffeine very quickly, we found that they tended to consume more caffeine. TAGLE: Marilyn's research found that our appetite and tolerance for caffeine is written in our genetic code. So I might naturally be more of a one-coffee-a-day person and you might be more of the three-coffee type. Neither is good or bad. CORNELIS: You just respond differently to caffeine. You either have grown accustomed to it and you've become - you can tolerate more caffeine. Our genetics are just different, so that makes you different from someone else. TAGLE: The other cool part about this - Marilyn says that your body often already knows what it needs and will signal that to you. CORNELIS: So you're naturally trying to titrate the levels of intake based on your genetics. Some people get really anxious with too much caffeine, so they naturally cut back and they just tend to know. Any avid coffee drinker, they know when to cut off, what - you know, what's the latest that they can have a cup of coffee before it impacts their sleep. TAGLE: Have you ever been flabbergasted by that friend who goes for coffee at 10 p.m. or get jealous of that coworker that only needs a little bit of tea to power through their workday? Personally, I used to love to take a few big swigs of Monster right before laying down for a nap. Don't at me. You might call it wild. I call it genetics. Now, I want to be clear here. This is not a blank check to take down as much caffeine as you want. But it is good to know the effects of caffeine vary from person to person, which means sensitivities and dependence can vary, too. So how can you find your caffeine consumption sweet spot? As a starting point, the Food and Drug Administration suggests a max of 400 milligrams of caffeine a day for the average person because this is an amount not generally associated with dangerous or negative effects. Beyond that limit, some people might experience side effects, like sleeplessness, upset stomach or feelings of unhappiness. Again, this measure is a starting point, so it doesn't apply to everyone equally. But just so you're aware, let's get a handle on what 400 milligrams actually looks like. Most sources say that's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of coffee. But... UGO: You have to be very careful when you're converting from cups to milligrams because there's a cup and then there's a cup that's a venti that, you know, has, like, four times the amount of caffeine you would expect in it. TAGLE: Moderation is key no matter what you're drinking. UGO: Even if you're taking your caffeine in with, you know, a nice, innocent, you know, civilized cup of Earl Grey but you're doing six cups of it, you're consuming a lot more than you would be in terms of caffeine than you would be with a single Monster drink. TAGLE: From there, keep listening to your body. Having a stressful day, so you ask for an extra espresso shot? UGO: Your body can give you feedback - you know, jitteriness, anxiety, you know, a raised pulse - that you're just consuming too much in a given moment. TAGLE: And what about that 4 p.m. energy drink? Will it mess with your sleep? According to the FDA, the half-life of caffeine is between four and six hours. So, yes, if you reach for that can too late, you might be affecting the quality of your rest. UGO: Likely increasing the risk of insomnia and decreasing your REM sleep. TAGLE: Keep track of your patterns over time, too. Does that medium roast just not give you the same kick that it used to do? You need more and more caffeine to do the same functions? UGO: Then that's a warning sign that you might be, quote-unquote, you know, \"relying\" too heavily on caffeine to function. TAGLE: Withdrawal symptoms obviously are another warning sign, and that can look like a lot of things - headaches, fogginess, bad moods or irritability, fatigue, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating - all things we want to avoid on a regular basis, no? And finally, a reminder here, if you have any questions or doubts about your consumption level... UGO: It's worth a conversation with your doctor as to how to best manage your caffeine intake. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK. You've made it this far, and you've decided maybe it's time to make some changes. We've got you covered. Our final takeaway, takeaway four - if you want to cut back, go slow and make swaps. Maybe you're tired of that energy drink calling your name from the vending machine at the start of every workday. Maybe you don't like being so dependent on iced coffee to get through a day of running errands. Or maybe it's just time to change up your routine. How should you do it? Quitting caffeine cold turkey is an option. And Dr. Ugo says the worst of withdrawal symptoms usually abate in around 10 days. But... UGO: Just empirically, we see that half people tend to fail when they try to do it cold turkey. TAGLE: Big yikes. UGO: And so I think ultimately the only benefit is that you get to your goal sooner if you can tough through the withdrawal symptoms. But otherwise a slower, more tapered approach is probably the more humane way to go. CORNELIS: Just do it slowly. It's a lot easier. TAGLE: In most cases, there's no need to make life harder than it needs to be by quitting caffeine full stop. But what does a slow approach to cutting back actually look like? UGO: Johns Hopkins University tried to answer just that question, and they had their patients do a tapered step-down in the amount of caffeine that they consumed. TAGLE: Let's say you normally drink four cups of coffee a day. On Week 1... UGO: They'd have you do three cups of coffee a day. Week 2, you had to cut that down to two cups of coffee a day. TAGLE: One cup of coffee for Week 3 - so far you've cut back one cup of coffee per week. UGO: Week 4 - believe it or not, it would be half a cup of coffee a day. And by the fifth week they wanted you to be down to less than 50 milligrams of caffeine a day, which ultimately ends up to being about a third or so, more or less, of a cup of coffee and without using more than 15 milligrams at any one moment of time. TAGLE: I know what you're thinking. A third of a cup of coffee or less? Don't worry. This is just one way to do it. You know best what an optimal level of caffeine is for you. And something else to remember here - our relationships with caffeine aren't just about what it does to us physiologically. Coffee dates with coworkers, tea with grandma, coke and popcorn at the movies - caffeine is such a big part of our personal and social rituals. These things are significant. UGO: Maybe the whole ritual involved in obtaining our caffeine does give us a dopamine hit. TAGLE: So see where you can make some swaps. Maybe you just need a fizzy drink at the movies, not a soda necessarily, and could opt for sparkling water instead of Pepsi. Maybe what you're craving in the middle of that stressful workday isn't that Americano with an extra shot, but the fresh air and the breaking your day that the walk to the coffee shop affords you. Have a weekly coffee date with your bestie? Just swap for decaf. UGO: And so you can very quickly achieve a drop in your caffeine intake while still getting some of the other social and kind of psychological cues with having your drink. TAGLE: Whether you're looking for a good time with friends, a way to make that work deadline or a good study buddy for that big exam, remember, you have options. UGO: So I think as a society, it's almost like a contract. We understand that we're using this. We benefit from it. And everyone personally has an individual responsibility to make sure that they're using it properly. TAGLE: Don't be scared to change or experiment with your relationship with caffeine. The important thing is that caffeine should be a helpful friend in your corner, not the boss of you. All right. I've had a gulp of green tea, and I'm ready to close this out. Let's recap. Takeaway 1 - understand what's in your cup. Caffeine can do a lot for you, but it's not an energy source. Sorry, friends. The only fix for a lack of sleep is more sleep. Takeaway 2 - caffeine is not the enemy. There are so many benefits to adding caffeine to your diet. Don't be scared by old wives' tales. Takeaway 3 - learn your levels. Caffeine consumption is not one-size-fits-all. We all have different sensitivities and tendencies, so listen to your body. Takeaway 4 - if it's time to cut back, go slow, and remember you can still savor your rituals. For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes. I hosted one on combating diet culture.

A hurricane warning was in effect for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Holguin and Las Tunas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Early Wednesday, Melissa had top sustained winds of 120 mph (193 kph) and was moving northeast at 10 mph (16 kph) according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Chivirico and about 60 miles (97 kilometers) west-southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba. Melissa was forecast to cross the island through the morning and move into the Bahamas later Wednesday. The continuing intense rain could cause life-threatening flooding with numerous landslides, U.S. forecasters said. A hurricane watch was in effect for Bermuda. Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday with top sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph). The storm was expected to generate a storm surge of up to 12 feet (3.6 meters) in the region and drop up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain in parts of eastern Cuba. \"Numerous landslides are likely in those areas,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which already has led to prolonged power blackouts, fuel shortages and food shortages. \"There will be a lot of work to do. We know there will be a lot of damage,\" Díaz-Canel said in a televised address, in which he assured that \"no one is left behind and no resources are spared to protect the lives of the population.\" At the same time, he urged the population not to underestimate the power of Melissa, \"the strongest ever to hit national territory.\" Provinces from Guantánamo — in the far east — to Camagüey, almost in the center of elongated Cuba, had already suspended classes on Monday. As Cuba prepared for the storm, officials in Jamaica prepared to fan out Wednesday to assess the damage. Extensive damage was reported in parts of Clarendon in southern Jamaica and in the southwestern parish of St. Elizabeth, which was \"under water,\" said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. The storm also damaged four hospitals and left one without power, forcing officials to evacuate 75 patients, McKenzie said. More than half a million customers were without power as of late Tuesday as officials reported that most of the island experienced downed trees, power lines and extensive flooding. The government said it hopes to reopen all of Jamaica's airports as early as Thursday to ensure the quick distribution of emergency relief supplies. The storm already was blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1122660697","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"U.S. Immigration Reform and Human Rights: A Growing Tension","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is undergoing a significant transformation in its immigration policies, aiming to balance national security with humanitarian obligations.

It can lead us to believe that we can confidently sing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" at karaoke even though we haven't heard the song in years, or that one terrible review on Yelp is reason enough not to go to a 4-star rated restaurant.  These thinking errors are what people in the psychology community call cognitive biases. And that's the focus of a new book out this month,  Thinking 101: How to Reason Better to Live Better , by Yale psychology professor  Woo-kyoung Ahn . In the book, Ahn highlights some of the most pernicious cognitive slip-ups we make — and how biases can cloud our judgment and affect the people around us. Researchers suspect that many of these biases are evolutionary, says Ahn. During times of scarcity, our ancestors had to make quick judgments in order to survive among predators or thrive in a difficult environment. But in a time of abundance, she adds, these quick judgments don't always do us good.  However, we can do our best to try to correct these thinking traps, says Ahn, which she teaches her students how to do in her popular undergraduate course at Yale. In general, she says, the key is to pause before making assumptions — and be aware of our tendencies for different kinds of bias.  Ahn talks to Life Kit about three common cognitive biases and how to counteract them.  The bias: We overestimate our abilities  \n       \n      Related Story:  Understanding Unconscious Bias \n       This is known in the field of psychology as an \"illusion of fluency,\" which describes our tendency to be overconfident in our abilities without sufficient evidence. This can lead us, for example, to bungle career-altering presentations because of inadequate preparation, or dramatically underestimate the time it takes to complete projects.   In her class at Yale, Ahn uses an experiment to illustrate this phenomenon with her students. She shows them a dance clip from the song  \"Boy with Luv\" by the K-pop group BTS . After watching six seconds of the easiest choreography moves over and over again, she invites the students who believe they have the dance down to do it themselves. One after another stumbles. \"People can have overconfidence about what they can accomplish by watching other people do it so fluently,\" Ahn says. When the pros dance in a way that looks effortless, they think they can do it effortlessly too.  How to counteract it:  You can correct this bias, she says, by doing what the Yale students did: Try it out yourself. It will quickly put any feelings of overconfidence to rest.  You can also fight this tendency by over-preparing and considering potential obstacles beforehand, says Ahn. For example, if you're working on a home remodeling project for the first time and have no idea how long it will take, don't try to guess. Talk to friends who went through a recent remodel or consult with a few contractors to understand how long the project might take and what problems may arise. The more information you have, the better and more accurately you can assess a situation.  The bias: We tend to fixate on the negative  The concept of \"negativity bias\" illustrates our propensity to weigh negative events a lot more heavily than an equal amount of positive events. It explains why a friend's unenthusiastic review of an Oscar-nominated movie, for example, might spur you to watch something else. Or why you might be less inclined to hire a potential employee after hearing one negative thing about them, despite positive referrals. Negativity bias can be dangerous because it can lead us to make the wrong choices. It can hold us back from making a decision about something, say a big purchase like a house, or even a political candidate, out of fear there was once a negative event associated with an otherwise good choice.  How to counteract it:  When making a choice, play up the positive attributes of your options, says Ahn. Marketers use this tactic all the time. For example, instead of saying that ground beef contains 11% fat, they label it is as 89% lean. These are both true and accurate descriptions of the same product, but flipping the framing of it can make it a more attractive choice for buyers concerned with fat intake.  The bias: We cherry-pick data to fit our worldview Ahn considers \"confirmation bias\" — the tendency to seek out or interpret information to support what we already believe — the worst bias of all. That's because of its potential to lead us to miss an entire range of possibilities for ourselves and others.  Ahn and Matthew Lebowitz, a psychology professor at Columbia University,  conducted an experiment  in 2017 to illustrate the pitfalls of this bias. They gathered a group of participants and told some of them they had a genetic predisposition to depression – even though they did not. The results of that group's depression self-assessments showed much higher levels of depression than people in a control group who were told they did not have the predisposition.  Because of confirmation bias, the participants who were told they had a genetic risk of depression retrieved \"only the evidence that fit with that hypothesis,\" says Ahn. And in doing so, they managed to convince themselves that they were  actually  depressed. The study shows that if we  believe  something is a fact, even if it isn't, our mind can find information to support those views.  Now imagine this bias at work on a societal level. Ahn says it can lead to under- or over-representation in say, leadership in politics, business and other industries, which can feed gender or racial inequality.  She shares an example. Let's say you're a male scientist and you're looking to hire other scientists to join your company. Because you see that the most prominent scientists in your field are currently men, you've convinced yourself that the next generation of great scientists will  also  be men. This colors your decision-making in hiring — and so you fill the positions with men.  That choice will continue to have a ripple effect, says Ahn. For others looking at the new hires, it might perpetuate the idea that \"only men can be great scientists — and that's exactly how prejudice and stereotypes get formed in society.\" How to counteract it:  Allow yourself to examine all possible explanations before you make a judgment. For example, if an actor landed a part but her parents were also in the entertainment business, many of us might attribute her employment to nepotism. Since we've seen many examples of parents giving their kids a leg up in business or politics, another example of a child benefiting from their parents' success would fit that theory.  But could it also be true that she gave the best audition? By looking at the issue from many different viewpoints – not just your own – it challenges your confirmation bias. And you might realize that perhaps there is another side to the story.  The audio portion of this episode was produced by Michelle Aslam. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

Most of us have probably never taken a class that's just about thinking or, more specifically, thinking traps. But Woo-kyoung Ahn teaches on these in her role as a psychology professor at Yale. Her class focuses on the common cognitive biases we fall into, sometimes without realizing them. She likes to start out one of her lectures by showing them a BTS dance clip. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WOO-KYOUNG AHN: All right. What I'm going to do is I will play the original version first, OK? And then we'll get to the slowed down version, OK? See whether you can do it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BOY WITH LUV\") BTS: (Singing in non-English language). HU: So her students watch this short clip over and over again, trying to remember all the basic steps. AHN: The one that I use is supposed to be the easiest one. And I only got, like, six seconds of that video. And I played that, like, 10 times to the students. And I warn them that they can come out and show the dance for the whole class, and there will be a prize for it. You feel like you can do it. I even - I feel like I could do it. I'm not a dancer at all. But after that, they come out and don't look at the screen anymore. I only play the music. They face the audience. And then, of course, none of them could do it. HU: The experiment with her students illustrates the fluency effect, one of the many cognitive traps Woo-kyoung Ahn warns us about. AHN: It's about almost everything that looks, like, very fluent and executed skillfully. We - it creates an illusion that it's easy to do. HU: Of course, it's not just about fooling ourselves into thinking we're better dancers than we actually are. Our cognitive biases can seriously cloud our judgment and sometimes lead to bigger societal issues, like thinking hydrochloroquine (ph) is a COVID cure, for example. So one question I have is, does knowing about these biases and the tendencies that we have to fall into these errors do anything to prevent them? AHN: Well, I don't think that's sufficient solution. But it is actually a necessary step, right? HU: So awareness is a first step? AHN: Yes, exactly. We should be aware of it. But I don't think it's a magic wand, of course not. AHN: OK. Step one - learn your biases. On this episode of LIFE KIT - Thinking 101. Professor Ahn walks us through some common thinking traps she writes about in her new book and offers helpful advice on how to avoid them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HU: Let's get into some of the biases that really have major consequences - not only for us individually, but also as a society. There are two particular thinking traps that I want to focus on because they could have severe effects. The first is negativity bias, which you write makes us act totally irrationally sometimes or just leads us to make the wrong choices. So what is it? And give me an example. AHN: So the negative bias is the loss. The negative information actually weighs a lot more than the equal amount of positive information. HU: OK. So give me an example in my daily life. I remember you had one about kind of when we are shopping and looking at ratings. AHN: Right. Right. It's called - it's like a loss aversion, too. So let's say you order something online, and it said free return. No risk at all, so you just order it. You're not sure about the length or the fit. It arrived, and now you try it on. It kind of belongs to your house. It's kind of yours. And you can't return it just because it is yours now. You own it at this point. Returning would mean losing it, and that feels like a huge, huge, you know, effect to you. HU: Why is it that we cling to things that we already have and are kind of scared to lose them? AHN: So some people make an evolutionary argument about this. They say we were evolved to be a lot more sensitive to the negativity than positivity because our ancestors lived in a environment where resources are very scarce. It's just a matter of life or death... HU: OK. Yeah. AHN: ...All the time. So losing something at that point should mean a lot of - you know, it should be something that we should care a lot about. Gaining something, it's kind of a luxury at that point. Right? So that's why we are a lot sensitive to losses. So it does make sense. But in this - in the current environment, that can't be the case for most of the people. HU: So because we tend to have loss aversion and filter for the negative, how do we counteract that? AHN: I try reframing the questions. So there's a study. It involves a custody decision between two parents. Parent A has - it's, like, a parent with all B grades, just average on everything. Parent B has very good features and very bad features. And if we ask participants, who would you offer the custody to, then they choose the second one because they focus only on the good features. And then if a different group of subjects were asked who would deny the custody from, then they'd also choose the second one because they focus on the negative ones. So one of the ways of avoiding the negativity bias would be to reframe your question. Instead of just saying, who would you deny the custody, maybe you might want to reframe it as who would you give the custody to, then kind of average out. So it's like ground beef, right? You - we can say that it's a 15% pure fat. But it's 85 - it's a 85% lean, right? So that's one way of getting over it. HU: Yeah, so when I'm shopping and I see 85% lean, I'm like, oh, that's good enough. That's lean enough. But you're saying that if it was advertised as 10% pure fat or 15% pure fat, that really reframes things. AHN: Exactly. Yeah. Yep. HU: The next big bias or thinking trap I want to focus on is confirmation bias. And this came up a lot, obviously - during election years, especially. You argue that confirmation bias is probably the worst of all the biases. What is it really quick? AHN: So there are two kinds of confirmation bias. One is that it's a tendency to seek evidence that would confirm your hypothesis. The other is a tendency to interpret evidence to fit with what you believe. So I - so they're just - you know, it's the same kind of bias, right? It's trying to show you're right. So it's at two levels. One is you want to be fair to yourself. So here's one study that I did. I gave participants some fake genetic information about themselves. This is all RB-approved. It's ethically conducted. So they perform some saliva test. And they were asked to rinse their mouth with a mouthwash, and that mouthwash actually contained a large amount of sugar. And then they have to put this test strip under their tongue, and the color changes because that test strip is just diabetes stripe. And when the color changes, we randomly assign them into one of the two conditions. In one condition, we tell them that means that you don't have genetic risks for major depression. In the other, that says the color change means that you have elevated levels of genetic risks for depression. You know, there were, like, more than hundreds of participants. There's no reason why one group would be particularly more depressed than the other group. And then I administered Beck's Depression Inventory, which is a measure of depression. HU: Sure. AHN: And we asked them how depressed they were in the past two weeks or how pessimistic they were, how they how well they slept and so on. And then the people - the group who were told that they don't have genetic risks - they were way below the cutoff for the depression. But the people who received the positive test results, they were way higher than the cutoff for the major depression. That is - this three-minute fake saliva test... HU: Made them think... AHN: ...Created... HU: Made them depressed... AHN: ...Created a major depression. Yes. Exactly. That's what I mean by how confirmation bias can be unfair to you because once you learn that you have a genetic risk for depression and when you think about your past two weeks, you may retrieve only the evidence that fits with that hypothesis. HU: Yeah. So you're shortchanging yourself. AHN: Exactly. Exactly. And once you start believing that, then moving on - I mean, of course, we had to debrief them right away, so - that this is all fake and - yeah, blah, blah, blah. But moving - if they were not - in real life, if they actually get that kind of a genetic feedback, they might move on - they might go on thinking that I am actually a depressed person. HU: I can see how, you know, a teacher telling me in elementary school that I wasn't good at sports then made me filter and make me shortchange myself - right? - and think that, oh, gosh, I'm never going to be an athlete. Right? Or - this can happen in a bunch of different permutations. AHN: Exactly. Exactly. So that is what I mean by how the confirmation bias can be unfair at the individual level. HU: And how could better thinking be fairer at a more collective level? AHN: Right. So if you hire, for instance, only the male people for top-level scientist jobs, you know, people believe that only men can be great scientists. Only men have a - they have a better, you know, intrinsic aptitude to do science. Then you don't end up hiring female scientists. And that's exactly how the prejudice and stereotype gets formed in the society. But look who discovered all these COVID vaccines - female scientists. But there's no guarantee we should be open minded that there can be other possible causes. HU: So what would you say that we should remind ourselves when trying to explain the why of something, or when we make quick judgments or decisions? What could we do to counteract some of the most common traps? HU: For the confirmation bias, you should always think about what the other possible counterfactual case is, right? Always think about - yeah. What if - would it have been the case if the person was also a female and so on? I mean, confirmation bias is really difficult one to get rid of because it is actually very adaptive mechanism, too. So for instance, when your - when we were - our ancestors were hunters and gatherers. They go to forest and found very good berries. And would you try a different forest to find - to try to falsify your hypothesis, or would you go back to the same hypothesis - the same forest, right? You know, it's a confirmation bias, but it's actually also adaptive system. What is interesting about confirmation bias that's described in the popular media is that they feel like it's something devious, something that, you know, only very bad people want to do it just to prove that they are right. No, that's not the case. It's just ingrained in our cognitive system. It's a very - yeah. It's a very efficient system, right? Because we're not born to be scientists. We don't need to find out the truth about everything. HU: And medically, I don't want to try and take all the drugs in order to figure out which one which one works for me. AHN: Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, my husband, he had worked with - you know, in my life for 27 years. I'm not going to try another husband to falsify the possibility. HU: Very costly. AHN: Yes. Yes. But in other cases, however, it can go wrong. Right? Like, you know, you might also limit the possibilities in your life. For instance, you might go to the restaurant and... HU: Same thing... AHN: ...Eat still the same food. Yeah - same thing over and over again. So for the things that are not as risky, you might want to just kind of do the random search just for fun. So you can just take a different route to go to your work. Why not, right? HU: Before we let you go, Woo-kyoung, are there any basic questions that we could ask ourselves if we feel like, hey, I might be falling into a cognitive trap and I want to counteract it? AHN: One of the things that I sometimes do when I get overly anxious or overly stressed out, I just, you know, take the drawing perspective. I pretend that I'm watching myself from a drawing. And it really kind of puts me in - puts everything into perspective. I kind of see, oh yeah, there's the other side of the story, too. Or this is actually nothing, you know. What I'm worried about is really nothing compared to everything else. Or we could also think about the alternative scenarios as well. In many cases that helps with, you know, overly narrow judgments and being overly confident about your judgments, because if you broaden your perspectives, then yes, you realize that, oh yeah, maybe there is a different story side of the story as well. Yeah. HU: And for the bias that we think that we might be good at an easy BTS move, how do we counteract that? AHN: You have to just try it. You have to dance it. That's easy. That's the easiest one to start out with. Do it. HU: Woo-kyoung Ahn, a professor at Yale University and the author of \"Thinking 101,\" which is available now. Thanks so much, professor.

6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In April, the future was looking bleak for an experimental Alzheimer's drug called valiltramiprosate, or ALZ-801. Researchers had just released  topline results  of a study of more than 300 people age 50 or older, who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's. Overall, those who got the drug did no better than those given a placebo. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But in September, a  closer look  at the results revealed benefits for a subgroup of 125 people who had only mild memory problems when they started taking the drug.  Those participants, initially diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment rather than mild dementia, \"showed very meaningful responses,\" says Dr. Susan Abushakra, chief medical officer of Alzheon, the drug's maker. By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. That result appears comparable with benefits from the two Alzheimer's drugs now on the market:  lecanemab  and  donabemab . But the true effect of ALZ-801 is hard to quantify because of the relatively small number of participants in the group with mild cognitive impairment. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       More robust results came from measures of brain atrophy — the shrinkage that tends to come with Alzheimer's. In the hippocampus, for example, participants who got ALZ-801 experienced about 18% less atrophy than those who got a placebo. That's an important difference, Abushakra says, because the hippocampus is critical to memory and thinking. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The findings were published in the journal  Drugs . The study was supported by a $47 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. A drug that's different Ordinarily, results like that would probably fall short of the evidence required for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. But ALZ-801 may get special consideration because it has potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market. Those drugs are both monoclonal antibodies given by intravenous infusions. That adds to the cost and requires patients to make multiple trips to an infusion center. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       ALZ-801 is a twice-daily pill that can be taken at home. Also, the monoclonal antibodies work primarily by breaking down sticky amyloid plaques. These plaques form after fragments of a misfolded protein called beta-amyloid begin to clump together. Alzheon's product is meant to keep plaques from forming in the first place, by preventing amyloid proteins from clumping at all. As a result, ALZ-801 doesn't cause the swelling or bleeding in the brain that often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment. A safer treatment for a high-risk group The availability of a safer drug like ALZ-801 could be a boon to people who carry two copies of a gene called APOE4. Their genetic status means they have about 10 times the usual risk of developing Alzheimer's. As a result, even though APOE4/4 carriers make up only about 2% of the population, they represent about 15% of all people diagnosed with the disease. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Unfortunately, people with APOE4 genes are not only more vulnerable to Alzheimer's, they are also more likely to experience side effects from treatment with monoclonal antibodies. \"These individuals are at higher risk for inflammation in the brain that can be quite serious,\" says  Jessica Langbaum , an Alzheimer's researcher at Banner Health in Phoenix. Even so, Langbaum thinks people with the APOE4/4 genes can be treated safely with the current monoclonal antibodies. That could mean starting with a lower dose, she says, or beginning treatment earlier in the disease, when fewer amyloid plaques are present. But  David Watson , a scientist who carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, thinks people like him need a safer drug. Watson, a co-author of the new study, also notes that ALZ may have benefits beyond those seen with monoclonal antibodies. For example, he says, the experimental drug appears better at reducing levels of a protein fragment associated with brain cell death. \"We're really making a difference in keeping neurons alive,\" he says. More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is coming from people who have kept taking ALZ-801 after the initial 18-month study period ended, Watson says. Despite carrying genes that usually lead to a swift decline, he says, \"many of them are holding their own\" in their 60s and 70s. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587603","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Families Could Start Losing Access to Head Start if Shutdown Continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, over 65,000 children across the nation, especially in states like Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Ohio, face losing access to Head Start—the federal early learning program for low-income families.

 Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Beginning Nov. 1, more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. The leaders of 134 local Head Start programs, as well as another half-dozen whose funding lapsed on Oct. 1, are now debating how long they can go before closing their doors, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"They are scrambling,\" Sheridan says. \"There is a ton of hard work, a ton of goodwill, a ton of dedication – but hard work, goodwill and dedication don't keep your doors open, unfortunately.\" Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. As such, Sheridan says, if the shutdown lasts until December, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. Head Start closures could hit Florida's migrant farm workers Daniel Jaime manages six Head Start centers across three Florida counties as part of the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project – a nonprofit that serves the children of migrant and seasonal farmworkers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's a pretty hard deadline,\" Jaime says of Nov. 1, when his centers will have to close unless their funding is somehow extended. \"We're all hoping for a miracle that things change.\" Jaime was born in Florida and attended Head Start as the child of a farmworker. He later sent his own children to Head Start as a farmworker himself. Right now, he says, fall peppers and cucumbers need picking, with tomatoes due next month and strawberries soon after. If he can't provide Head Start care to the children of the workers that growers rely on to harvest these crops, he worries, markets and ultimately consumers could feel the blow. In the short term, Jaime also worries that some workers may have no choice but to leave their children in less-than-ideal settings to keep working – like with an adult in the community who's informally looking after many of the children who would otherwise be in Head Start. \"That's a big thing for me right now, is knowing that we have our babies out there, and we can't serve them,\" he says. How some centers will manage to stay open   While some programs may be forced to close after Friday, others have cobbled together plans to stay open at least a little longer. \"We have determined that we can continue services through Nov. 14,\" says Corey Holcomb, who runs a Head Start program serving more than 250 children across Michigan's Upper Peninsula. \"After that, if the shutdown is still going on, we would have to close.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Holcomb says she has been exploring funding options since the beginning of October. That includes weighing taking out a loan, something her agency and board of directors decided was \"not a viable option.\" Her plan now is to lean on reserve funds while also temporarily cutting expenses. \"We've asked for deferments on rent payments and some utility bills,\" Holcomb says. The programs that may be best positioned to stay open, even without federal funding, are in the roughly  14 states  that also provide  state  dollars to support Head Start, including Oregon. \"I have hope,\" says Suey Linzmeier, executive director of Head Start of Yamhill County in northern Oregon. Her program serves 314 children or, as she puts it: \"314 more opportunities to change a life for the better.\" While many Head Start programs receive little state financial support, Linzmeier says roughly 60% of her program's funding comes from Oregon. Without those dollars, she would likely have to close their doors on Nov. 1. \"I don't even know what we would do\" she says. Head Start celebrated its  60th anniversary  this year. And while it has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, the Trump administration  reportedly weighed cutting the program  from its budget proposal and, earlier this year,  temporarily withheld Head Start funding . Holcomb in Michigan says a staff member recently told her, \"If somebody in Congress could just come and spend one hour in our classroom and see the work that we're doing and how important it is…\" Her voice trails off. \"Our children need us.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-91330","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"8 Low-Effort Ways to Make Spooky Season Feel Cozy and Festive","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article offers low-effort, mindful ways to make the spooky season feel cozy and festive, including switching to warm beverages, minimizing fall decor, embracing nature walks as a form of emotional reflection, and simplifying Halloween costumes or events.

But if you're feeling anxious about making the most of it, why not take a simpler, more mindful approach? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We've rounded up a few low-effort ways to make the lead-up to Halloween feel cozy and festive, whether that's becoming a pro at reheating frozen soup, creating a small ritual to mark the season (like switching from iced coffee to hot coffee), or giving yourself permission to go minimal with the fall decor this year. 🌡️Make simple adjustments to your lifestyle as the season changes .  \"Prepare your nest\" as the days shorten and the weather cools, says Kari Leibowitz, author of  How to Winter: Harness Your Mindset to Thrive on Cold, Dark, or Difficult Days . \"Light candles. Switch from a cold breakfast to a warm breakfast. Switch from iced coffee to hot coffee.\" 🎃  When decorating for the season, consider how much effort you want to put into cleaning up   — like taking down all those cobwebs, bats and jack-o'-lantern garlands. \"What goes up must go down,\" says interior designer Elaine Griffin, author of  Design Rules: The Insider's Guide to Becoming Your Own Decorator . So \"think about your level of commitment to\" putting away that decor. 🍁 On your next forest walk, take a moment to observe the natural cycle of life .  In many cultures, fall is a symbol of death and rebirth. Plants shed their leaves and prepare for winter dormancy, giving way to new life. Use your next nature walk as a way to reflect on the natural order of things. This is a particularly cathartic practice if you are grieving, says Gary Evans, director of the  Forest Bathing Institute , 🍎  Don't feel like you have to find the perfect Halloween costume.  It can be a lot of pressure to come up with a clever pop culture reference or decide on the movie character who you most admire. Why not try something fun, unexpected and irreverent instead? Be an inanimate object, like an apple or a baked potato, or heck, even \"a bottle of Windex,\" says Los Angeles-based stylist  Sophie Strauss . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       🎬 Find little tweaks to level up your home theater .  Fall is a time for  spooky movies  and comfort TV shows.  Devika Girish , editor of  Film Comment  Magazine, explains what you'll need to mimic the immersive experience of a movie theater at home. Watch the film on the biggest screen available to you (if you can, get a projector). Get some blankets. And fix yourself some snacks. Girish particularly loves munching on crisped chickpeas and popcorn and sipping a hot cup of cider while watching movies. 🍲 Make your leftovers go further and reheat frozen soup like a pro . Author and chef  Sohla El-Waylly  shares her advice: \"Throw the frozen soup into a pot with a splash of water to get a little steam going at the bottom. Go for a low heat at first to get everything melted, then once it's melted, bring it up to a boil,\" she says. \"Then give it a taste and see if you need to re-season it with salt. Oftentimes, it can fall a little flat, and you might need a squeeze of lemon to brighten everything up.\" 🥧 If making pastry dough for an autumnal pie feels too difficult, try making a tart.   \"It's not as time-intensive or technical as a pie,\" says Lauren Ko, a baker and the author of  Pieometry . And many can be made without pastry dough. \"Blend up some speculoos cookies with some melted butter and you have a shell. Or toast up coconut and pecans and add butter for another shell.\" 🚫 Opt out of a Halloween party or two — then let go of that feeling of FOMO . When you find yourself thinking the leaves are more colorful on the other side, remind yourself that the ones in front of you are pretty great too. \"Maybe [you chose to stay in] because you had a long week and you need to recharge with some alone time. Or maybe you have an early start the next day. Whatever the reason might be, it's important to remember that as humans, we live by making a series of trade-offs,\" says  Aarti Gupta , clinical director at TherapyNest in Palo Alto, Calif.

Originating in the late 1990s with Kassiane Asasumasu, the term was initially used in online autism communities as a more inclusive alternative to the narrower concept of 'neurodiversity,' which had become associated primarily with autism. Over time, the term gained widespread popularity during the 2010s and especially during the pandemic, when increased public discourse on mental health and accessibility led to greater awareness and acceptance. The article highlights that neurodivergence encompasses a broad range of conditions—including autism, ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s, and even acquired conditions like long COVID or traumatic brain injury—and that intentional neurodivergence can result from practices like meditation or psychedelic use. While the term has become more mainstream, concerns exist about its narrowing use as a synonym for autism, reducing inclusivity. Newer terms like 'neurospicy' are emerging, particularly among people of color, reflecting cultural diversity in how neurodivergence is understood and expressed. The article also notes regional differences in cultural perceptions of neurodivergent behaviors, emphasizing that context matters. Overall, 'neurodivergent' is a dynamic, evolving concept that reflects both scientific understanding and social activism in recognizing and valuing diverse minds.","keyTakeAways":["The term

How 'neurodivergent' became a word for many types of minds \n         By Ayana Archie \n        \n           Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Our minds work in different ways. Despite all the research into our brains, a lot has yet to be discovered. But in recent years, many people  have championed a way to describe some of what we do know.  And that way is through the term \"neurodivergent,\" which took off on Google trends amid widespread coronavirus lockdowns in June 2020.  Since the pandemic, \"neurodivergent\" has made waves online, in the media and in academic studies to help talk about neurological differences more inclusively. The term really got its start back in the late 1990s, and was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2002. In 2019, the Oxford English Dictionary added it as well.. So for the latest  \"Word of the Week,\"  we're talking about being \"neurodivergent.\" What does neurodivergent mean? Neurodivergent is an umbrella term that describes people whose way of processing information is different from what society considers normal, according to Nick Walker, a psychology professor at the California Institute of Integral Studies. \"Brains differ from each other in the way fingerprints do. 'Neurodivergence' establishes this idea that within the spectrum of neurodiversity, there are dominant norms and divergences from those dominant norms,\" he said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There is a widespread belief that \"neurodivergent\" is a medical term, limited to diagnoses such as autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. \"It super is not,\" said neurodivergence activist Kassiane Asasumasu, who is credited with coming up with the word.  And there are different ways people become neurodivergent, said Walker. Some are born that way. Others develop neurodivergences because of things like traumatic head injuries or long COVID. And intentional neurodivergence can happen, for example, in people who meditate frequently or use psychedelics, Walker said.  Where the word comes from In the late '90s, Asasumasu was a high school student, active on online forums for people with autism. \"Neurodiversity\" had been coined a few years earlier  by autistic civil rights activists.  People often confuse neurodivergence and neurodiversity, but there is an important difference, Walker said. \"The spectrum of human neurodiversity includes everybody ever, including people who are within the dominant norms,\" he said. \"With neurodivergence, you diverge from something. You differ in some way from some socially constructed norm.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But \"neurodiversity\" began being used as a synonym for autism, and everyone else was deemed neurotypical. Asasumasu said while \"neurodiversity\" was progressive, it wasn't enough.  \"You've got typical, and what's the opposite of typical?\" she said.  She began using neurodivergent first online, where she had the term in her AOL signature, and it became especially popular within online communities for autistic people. Then it spread to her school, where her peers were using it in face-to-face conversations.  Asasumasu, now a board member for the nonprofit Foundations for Divergent Minds, said she felt the need for a more general term. For one, some people have multiple neurodivergences. The term \"neurodivergence\" offers people who have them a way to express their differences without revealing their medical history or other private details, she said. It's also a way for people with neurodivergences to band together and leverage social and political power. \"It's just good to have solidarity across disability,\" Asasumasu said.  How it became popular \"Neurodivergent\" gained widespread traction within the neurodivergent community in the 2010s, said Morénike Giwa Onaiwu, a researcher on neurodivergence and founder of the nonprofit Advocacy Without Borders. Walker remembers being taken aback when around 2010 or 2011, a student of his said they were neurodivergent while introducing themselves to the class. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"That was the moment where I was like, 'Oh, this is taking off somehow,'\" he said. Then in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic helped thrust the term into news articles and casual conversation. Isolation and the onset of remote work led to public discussions about accessibility accommodations and mental health, Onaiwu said. \"These were a lot of the accommodations that [neurodivergent people] had been begging for, and advocating for, that we were always told were not possible,\" she said. \"But when the rest of the world needed it, it was something that was possible.\" However, Asasumasu said the word has started to become less inclusive as it becomes more popular.  Like \"neurodiversity\" in the '90s, people tend to now use \"neurodivergent\" as a synonym for autism, leaving out divergences like depression, Alzheimer's, bipolar disorder,  and more. \"It is a very, very large tent,\" she said. \"However big you think it is, it is bigger than that.\" In other ways, \"neurodivergent\" continues to expand. \"Neurospicy\" has emerged as a synonym, which Onaiwu said she first saw being used by people of color drawing inspiration from their various cultural cuisines. \"Neurodivergent\" is also becoming popular in other English-speaking countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, Walker said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Onaiwu said her academic works have been translated into other languages, but notes that what is considered neurodivergent in some places may not be the same in others. For example, avoiding eye contact can be common in some places, and therefore might not be seen as a sign of neurodivergence as it could in the U.S. Some cultures may be more accepting and don't feel the need to label neurodivergences, while they may be heavily stigmatized in others. As people continue to learn about the experiences of those with neurodivergences, Onaiwu encourages them to stay grounded in shared humanity. \"They matter just by virtue of being human,\" she said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-7053","dateOfPublication":"2024-07-02","timeOfPublication":"09:10:00-04:00","title":"Dining out with a big group?

Learn the social etiquette of splitting the check \n         By Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Tuesday, July 2, 2024 • 9:10 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Let's say you're at a restaurant with a group of friends. You ordered appetizers, maybe got a bottle of wine for the table, went all in for dessert ... then the bill arrives.  No one is offering to cover the whole tab. So how do you handle the check? Do you split it evenly among everyone at the table? What if you only got a salad while your buddy got the surf and turf special? Splitting the bill is  a fine art . Whether you're eating family-style at a Korean barbecue joint or having a three-course meal at a fancy restaurant, there should be \"a sense of equality in how the check is divvied up\" when the meal ends, says  Kiki Aranita , a food editor at  New York Magazine  and the former co-chef and owner of Poi Dog, a Hawaiian restaurant in Philadelphia.  She goes over common scenarios you may encounter while dining out with a large group — and how to dial down the awkwardness by keeping things fair and square.  Scenario 1: I arrived to dinner late. Everyone at the table already ordered drinks and appetizers and are about to order their entrees. What should I do?  When you're ready to order, tell your server you want your food and drinks on a separate check, says Aranita. \"It's easier to deal with than having to split a check in complicated percentages at the end of the night.\"  If you do choose separate checks, tell your server that at the start of the meal, not the end. That way they can make note of everyone's individual orders. Not every establishment offers this option, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Scenario 2: Everyone ordered alcohol except me — and now they want to split the tab fair and square! Speak up, says Aranita. \"Just be like, 'Hey guys — I didn't drink.' Usually, that's enough for everyone to reconfigure the bill to make it fairer. The problems only arise when you don't speak up.\"  If you are ordering round after round of $20 cocktail drinks, be conscious of the people in your party who didn't order as much as you. When the bill arrives, \"maybe pick up a larger portion of the tip\" to make up for your drinks, says Aranita.  Scenario 3: We're a party of six. Is it OK to ask the server to split the check six ways?  Many restaurants now have updated point-of-sale systems that make it easier for servers to split the check in myriad ways, says Aranita. But it doesn't always mean you should ask them to do so.  Aranita, who has also been a bartender and server, recommends a maximum of two to four credit cards. Servers \"have enough to deal with\" when working with a large party, especially on a busy night. And running several cards with different tip percentages isn't ideal.  \"If you're a party of six, just put down two credit cards\" and Venmo each other what you owe, she says. This approach also works out great for that person in your group who’s obsessed with racking up credit card points.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Scenario 4: It's my birthday. My friends should pay for my meal, right? In American culture, it's assumed that if your friends take you out to dinner for your birthday, they will cover your meal. But that's not always the case, says Aranita.  If you set up your own birthday dinner, don't expect to people to pay for you, she says. You picked the restaurant and invited your friends on your terms. So in this scenario, put down your card at the end of the meal. Your dining mates may pick up your tab, but if they don't, \"that's perfectly fine. You're saying: 'I can celebrate me and also pay for me.' \"  Scenario 5: It's my friends' first time at my favorite restaurant. I'm going to order an appetizer that I think everyone at the table will love. We're all splitting the cost of that, right? It can be easy to get swept away by the menu at a favorite restaurant, but don't assume your dining partners share the same enthusiasm for the twice-fried onion rings. \"You have to get their consent at the beginning of the meal. Say, 'hey, is it cool if I order appetizers for the table?' \" says Aranita. If you forgot to ask this question, assume that you will pay for the order.  This episode was produced by Sylvie Douglis.

Gaza's civil defense agency said there were initial reports of at least nine people killed and injured in Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Younis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The attacks came as Israel and Hamas traded accusations of violating the ceasefire deal that began on Oct. 10. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had ordered immediate \" forceful strikes \" in Gaza following a meeting with his senior security ministers. They discussed what the response should be after accusing Hamas of attempting to stage the return of the partial remains of a hostage whose body the militant group was supposed to hand over under the terms of the ceasefire. The Israeli military released drone footage that it said showed Hamas operatives burying a bag with remains in the ground so that the International Committee of the Red Cross could find them. Netanyahu called the move a violation of the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire. Hamas said in a statement that Israel's allegations were \"baseless and aimed at misleading public opinion.\" It said, \"The occupation is seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps against our people, in blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that Hamas would \"pay a heavy price for attacking\" Israeli troops in Gaza and failing to return deceased hostages.  On Oct. 19, the Israeli military carried out a series of airstrikes in Gaza after two of its soldiers were killed in Rafah. After those Israeli strikes, dozens of people, Trump said the ceasefire was still in place.  Hamas said it had \"no connection\" to the shooting of Israeli soldiers in Rafah. It said it would stick to the ceasefire and called on mediators to \"take immediate action\" to press Israel to stop its attacks in violation of the agreement.  U.S. Vice President Vance, who recently visited Israel, said he was confident the ceasefire would remain in effect despite the violence. \"That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be little skirmishes here and there,\" Vance told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. \"We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an [Israeli] soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president's peace is going to hold despite that.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5566664","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"15:47:00-04:00","title":"How Israel is winning the wars and losing the peace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines how Israel has achieved military victories against Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, and key regional leaders such as Sinwar, Deif, Haniyah, Nasrallah, and Assad, yet failed to achieve lasting peace or political stability.

wars and losing the peace \n         By Greg Myre \n        \n           Tuesday, October 28, 2025 • 3:47 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         TEL AVIV — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently stood next to President Trump in Israel's parliament in Jerusalem and summarized the last two years of war: \"Israel achieved amazing victories over Hamas and the entire Iran terror axis — Sinwar, Deif, Haniyah, Nasrallah, Assad — they're all gone.\"  This list refers to countries (Iran, Syria and Lebanon), groups (Hamas and Hezbollah) and individuals (Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyah of Hamas, Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah and Bashar al-Assad of Syria) that have been Israel's main enemies for decades.   Yet at the same time, \"While Netanyahu was winning wars, he was not able to win any of the peace, or any of the peaces,\" said  Paul Salem , who's based in Lebanon with the  Middle East  Institute . \"He was not able to turn his military victories into sustainable political wins. He was digging Israel deeper into a hole.\" Israel has also come under withering international criticism. This is mostly over the Gaza war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which Israeli authorities say killed 1,144 people. In its ferocious response, Israel's military killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza health officials. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Israel faces charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and Netanyahu has been charged with war crimes at the International Criminal Court. Israel and Netanyahu reject both these charges. For Israel, \"From a purely military perspective, things look much better. From a foreign policy perspective, things could not have deteriorated much more than they have,\" said  Chuck Freilich , a former deputy national security advisor in Israel. \"I think the war had a long-term impact,\" he added.  \"It's going to take quite a while for Israel to regain its international standing of, let's say, 30 or 40 years ago.\"  Back in the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians spent much of the decade trying to negotiate an end to their conflict, with the international community supporting those efforts. Friction in Israel-U.S. ties Today, the criticism of Israel comes from all directions. Outrage in the Arab world. Mass protests in European cities and on U.S. college campuses. Yet Freilich says his biggest worry is the U.S.-Israel relationship, which he has seen from both sides. He was born and raised in the U.S. He moved to Israel, where he became a security official. He still lives in Israel, but teaches for a semester each year in the U.S., currently at Georgetown University.  \"For me, this is really the only existential threat that Israel faces, is a loss of American support,\" he said. \"Israel needs the United States critically for just about every issue it faces.\" Israel used to have rock-solid bipartisan support in the U.S.  \"Today there is an absolute collapse of support on the Democratic side, and we see the beginnings of a decrease in support on the Republican side,\" he said.  Trump remains a staunch supporter of Israel, but he has set red lines. He's pressuring Israel to stick to the ceasefire. He's explicitly told Israel not to annex the West Bank, where a half-million Jewish settlers live on land Palestinians claim for a future state. Salem says with these actions, Trump is showing a willingness to go against Israel in ways that previous U.S. presidents have not. \"He doesn't always seem to follow what Israel or the Israeli lobby or the prime minister of Israel wants,\" said Salem.  Before the Gaza war erupted in 2023, some younger Arabs were not as passionate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as earlier generations, which championed the Palestinian cause since the first major war in 1948.  The latest Gaza war has energized the younger generation, said Salem. \"This is a war that was carried live on TikTok, and that did not happen in 1948,\" he said. \"This has branded an entire generation.\" Relations cool, but agreements hold The recent fighting was also a stress test of the  Abraham Accords . Those are the 2020 agreements worked out in Trump's first term, which established relations between Israel and four Muslim countries. The war produced strains, but the agreements survived, notes  Erel Margalit , a prominent Israeli venture capitalist who began doing business in Gulf states after the accords were signed. \"We have companies that are dealing with [United Arab Emirates] banks and Bahrain banks and Saudi banks and insurance companies and the government,\" he said.  Speaking more broadly about Israel-Arab business ties, which had largely stalled in the past couple  years, he said, \"It's not being discussed too much out in the open. It's not being hidden, but it's quiet. I think a lot of it is coming back.\"  However, an improvement in Israel's international standing is likely to take time.   What the region needs, said Margalit, are Israeli and Arab political leaders who can move beyond the endless cycle of conflict. \"There needs to be more political leadership, because the region could certainly use new initiatives as we're moving forward from this war,\" he said.  A lot may depend on what happens next in Gaza. If the ceasefire holds and rebuilding starts in Gaza, then Israel's isolation may begin to ease. But the ceasefire remains shaky. On Tuesday, Israel accused Hamas of firing on Israeli forces still in Gaza. Netanyahu ordered \"forceful strikes\" in response, and Palestinian officials reported air strikes in Gaza City late Tuesday night.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/dhs-plan-capture-maduro-pilot-planes-7915d5a0819ceb518a8ca2b47da8b2e5","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"EU Launches New AI Regulations to Ensure Transparency and Ethical Use in Critical Sectors","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In April 2024, the European Union launched a comprehensive set of regulations governing the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.

In exchange, the agent told the pilot in a clandestine meeting, the aviator would be made a very rich man.  The conversation was tense, and the pilot left noncommittal, though he provided the agent, Edwin Lopez, with his cell number — a sign he might be interested in helping the U.S. government. Over the next 16 months, even after retiring from his government job in July, Lopez kept at it, chatting with the pilot over an encrypted messaging app.  The untold, intrigue-filled saga of how Lopez tried to flip the pilot has all the elements of a Cold War spy thriller — luxury private jets, a secret meeting at an airport hangar, high-stakes diplomacy and the delicate wooing of a key Maduro lieutenant. There was even a final machination aimed at rattling the Venezuelan president about the pilot’s true loyalties. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n More broadly, the scheme reveals the extent — and often  slapdash  fashion — to which the U.S. has for years sought to topple Maduro, who it blames for destroying the oil-rich nation’s democracy while providing a lifeline to drug traffickers, terrorist groups and communist-run Cuba.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n   \n      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.\n   \n   \n     Follow on \n     \n   \n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has taken an even harder line.

It started with a tip on Maduro’s planes The plot was hatched when a tipster showed up at the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic on April 24, 2024, when Joe Biden was president. The informant purported to have information about Maduro’s planes, according to three of the officials familiar with the matter.  Lopez, 50, was then an attaché at the embassy and agent for Homeland Security Investigations, a part of the Department of Homeland Security.  A wiry former U.S. Army Ranger from Puerto Rico, Lopez was leading the agency’s investigations into transnational criminal networks with a presence in the Caribbean, after a storied career taking down drug gangs, money launderers and fraudsters. His work dismantling an illicit money-changing operation in Miami even earned him a public rebuke in 2010 from Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s predecessor. The embassy assignment was to be his last before retirement.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The embassy was closed, although Lopez was still at his desk. He was handed a 3x5 index card with the tipster’s name and phone number. When he called, the tipster claimed that two planes used by Maduro were in the Dominican Republic undergoing costly repairs. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     This combination of images, obtained from 2025 documents released by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, shows a Dassault Falcon 900 EX, with the tail number T7-ESPRT, that was seized in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, at the request of the United States in May 2024, top, and a Dassault Falcon 2000EX, with the tail number YV3360, seized in Santo Domingo at the request of the United States in February 2025, bottom.

The  planes were also subject to seizure  – for violating those same sanctions. Locating the aircraft was easy – they were housed in La Isabela executive airport in Santo Domingo. Tracing them to Maduro would take federal investigators months. As they built that case, they learned that the Venezuelan president had dispatched five pilots to the island to retrieve the multimillion-dollar jets – a Dassault Falcon 2000EX and Dassault Falcon 900EX.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A plan comes together Lopez had an epiphany, according to the current and former officials familiar with the operation: What if he could persuade the pilot to fly Maduro to a place where the U.S. could arrest him?  Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on  federal narco-terrorism charges  accusing him of flooding the U.S. with cocaine.  The DHS agent secured permission from his superiors and Dominican authorities to question the pilots, overcoming the officials’ concerns about creating a diplomatic rift with Venezuela.  At the airport hangar, a short distance from the jet, Lopez and fellow agents asked each pilot to join them individually in a small conference room. There was no agenda, the agents said. They just wanted to talk. The agents pretended not to know that the pilots spent their time jetting around Maduro and other top officials. They spoke to each airman for about an hour, saving their biggest target for last: Villegas, who the agents had determined was Maduro’s regular pilot.  Villegas was a member of the elite presidential honor guard and colonel in the Venezuelan air force. A former Venezuelan official who regularly traveled with the president described him as friendly, reserved and trusted by Maduro. The planes he flew were used to shuttle Maduro across the globe –- often to U.S. adversaries like Iran, Cuba and Russia. In a December 2023 video posted online by Maduro, Villegas can be seen holding up a radio in the cockpit as the president trades patriotic slogans with the pilot of a  Russian Sukhoi fighter jet. Lopez called Villegas into the room, and they bantered for a while about celebrities the pilot had shuttled around, his military service and the types of jets he was licensed to fly, according to two of the people familiar with the operation. After about 15 minutes, the pilot began to grow tense, and his legs started to shake.  The agent drilled in more sharply: Had the pilot ever flown Chávez or Maduro? Villegas at first tried to dodge the questions, but eventually admitted he had been a pilot for both leaders. Villegas showed the agents photos on his phone of him and the two presidents on various trips. He also provided details about Venezuelan military installations he had visited. Unbeknownst to Villegas, one of Lopez’s colleagues recorded the conversation on a cell phone.  As the conversation wrapped up, the two people said, Lopez made his pitch: In exchange for secretly ferrying Maduro into America’s hands, the pilot would become very rich and beloved by millions of his compatriots. The rendezvous could be of the pilot’s choosing: the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico or the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Villegas didn’t tip his hand. Yet, before departing, he gave Lopez his cell number.  ‘Treasure trove of intelligence’ Villegas and the other pilots returned to Venezuela without the aircraft, which they were told lacked the proper clearances.  Meanwhile, the U.S. government was assembling a federal forfeiture case to seize the jets. It seized one, registered in the European microstate of San Marino to a shell company from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in September 2024.  It seized the other in February during the first overseas trip by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the top U.S. diplomat.  At a press conference at the airport in the Dominican Republic, Lopez briefed the secretary in front of the press. Lopez told Rubio that the plane contained a “  treasure trove of intelligence ,” including the names of Venezuelan air force officers and detailed information about its movements. Lopez affixed a seizure warrant to the jet. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, right, listens to Edwin F.

The task would not be easy. Maduro had made it exceedingly costly for anyone who turns against him. Since taking office in 2013, he has brutally repressed protests, leading to scores of arrests, while jailing even once-powerful allies suspected of disloyalty.  Even so, Lopez plugged away. The pair texted on WhatsApp and Telegram about a dozen times. But the conversations seemed to go nowhere.  In July, Lopez retired. But he couldn’t let Villegas go. He sought guidance from the tight-knit community of exiled opposition leaders he got to know as a lawman. One described the former agent as obsessed with bringing Maduro to justice.  “He felt he had an unfinished mission to complete,” said an exiled member of Maduro’s opposition who spoke on the condition of anonymity over concerns about his safety. That commitment, he added, makes Lopez “more valuable to us than many of Maduro’s biggest opponents inside Venezuela.” After the August text about the  $50 million reward , Lopez sent another saying there was “still time left to be Venezuela’s hero and be on the right side of history.” But he did not hear back. On Sept. 18, Lopez was watching the news of Trump’s buildup in the Caribbean when he saw a post on X by an anonymous plane spotter who had closely tracked the comings and goings of Maduro’s jetliners over the years, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. The user,  @Arr3ch0 , a play on Venezuelan slang for “furious,” posted a screenshot of a flight tracking map that showed a presidential Airbus making an odd loop after taking off from Caracas.  “Where are you heading?” wrote Lopez, using a new number. “Who is this?” responded Villegas, either not recognizing the number or feigning ignorance. When Lopez pressed about what they discussed in the Dominican Republic, Villegas grew combative, calling Lopez a “coward.” “We Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,” Villegas wrote. “The last thing we are is traitors.”  Lopez sent him a photo of them talking to each other on a red leather couch at the airplane hangar the previous year. “Are you crazy?” Villegas replied.  “A little…,” wrote Lopez. Two hours later, Lopez tried one last time, mentioning Villegas’ three children by name and a better future he said awaited them in the U.S.  “The window for a decision is closing,” Lopez wrote, shortly before Villegas blocked his number. “Soon it will be too late.” Trying to rattle Maduro Realizing that Villegas wasn’t going to join the plan, Lopez and others in the anti-Maduro movement decided to try to unnerve the Venezuelan leader, according to three of the people familiar with the operation.  The day after the testy WhatsApp exchange between Lopez and Villegas, Marshall Billingslea – a close ally of Venezuela’s opposition – took action. A former national security official in Republican administrations, Billingslea had for weeks been trolling Maduro. Now he brought Villegas into his cyberbullying.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     President Nicolas Maduro flashes victory signs during Indigenous Day in Caracas, Venezuela, Oct 12, 2025.

Billingslea included  side-by-side photographs  that would be sure to raise eyebrows. One was the same one that Lopez had shared with Villegas the day before over WhatsApp, except the agent had been cropped out of it. The other was an official air force photo with a gold star denoting his new rank affixed to the shoulder epaulet. The X post was published at 3:01 p.m. — a minute before another sanctioned Airbus that Maduro has been known to fly took off from Caracas’ airport. Twenty minutes later, the plane  unexpectedly returned  to the airport.  The birthday wish, seen by almost 3 million people, sent shockwaves across Venezuelan social media, as Maduro’s opponents speculated the pilot had been ordered to return to face interrogation. Others wondered if he would be jailed. Nobody saw or heard from Villegas for days. Then, on Sept. 24, the pilot resurfaced, in an air force flight suit, on a widely followed TV show hosted by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.  Cabello laughed off any suggestion that Venezuela’s military could be bought. As he praised Villegas’ loyalty, calling him an  “unfailing, kick-ass patriot,  ” the pilot stood by silently, raising a clenched fist in a display of his loyalty.  —- Contact AP’s global investigative team at  [email protected]  or  https://www.ap.org/tips/ __ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano contributed to this report from Caracas, Venezuela."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589729","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:02:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he's confident of a deal ahead of Xi meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, during a visit to Gyeongju, South Korea, former U.S. President Donald Trump expressed strong confidence in achieving a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their bilateral meeting at the Asia Pacific Economic Forum.

ahead of Xi meeting \n         By Anthony Kuhn \n        \n           Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 6:02 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         GYEONGJU, SOUTH KOREA – President Trump on Wednesday confidently predicted striking a deal with China's leader in a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Forum, following a period of trade tensions that have threatened to escalate. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think we're going have a deal, I think it will be a good deal for both, and that's really a great result,\" Trump told a lunch meeting of APEC business executives in the southern city of Gyeongju.  \"That's better than fighting and going through all sorts of problems,\" he added ahead of the Thursday meeting with President Xi Jinping. \"No reason for it.\" Trump said that he could reduce tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for a commitment from Beijing to curb exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl. \"I expect to be lowering that because I believe that they're going to help us with the fentanyl situation,\" Trump told reporters en route to Gyeongju. \"They're going to be doing what they can do.\" The U.S. currently imposes a 20% tariff on Chinese imports, in addition to other tariffs, because the U.S. government believes China has not done enough to restrict fentanyl precursor exports. In response, Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. U.S. and Chinese economic officials met over the weekend in Malaysia to build the framework of a trade deal that would include China resuming purchases of U.S. soybeans. The deal would also include China delaying the imposition of export restrictions on rare earths, while the U.S. would hold off on raising tariffs by 100%. Both Beijing and Washington are trading accusations that the other side's economic coercion is wreaking havoc on the global economy. \"This is China versus the world,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about China's rare earth export controls this month. \"They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it,\" he said. \"The U.S. has raised tariffs so high that it's brought globalization to the verge of breakdown,\" says Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China. He notes that besides tariffs, the U.S. has raised port fees this month on Chinese-owned or operated ships docking at U.S. ports. It has suggested controls on U.S. exports of software to China. And it has proposed barring Chinese air carriers headed to and from the U.S. from flying through Russian airspace. China's airlines have a cost advantage, because Russia allows Chinese carriers to transit their airspace, but not U.S. ones. \"You can make China accept your rise in tariffs. But you can't keep overwhelmingly pounding on China so hard,\" he says. \"China's retaliation is to show China and the world that the U.S. can't just keep us cornered,\" Zhu adds. Trump has also mentioned that he wants to discuss nuclear arms control with Xi, and possibly include China in U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control negotiations. Despite speculation that Trump might try to revive nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on this trip, that now seems off the table. Trump told South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the start of bilateral talks that talks with Xi were his main goal. \"We're looking forward to seeing him [Xi], and that was our focus, really, for this visit.\" Trump told Lee he was aware that the two Koreas remain technically in a state of war, and assured Lee that \"we will see what we can do to get that straightened out. You know that I'll be working on this very hard.\" As Trump was visiting South Korea, Pyongyang said it had conducted successful cruise missile tests. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587829","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"If you liked 'Sandwich,' you'll love 'Wreck,' its warm, witty sequel","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Catherine Newman's novel Wreck, a sequel to her 2024 book Sandwich, follows Rocky, a witty and deeply empathetic mother, as she navigates life in western Massachusetts two years after a family vacation on Cape Cod.

       By Heller McAlpin \n        \n           Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Some characters are just too good to let go after a single book: Olive Kitteridge, Hercule Poirot, Tom Sawyer. And now, in  Wreck,  Catherine Newman has given Rocky, the sharp-witted, neurotically doting mother who narrates her delicious 2024 novel,  Sandwich ,  a repeat engagement. When we first met her in  Sandwich , Rocky was thrilled to have her husband, grown children, and aging parents all together under one roof during the family's annual vacation on Cape Cod. But squeezed between generations and moodily menopausal, she was feeling the weight of both past secrets and future change. Wreck  is even funnier, yet also more earnest in its explorations of life's fundamental impermanence. It picks up the story of Rocky and her brood two years later, back home in western Massachusetts.  Wreck  can stand on its own, but chances are, you'll want to read both books. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Wreck's  cover, like  Sandwich's,  features a soft-focus photograph of an alluring porch-fronted all-American house that telegraphs that this novel is not about a real estate teardown. In fact, the title refers to Rocky's state after being knocked off-kilter by a serious health scare and a local train crash that hits too close to home.  Newman's novel is animated more by wit, warmth, and worry than by plot. Its plot, such as it is, is set in motion when insomniacal Rocky, awake in the wee hours, googles the insidious rash that is spreading over her body. That's mistake number one. Mistake number two is reading a local news report about a high school classmate of her son's, who has been killed in a collision with an oncoming train at a railroad crossing. The rash leads to an increasingly alarming medical odyssey, while the train crash leads to disturbing theories about how this might have happened. One plausible explanation involves a consulting firm that advised the railroad to save money on maintenance. (It's more complicated than that, but I'll leave readers to untangle the situation.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This isn't the first time Newman has made light of dire diseases:  We All Want Impossible Things,  her moving and improbably funny first novel about the death of a dear friend, was so convincing I thought it was a memoir. At her best, Newman evokes Nora Ephron. Rocky works from home writing what she's well aware are silly Home-ec type articles for various publications. She's a font of hilarious riffs about the absurdity of life — the ridiculous complexity of juice bar menus and the frustrations of modern medicine. She complains to her family about being fired from her own \"etiquette column,\" but happily, we get to read her over-the-top angry email drafts to her editors before she wisely deletes them. Sometimes, Rocky's life feels like an updated version of cozy mid-century sitcoms about idealized American families. She's still the one cooking dinner every night and making coffee every morning for her unerringly supportive husband Nick, a physical therapist, her grieving 92-year-old father, who moved into their home temporarily a year ago after his wife's death, and her anxious, queer, migraine-afflicted daughter, Willa, who is back home from college, working in a local university lab while applying to Ph.D. programs in neuroscience. But unlike those sitcom moms, Rocky is a regular customer at her favorite marijuana dispensary. (A camping trip where she and her best friend get stoned and laugh uncontrollably falls flat.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       One of Newman's strengths as a writer is her ability to evoke widely shared predicaments with fresh images. When Rocky's father can't recall an old friend's name, she writes, \"I know this exact feeling. I can be on my mental hands and knees, flailing around under the couch of my mind with a hockey stick, trying to sweep out a name I can't remember — and all I'll dredge up is a Ping-Pong ball, a catnip mouse, and a spool of thread. If I look away, though, sometimes it might creep out on its own little feet.\"  Newman can veer sentimental, but she mostly pulls off another mix of irreverent quips and heartfelt reverence in  Wreck.  At one point, frequently flippant Rocky describes herself as almost pathologically empathic,\" an undammable river of mother love.\"  During soothing woodland walks with her family and consoling cuddles with her daughter and cats, that river pretty much overflows its banks. Rocky gushes, \"this moment, here, with my beautiful daughter in the beautiful world.\" Smitten parents will relate. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/california-house-gerrymandering-gavin-newsom-trump-2a12e97b48e2b6bdfe6891264756ff9c","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"New Virus Variant Detected: Public Health Response Accelerated","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new variant of the virus has been detected, prompting immediate public health responses.

(AP) — In a stretch of Northern California known for farming, ranching and a rural way of life, residents worry  a ballot measure  to redraw U.S. House maps is all but certain to dilute what little political power they possess in the heavily Democratic state. If Proposition 50 passes, voters in three northern counties that went strongly for President  Donald Trump  in the last three elections would share a representative with some of the state’s wealthiest and most liberal coastal communities. Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail. “Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we’ll have absolutely nothing,” Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family’s gun shop. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Voting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It’s an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to  counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas  to gain five more Republican seats. He says it’s necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters.

Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and  belief in election conspiracies  are common.

The median household income tops $140,000 — roughly double that of Shasta County. It’s part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It’s represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.  LaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to  a statewide “no” campaign . Brenda Haynes, who works in LaMalfa’s district office, said the congressman has joined residents waving flags on highway overpasses. His campaign declined a request for a reporter to shadow him on the trail. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Brenda Haynes wears earrings to show her support of President Donald Trump during a No on Prop 50 rally, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in Redding, Calif.

She added: “I don’t know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.” Newsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Trump’s agenda and counter Republican efforts to pickup seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in  Missouri ,  North Carolina  and  Indiana  are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in  Virginia , meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,” Newsom said in a recent virtual campaign event. “This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.” But voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A woman, left, runs on a sidewalk in Sausalito, Calif., as the San Francisco skyline is seen in the background, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.

Lawmakers, for example,  banned counties from hand-counting ballots  in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.  Some said they worry that national Republicans won’t put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes. “You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,” said Jones, the former county supervisor. “And they’re just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.” Voters are divided Not all voters are dreading a change.  Warren Swanson, a Redding resident of more than 40 years, called LaMalfa “Do Nothing Doug.” His wife, Tara Swanson, also voted “yes” on the measure, partly because it promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission after the 2030 Census. “Do two wrongs make a right? It’s a tough one for those of us who think along those lines,” Tara Swanson said.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, stands behind the counter at his family’s gun shop in Redding, Calif., Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

Shasta resident who works with the state food assistance program. But the fight is far from over for Republican voters in California, said Walter Stephen Rubke, a 38-year-old who moved to Redding last year. Many  young people  are supporting conservatives, he said, and he expects continual resistance from GOP voters even if the measure passes.  “I see a hard path ahead,” he said. “But I feel confident. I feel hopeful.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-illinois-ice-border-patrol-immigration-bovino-d1cf9ce5309f0175a24fdd276f52f06c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"04:03:19+00:00","title":"Chicago Judge Orders Border Patrol Official to Daily Briefings Over Tear Gas Use in Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. District Judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, has taken an unprecedented step by ordering senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino to attend daily briefings to report on the enforcement of immigration laws and the use of force.

2025-10-28T04:03:19+00:00\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — A judge in Chicago took the rare step Tuesday of ordering a senior U.S. Border Patrol official to brief her every night, an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the government’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and tear gas thrown by officers. Greg Bovino, who has become  the public face  of the Trump administration’s city-by-city immigration sweeps, must sit for a daily 6 p.m. briefing to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said. Ellis also demanded full use-of-force reports from agents involved in a blitz that has netted over  1,800 arrests since September. “Yes, ma’am,” Bovino responded to each request. Phillip Turner, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the judge’s order is extremely unusual. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I’ve been a lawyer for almost 50 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Turner told The Associated Press. Bovino got an earful from Ellis as soon as he settled into the witness chair in his green uniform. The judge quickly expressed concerns about video and other images from the campaign against illegal immigration. The hearing was the latest in a lawsuit by news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force,  including tear gas , during demonstrations. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson listed as full participant in practice and speaks with reporters \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump administration shakes up ICE leadership across the country in major overhaul, AP sources say \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Flight is diverted to Boston after a passenger stabs 2 teens with a fork, authorities say \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “My role is not to tell you that you can or cannot enforce validly passed laws by Congress. … My role is simply to see that in the enforcement of those laws, the agents are acting in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution,” Ellis said. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n   \n      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.\n   \n   \n     Follow on \n     \n   \n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Bovino is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, one of nine on the Mexican border. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The judge wants him to meet her in person daily “to hear about how the day went.” “I suspect that now knowing where we are and that he understands what I expect, I don’t know that we’re going to see a whole lot of tear gas deployed in the next week,” Ellis said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ?

These kids, you can imagine, their sense of safety was shattered on Saturday. And it’s going to take a long time for that to come back, if ever.” Ellis ordered Bovino to produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz. She first demanded them by the end of Tuesday, but Bovino said it would be “physically impossible” because of the “sheer amount.” Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals have been one-sided.

She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order. Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training. Attorneys representing a coalition of news outlets and protesters claim he violated the judge’s use-of-force order in Little Village, a Mexican enclave in Chicago, and they filed an image of him allegedly “throwing tear gas into a crowd without justification.” Over the weekend, masked agents and unmarked SUVs were seen on Chicago’s wealthier, predominantly white North Side, where video showed chemical agents deployed in a street. Agents have been recorded using tear gas several times over the past few weeks. Bovino also led the immigration operation in Los Angeles in recent months, leading to thousands of arrests. Agents smashed car windows, blew open a door to a house and patrolled MacArthur Park on horseback."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/drug-cartels-hegseth-pacific-8f9f65dd67c0bc55b6dd70b109df0216","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"13:51:25+00:00","title":"U.S. Conducts Multiple Strikes in Pacific, Escalates Drug War Amid Diplomatic Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant escalation of its anti-drug campaign, the U.S. military conducted multiple strikes in the eastern Pacific Ocean off Colombia, killing 14 people and leaving one survivor.

in the eastern Pacific Ocean  on four boats accused of carrying drugs, killing 14 people and leaving one survivor in the deadliest single day since the Trump administration began its divisive campaign against drug trafficking in the waters off South America. It was the first time multiple strikes were announced in a single day as  the pace of the attacks  has escalated. The nearly two-month campaign and U.S. military buildup have strained ties with allies in the region and opened speculation that the moves are aimed at  ousting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , whom the U.S. has accused of narcoterrorism. A statement provided by a Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the operation, said the strikes were conducted Monday off the coast of Colombia.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Following one attack on a boat, the military spotted a person in the water clinging to some wreckage.

The American attacks drew renewed criticism from the regional ally.  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily press conference that she asked the foreign affairs secretary and the navy to meet with the U.S. ambassador in Mexico to discuss the issue because “we do not agree with these attacks.”  “We want all international treaties to be respected,” she said.  The strikes also have  strained ties with other historic allies  like Colombia, a country whose intelligence is crucial to American anti-narcotics operations in the region. In an escalating clash between the Republican U.S. president and Colombia’s first leftist leader, the Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on Colombian President  Gustavo Petro , his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Petro vehemently denies the allegations. In a strike earlier this month with two survivors, the U.S. military rescued the pair and  repatriated them to Colombia and Ecuador . Authorities  released the Ecuadorian man  after prosecutors said they had no evidence he committed a crime in Ecuador. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Hegseth posted footage of the latest strikes to social media in which two boats can be seen moving through the water in separate clips. One is visibly laden with a large amount of parcels or bundles. Both then suddenly explode and are seen in flames. The third strike appears to have been conducted on a pair of boats that were stationary in the water alongside each other. They appear to be largely empty, with at least two people seen moving before an explosion engulfs both boats. Hegseth said “the four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes that began in early September and had been spaced weeks apart. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     In this image provided by the U.S. Air Force, a Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber flies with Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II aircraft in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, Oct. 15, 2025.

The Trump administration said several of the strikes have been off the coast of Venezuela or blamed them on the  Tren de Aragua gang , which originated in a Venezuelan prison and has been declared a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. After the Pentagon announced Friday that it was dispatching an aircraft carrier to join  the eight warships and thousands of troops  already in the region, Maduro said the U.S. government was  “fabricating” a war against him . Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted the  U.S. is taking part in a counterdrug operation , while also accusing Maduro’s government of allowing and participating in the shipment of narcotics.  The U.S. military also flew a pair of  supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast  of Venezuela. President Donald Trump has said he has the “legal authority” to carry out the attacks on the alleged drug-carrying boats and suggested similar strikes could be done on land. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In his announcement of the latest strikes, Hegseth continued to draw parallels between the military’s  actions against drug trafficking and the war on terrorism  following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He claimed that cartels “have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same.” Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in  an “armed conflict” with drug cartels  and proclaiming the criminal organizations to be unlawful combatants, relying on the same legal authority used by President George W.

employees during the government shutdown, saying that labor unions were likely to prevail on their claims that the cuts were arbitrary and politically motivated. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted a preliminary injunction that bars the firings while a lawsuit challenging them plays out. She had previously issued a temporary restraining order against the job cuts that was set to expire Wednesday. Illston, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has said she believes the evidence will ultimately show the mass firings were illegal and in excess of authority. Federal agencies are enjoined from issuing layoff notices or acting on notices issued since the government shut down Oct. 1. Illston said that her order does not apply to notices sent before the shutdown.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Republican administration has slashed jobs in education, health and other areas it says are favored by Democrats.

About 4,100 layoff notices have gone out since Oct. 10, some sent to work email addresses that furloughed employees are not allowed to check. Some personnel were called back to work, without pay, to issue layoff notices to others. The lawsuit has expanded to include employees represented by additional labor unions, including the National Treasury Employees Union, the American Federation of Teachers, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. All Cabinet departments and two dozen independent agencies are included in the lawsuit.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any deal to reopen the federal government address expiring  health care subsidies  that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans.

Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many  to limit new work  to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, some sizeable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new  tariffs  and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names  like Amazon , are redirecting money to investments like artificial intelligence. In such cases, “it’s not so much AI directly  taking jobs , but AI’s appetite for cash that might be taking jobs,” said Jason Schloetzer, professor business administration at Georgetown University’s McDonough School. He pointed to wider “trade offs” from employment to infrastructure investment seen across companies today. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were  cut by the thousands .

Here are some companies that have moved to cut jobs recently. Amazon Amazon said Tuesday that it will  cut about 14,000 corporate jobs , close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. CEO Andy Jassy previously said he anticipated generative AI  would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce  in the coming years. And he has worked to aggressively cut costs overall since 2021.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n UPS United Parcel Service  has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts  this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs.  In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said it’s cut about 34,000 operational positions — and the company announced another 14,000 role reductions, mostly within management. Combined, that’s much higher  than the roughly 20,000 cuts  UPS forecast earlier this year. UPS also said it closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target Last week, Target that it would  eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions , or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. Target said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts — with Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke noting that “too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions.” The retailer is also looking to  rebuild its customer base . Target reported flat or declining comparable sales in nine of the past eleven quarters. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Nestlé In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be  cutting 16,000 jobs globally  — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. The cuts arrive as Nestlé and others face headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed  tariffs . The company announced price hikes over the summer to offset higher coffee and cocoa costs. Lufthansa Group In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of  artificial intelligence , digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Most of the lost jobs would be  in Germany , and the focus would be on administrative rather than operational roles, the company said.

Novo Nordisk — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring as the company works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. ConocoPhillips Oil giant ConocoPhillips has said it plans to  lay off up to a quarter of its workforce , as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips confirmed the layoffs on Sept. 3, noting that 20% to 25% of the company’s employees and contractors would be impacted worldwide. At the time, ConocoPhillips had a total headcount of about 13,000 — or between 2,600 and 3,250 workers. Most reductions were expected to take place before the end of 2025. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Intel Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business as it lags behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. In a July memo to employees, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to  end the year with 75,000 “core” workers , excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a  15% workforce reduction . Microsoft In May, Microsoft began  began laying off about 6,000 workers  across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be  cutting 9,000 positions  — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The latest job cuts hit Microsoft’s Xbox video game business and other divisions. The company has cited “organizational changes,” with many executives characterizing the layoffs as part of a push to trim management layers. But the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. Procter & Gamble In June, Procter & Gamble said it would  cut up to 7,000 jobs  over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. In July, P&G said it would hike prices  on about a quarter of its products  due to the newly-imposed import taxes, although it’s since said it  expects to take less of a hit  than previously anticipated for the 2026 fiscal year."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/bill-gates-climate-change-united-nations-4108f76e746d1e3e13845f33b8ae7007","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"04:04:48+00:00","title":"Bill Gates Proposes Strategic Pivot in Climate Policy: Focus on Poverty and Disease Over Emission Reduction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bill Gates, through a memo released ahead of the upcoming U.N. climate conference in Brazil, argues that the global climate effort should shift focus from limiting temperature rise to addressing poverty and preventing disease—especially in the world’s poorest nations.

serious problem but it won’t be the end of civilization. He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.  A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said.  In a memo released Tuesday , Gates said the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world’s poorest countries. If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today,” Gates told reporters during a roundtable discussion ahead of the release. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes — faster deployment of green technologies — to curb climate change. She called that unlikely. Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo “pointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.”  “There is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation.

But humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas by early 2028 that scientists say  crossing that 1.5-degree threshold  is now nearly unavoidable.  Breakthrough Energy focuses on areas where the cost of doing something cleanly is much higher than the polluting way, such as making clean steel and cement. Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world’s climate agenda. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Gates is optimistic innovation will curb climate change  Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios.  Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate  advances in clean energy technologies, he added. At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking.  Led by the United States , rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax. Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added. Vaccines become even more important in a warming world because children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply, he wrote. Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change, Gates said, citing  research from the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab  that found projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for the expected economic growth over the rest of this century.  Under these circumstances, he thinks the bar must be “very high” for what’s funded with aid money.  “If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.” ___ AP writer Seth Borenstein in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) — Two Florida university students and an advocacy group for retirees are asking a federal judge to let them intervene in a  lawsuit filed by young Republican groups  challenging the 2020 census results, saying they worry that the Trump administration won’t vigorously defend the case. The Trump administration has attacked the 2020 census results instead of defending the head count, the Alliance for Retired Americans and the two University of Central Florida students wrote Tuesday in their motion to intervene. They said they are concerned that the Republican administration and the young Republican groups could reach a settlement that would alter 2020 census numbers and undercount people in nursing homes and college dorms.

Differential privacy  adds intentional errors to the data to obscure the identity of any given participant in the 2020 census while still providing statistically valid information. Imputation  is a process  of using other information to fill in data about people when census-takers can’t reach anyone at a particular address. Although the 2020 census numbers were released during the first months of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, the execution and final planning for the head count, including the decision to use the statistical methods, took place during Trump’s first term.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The 2020  census faced unprecedented obstacles  from the COVID-19 pandemic, hurricanes and wildfires, social unrest and efforts by the Trump administration to end the count early. Group quarters such as college dorms and nursing homes were especially challenging because campuses were closed and care facilities restricted access in an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19. In the Florida lawsuit, three federal judges have been designated to hear arguments in the case. Two of the judges were nominated by Republican presidents, George H.W. Bush and Trump, and the third was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky:  @mikeysid.bsky.social"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-landfall-cuba-bahamas-8f71433722c9963554421d9258cd4d6b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"04:20:20+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa Pummeled Jamaica and Cuba with Catastrophic Winds and Floods","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm with 185 mph winds and record-low central pressure, made landfall in southwestern Jamaica, becoming one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record.

boulders tumbled onto roads Tuesday as  Hurricane Melissa  pummeled the Caribbean island as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, one of the  strongest Atlantic hurricanes  on record. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported as Melissa hit with 185 mph (295 kph) winds near New Hope, with officials cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment could be slow. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That’s the challenge.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n <!-- The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: -->\n Your browser does not support the <code>iframe</code> HTML tag.\n Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n\n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}(); \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Floodwaters trapped at least three families in their homes in the community of Black River in western Jamaica, and crews were unable to help them because of dangerous conditions, said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “Roofs were flying off,” he said. “We are hoping and praying that the situation will ease so that some attempt can be made to get to those persons.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He noted that extensive damage was reported in the southwestern parish of St. Elizabeth, which he said “is underwater.” McKenzie stressed that it was too early to talk about the extent of the damage because the hurricane — the  strongest to hit the island  since recordkeeping began 174 years ago — was still pummeling the country. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rohan Brown, with Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, warned that as Melissa moves off the coast, its counterclockwise rotation would bring a heavy storm surge to northern Jamaica through the night.

Nearly 15,000 people were in shelters in Jamaica and some 540,000 customers, or 77%, were without power, officials said. \n     \n         \n                \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n\n    \n \n\n                 \n                \n                 \n                     The U.S. Defense Department has released footage of views inside Hurricane Melissa.

The wind speed tied the 1935 hurricane and 2019’s  Hurricane Dorian , said hurricane scientists Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University and Brian McNoldy of the University of Miami. “It’s been a remarkable, just a beast of a storm,” Klotzbach told The Associated Press. With a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters) forecast, officials were concerned about hospitals along the coast.

The show’s host pleaded with listeners to let him know the safest hospital before an obstetrician called in to provide detailed directions on how to deliver a baby, if necessary. In Kingston, officials warned people to watch out for crocodiles that might be displaced from their habitats by flooding. McKenzie said the government was prepared for rescues immediately after the storm passes through: “We have boats, helicopters, you name it.” The storm already was blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. Tuesday evening, officials huddled in meetings to determine how best to clear the debris after the storm and distribute emergency relief supplies to avoid bottlenecks at Jamaica’s ports, said Richard Thompson, acting general director for Jamaica’s emergency management office. Officials hope to reopen the island’s airports by Thursday. U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits had food, medicine and other essential supplies positioned as they awaited a distribution rush after the storm.  Melissa takes aim at Cuba Melissa was expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba early Wednesday. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain was forecast in areas, along with a significant storm surge along the coast. In a televised address to the nation Tuesday, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel urged the population to not underestimate the power of the storm, “the strongest ever to hit national territory.” In the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba, people streamed into the home of 83-year-old Eduviges Figueroa at the foot of the Sierra Maestra mountains to seek shelter after fleeing their homes by bus, truck and even horse-drawn carts. “We’re helping as best we can,” she said. “Now I’m cooking for everyone.” People in Santiago de Cuba, the island’s second-largest city with more than 1 million people, spent Tuesday frantically preparing. Few people were on the streets, while state television showed Cubans in rural areas rounding up animals and protecting crops. Diamon Mendoza, 36, did not hide her concern about the unavoidable storm. “May God have mercy on us, because it’s coming with a lot of strength,” Mendoza said. “Anything can happen.” Authorities in eastern Holguín province prepared to evacuate more than 200,000 people Tuesday and evacuated a similar number of people earlier from the town of Banes. Reports on social media and state television showed blue and white buses ferrying evacuees to shelter early Tuesday. Families clutched babies and belongings and elderly people steadied themselves with canes as they disembarked. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For the first time in history, mosquitoes have been confirmed in Iceland, a country long considered free of such insects.

change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a powerful Category 4 storm with potential to intensify to Category 5, is threatening Jamaica and southern Haiti with extreme rainfall, flooding, landslides, and widespread damage.

disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41+00:00","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam, particularly in the historic cities of Hue and Hoi An, triggered catastrophic flooding and landslides, with water levels in rivers reaching unprecedented heights.

of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center suggests that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may significantly improve survival rates in cancer patients, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors.

were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025, aiming to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14.

first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/dutch-vote-in-knife-edge-election-seen-as-litmus-test-for-far-right","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:50:14+00:00","title":"Dutch vote in knife-edge snap elections seen as litmus test for far right","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Netherlands is holding a high-stakes snap election driven by intense debate over immigration and housing, with far-right leader Geert Wilders and his Freedom Party (PVV) projected to win the most seats.

immigration and housing issues that will test the strength of the  far right , which is on the rise across Europe.\n\nVoting began at 7:30am (06:30 GMT) on Wednesday, and polls suggested anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders and his far-right Freedom Party (PVV) are on course to win the largest number of seats in the 150-member House of Representatives. However, three more moderate parties are closing the gap, and half the  electorate  is undecided.\n\nAfter the results are known, parties have to negotiate the makeup of the next coalition government in a system of proportional representation that means no party can reach the 76 seats needed to govern alone.\n\nThe key question is whether other parties will work with Wilders – known as the “Dutch Trump”, a reference to the United States president – who sparked the elections by pulling the PVV out of a fractious four-way coalition and collapsing the previous government in a row over immigration.\n\nAll mainstream parties have ruled out a partnership with him again, finding his views too unpalatable and viewing him as an untrustworthy coalition partner. It seems likely that the leader of the party that polls second will most likely become prime minister.\n\nReporting from The Hague, Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen said the election campaign had been “dominated by calls to limit immigration” with “some violent protests against refugee centres”.\n\nIn a pre-election interview with the news agency AFP, Wilders said people were “fed up with mass immigration and the change of culture and the influx of people who really do not culturally belong here”.\n\n“The future of our nation is at stake,” he said.\n\nRob Jetten – leader of the centre-left D66 party, which wants to rein in migration but also accommodate asylum seekers – told Wilders that voters can “choose again tomorrow to listen to your grumpy hatred for another 20 years or choose with positive energy to simply get to work and tackle this problem and solve it”.\n\nFrans Timmermans, a former European Commission vice president who now leads the centre-left bloc of the Labour Party and Green Left, said in the final debate before the elections that he was “looking forward to the day – and that day is tomorrow – that we can put an end to the Wilders era”.\n\nBeyond immigration, the housing crisis that especially affects young people in the densely populated country has been a key campaign issue.\n\nThe electoral commission has registered 27 parties and 1,166 candidates running for the House of Representatives.\n\nThat means a big ballot paper because it bears the names of all the parties and the candidates on each party’s list.\n\nPolls close at 9pm (20:00 GMT)."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/bangladeshs-fugitive-ex-leader-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-in-2026-poll","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"09:16:57+00:00","title":"Bangladesh’s fugitive ex-leader warns of mass voter boycott in 2026 polls","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, the fugitive former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has warned that a ban on her Awami League party in the 2026 elections will lead to a mass boycott by millions of supporters, undermining democratic stability.

warned that excluding her Awami League party from next year’s elections would deepen divisions in the country as millions of her supporters are set to boycott the vote.\n\nNow exiled in India, the 78-year-old is currently being tried for crimes against humanity after being toppled in August 2024 by a  student-led uprising  that, according to the United Nations, saw up to 1,400 people killed in crackdowns as she clung to power.\n\nThe interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner  Muhammad Yunus  has pledged to hold elections in February but has banned the Awami League under amendments to the antiterrorism act, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into the party’s senior leaders.\n\n“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,”  Hasina  said in emailed comments to the Reuters news agency published on Wednesday.\n\n“Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.”\n\nThe Awami League and the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have long dominated the politics of Bangladesh, which has more than 126 million registered voters. The elections in January 2024 were boycotted by the BNP as its top leaders were either jailed or in exile.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned the ban on the Awami League as “draconian”. In the party’s absence, the BNP is predicted to lead in next year’s election while Jamaat-e-Islami, the Muslim-majority country’s largest Islamist party, is rising in popularity.\n\n“We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina told Reuters of the upcoming elections. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.”\n\nThe International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, and a verdict is expected on November 13.\n\nChief Prosecutor Tajul Islam accused Hasina of being “the nucleus around whom all the crimes were committed” during the uprising and called for the death penalty if she is found guilty.\n\nProsecutors also alleged she oversaw disappearances and torture of opposition activists at clandestine detention centres run by security agencies.\n\nHasina has defied court orders to return to attend the trial. She told Reuters the proceedings were “a politically motivated charade”.\n\n“They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion.”\n\nIn an emailed interview with the AFP news agency also published on Wednesday, Hasina called charges that she had ordered security forces to fire on protesters as “bogus” and said she “mourned all the lives lost during the terrible days” of her crackdown.\n\nThe prosecution, which insisted her trial was fair, has played audiotapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters.\n\nThis month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the International Criminal Court in The Hague investigate reported “retaliatory violence”, including allegations of “beatings and lynchings”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by four environmental nonprofits—Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies—reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects have been launched globally between 2021 and 2024.

bomb’ projects since 2021\n\nTwenty-eight new “carbon bomb” projects have launched across the globe over the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/29/live-israel-kills-63-in-gaza-trump-insists-nothing-will-jeopardise-truce","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Death toll from Israeli attacks on Gaza rises to 104, testing fragile truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza has risen to 104, including at least 35 children, following a deadly air strike on a residential area in Gaza City that trapped civilians under rubble.

Washington-brokered ceasefire  in Gaza is holding, despite Israeli forces killing more than 100 Palestinians, including 46 children.\n\nIn about 12 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday, Israeli attacks on  Gaza  killed at least 104 Palestinians and wounded 253 others, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\n\n“These documented crimes add to the long list of ongoing violations against our people,” the Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza said in a statement, demanding an “immediate and comprehensive ceasefire” across the Strip.\n\nOne of the latest attacks hit a tent housing displaced people in Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera. Other attacks targeted the northern and southern parts of the enclave.\n\nThe US president defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, citing reports that a 37-year-old Israeli soldier had been killed in southern Gaza. A brief statement from the Israeli military did not specify when the soldier was killed but said his family had been notified before the information was released.\n\n“As I understand it, they took out an Israeli soldier,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One as he travelled from Japan to  South Korea , saying he heard the soldier was apparently killed by sniper fire. “So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back. When that happens, they should hit back,” he added, calling Israel’s attacks “retribution” for the soldier’s death.\n\nHamas has denied responsibility for the alleged attack on Israeli forces in Rafah, southern Gaza, and said in a statement that it remained committed to the ceasefire deal.\n\n“Nothing is going to jeopardise” the ceasefire, the US president affirmed.\n\n“You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave,” he said.\n\n“If they [Hamas] are good, they are going to be happy and if they are not good, they are going to be terminated; their lives will be terminated.”\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had reinstated the Gaza ceasefire after carrying out a series of strikes on dozens of “terror targets”, including “30 terrorists holding command positions”. It did not provide any evidence to back up these claims.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said the renewed attacks had plunged Palestinians into a state of “panic”.\n\n“As of this morning, we see that a brief hope for calm has turned into despair. The skies are filled with fighter jets, drones and reconnaissance aircraft,” he said on Wednesday.\n\n“And the fear now is that what started last night is going to continue for days to come.”\n\nSave the Children called reports of children being killed along with their families “excruciating.”\n\n“This cannot become the new normal under a ceasefire,” Ahmad Alhendawi, Save the Children’s Regional Director for the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, said in a statement. “A lasting ceasefire must mean safety, relief, and recovery for children not continued suffering. It must be fully respected and upheld.”\n\n“We are pleading: stop this now. Protect the ceasefire, protect children, and give Gaza’s families a step towards the genuine peace they have been waiting for,” Alhendawi added.\n\nMouin Rabbani, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies, told Al Jazeera that Israel had “never really fulfilled any of its commitments” under the deal, including withdrawing to the agreed line in Gaza or allowing the agreed-upon amount of aid to enter Gaza.\n\nAccording to Rabbani, Israel is deliberately trying to undermine a ceasefire deal it was unwillingly dragged into by the US. He said it is evident “Israel does not feel it is simply able to unilaterally renounce” the ceasefire, “so what we’re seeing is a gradual intensification of the process of erosion”.\n\n“The key issue here now is how will the United States … respond,” he added.\n\nFor Rob Geist Pinfold, a lecturer in international security at King’s College London, the ceasefire has been fragile “from day one” as both Israel and Hamas agreed the deal under significant duress from the US.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that as Israel still controls some 50 percent of the Strip, “it’s understandable why to many Palestinians in Gaza this might not look like an actual ceasefire and definitely not a peace plan and more an indefinite, prolonged occupation with no end in sight”.\n\nOn the ground between Hamas and Israel, Pinfold said there is a “game of chicken where both sides are trying to test each other’s limits, test each other’s boundaries”.\n\n“The fact that a soldier was killed in Rafah – we still don’t know by whom, we still don’t know if this was ordered by Hamas or this was somebody else,” he said. But what the incident did was “allow Israel to seize this opportunity to violate the ceasefire because this is what they wanted all along”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/record-rains-and-floods-in-vietnam-leave-at-least-nine-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:04:37+00:00","title":"Nine people killed as record rains and floods lash Vietnam","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam—exceeding 1,000mm in 24 hours—has triggered catastrophic flooding, killing at least nine people and injuring 11.

States at risk of losing access to the federal  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (SNAP) – also known as food stamps – from November 1, a viral chart has claimed to show the majority of the nation’s food stamp recipients are non-white and noncitizens.\n\nThe chart, titled Food Stamps by Ethnicity, listed 36 groups of people and said it showed the “percentage of US households receiving SNAP benefits”.\n\nThe groups were labelled by nationality, such as “Afghan”, “Somali”, “Iraqi”, along with the racial groups “white”, “Black” and “native”. The chart appeared to show that Afghan people were the largest group receiving SNAP benefits, at 45.6 percent, followed by Somali (42.4 percent) and Iraqi (34.8 percent). White people, represented on the chart with the US flag, were third to last at 8.6 percent.\n\nThe federal  government shutdown , which started on October 1, is the cause of the looming SNAP funding lapse. SNAP provides food purchasing benefits to low-income households. Conservatives have peddled the misleading narrative that Democrats are pushing for healthcare for undocumented migrants, and people commenting on the chart rehashed a similar talking point.\n\n“Who is getting their EBT cut?” read the caption of an October 25 X post sharing the chart, which had 3.1 million views as of October 27. EBT stands for Electronic Benefits Transfer, which is a SNAP payment system.\n\n“Only 18.7% of EBT or food stamp recipients are American. Let that sink in …” read another post sharing the chart, seemingly mistakenly referring to the figure next to the word “Armenian”; there was no “American” category in the chart. “We are subsidizing foreigners on the taxpayers dime.”\n\nWho is getting their EBT cut  pic.twitter.com/el8x9X5iVX\n\n— The General (@1776General_)  October 25, 2025\n\nThe chart doesn’t show the full picture of SNAP recipients by race or ethnicity. The most reliable source for the breakdown of SNAP recipients by demographics comes from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the programme.\n\nAccording to the most recent USDA data available, from 2023, white people are the largest racial group receiving SNAP benefits, at 35.4 percent. African Americans are next, making up 25.7 percent of recipients, then Hispanic people at 15.6 percent, Asian people at 3.9 percent, Native Americans at 1.3 percent and multiracial people at 1 percent. The race of 17 percent of participants is unknown.\n\nThe same report found that 89.4 percent of SNAP recipients were US-born citizens, meaning less than 11 percent of SNAP participants were foreign-born. Of the latter figure, 6.2 percent were naturalised citizens, 1.1 percent were refugees and 3.3 percent were other noncitizens, including lawful permanent residents and other eligible noncitizens.\n\nWhile large shares of the groups listed in the chart may receive food stamps, “they are certainly a tiny share of the households and spending on SNAP”, said Tracy Roof, University of Richmond associate professor of political science.\n\nThe chart shared on social media originated from a June blog post from The Personal Finance Wizards, which cited “US Census Table S0201” as its source. The site offers financial advice, but published a disclaimer saying it cannot guarantee the “completeness, accuracy, or reliability” of its information.\n\nThe site’s authors appeared to cherry-pick groups to include in the chart, noting, “It’s important to note that the graph highlights a selection of ethnicities we felt would be most relevant and engaging for our audience.” It did not name an author.\n\nIn a comment on an Instagram post sharing the chart, Personal Finance Wizards shared a link to the US Census table it used. It shows data from the 2024 American Community Survey, filtered by 49 racial and ethnic groups. The filtered groups don’t completely overlap with the groups in the chart, but the dataset has a column for “households with food stamp/SNAP benefits”, which shows percentages similar to the ones in the chart.\n\nThe data does not show what percentage of all SNAP beneficiaries belong to an ethnic or nationality group.\n\nJoseph Llobrera, senior director of research for the food assistance team at the liberal think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the chart appeared to show the shares of households receiving SNAP based on the household respondents’ reported ancestry, which is different from citizenship status.\n\n“Without context, this graphic is misleading and may lead some to conclude that many non-citizens are participating in SNAP, which is not true,” he said.\n\nThe American Community Survey allows respondents to self-identify their race. It also defines ancestry as a “person’s ethnic origin or descent, roots or heritage, place of birth, or place of parents’ ancestors before their arrival in the United States”.\n\nColleen Heflin, Syracuse University expert on food insecurity, nutrition and welfare policy, said the American Community Survey data on SNAP receipts is self-reported, and that question “is known to have a great deal of measurement error” when compared with SNAP administrative data.\n\nGroups such as Afghans and Iraqis, who are first and third on the chart, would have been more likely to have immediately qualified for the SNAP programme before the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ’s passage because of their special immigration status.\n\nBefore the law’s passage, refugees and people who had been granted asylum were also eligible for SNAP without a waiting period. Somalis, who were second on the chart, are “more likely” to qualify based on those criteria, Roof said.\n\nOther noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents, could be eligible for SNAP only after a five-year waiting period.\n\nBut the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed the eligibility, making refugees and asylum seekers ineligible. Immigrants in the country illegally are not and have never been eligible for SNAP."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Jamaica declares disaster as ‘Monstrous Melissa’ ravages island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica upon landfall, causing widespread destruction to homes, hospitals, roads, and critical infrastructure, particularly in the agricultural heartland of St Elizabeth.

area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the Caribbean island as one of the most powerful storms on record, leaving behind a trail of devastation.\n\nThe hurricane – which made landfall as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday – ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated the nation’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, dropping it down to a Category 3 storm, before it ramped back up as it  continued  on Wednesday towards Cuba.\n\nHolness said in a series of posts on X that the storm has “ravaged” his country and the disaster declaration gives his government “tools to continue managing” its response to the storm.\n\n“It is clear that where the eye of the hurricane hit, there would be devastating impact,” he told the United States news channel CNN late on Tuesday. “Reports we have had so far include damage to hospitals, significant damage to residential property, housing and commercial property as well, and damage to our road infrastructure.”\n\nHolness said he does not have any confirmed reports of deaths at the moment. “But with a Category 5 hurricane, … we are expecting some loss of life,” he added.\n\nThe prime minister said his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nDesmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s local government minister, told reporters on Tuesday evening that the storm had caused damage across almost every parish in the country and left most of the island without electricity.\n\nHe said the storm had put the parish of St Elizabeth, the country’s main agricultural region, “under water”.\n\n“The damage to St Elizabeth is extensive, based on what we have seen,” the minister said, adding that “almost every parish is experiencing blocked roads, fallen trees and utility poles, and excess flooding in many communities.”\n\n“Work is presently on the way to restore our service, to give priorities to the critical facilities, such as hospitals and water and pumping stations,” he added.\n\nThe storm caused “significant damage” to at least four

A hurricane watch was in effect for Bermuda.\n\nThe storm was expected to generate a storm surge of up to 3.6 metres (12ft) in the region and drop up to 51cm (20 inches) of rain in parts of eastern Cuba.\n\n“There will be a lot of work to do. We know there will be a lot of damage,” President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a televised address in which he assured that “no one is left behind and no resources are spared to protect the lives of the population”.\n\nAt the same time, he urged Cubans not to underestimate the power of Hurricane Melissa, “the strongest ever to hit national territory”.\n\nAlthough Jamaica and Cuba are used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making the storms more severe.\n\nBritish-Jamaican climate change activist and author Mikaela Loach said in a video shared on social media that Melissa “gained energy from the extremely and unnaturally  hot seas  in the Caribbean”.\n\n“These sea temperatures are not natural,” Loach said. “They’re extremely hot because of the gasses that have resulted from burning fossil fuels.”\n\n“Countries like Jamaica, countries that are most vulnerable to climate disaster are also countries that have had their wealth and resources stripped away from them through colonial bondage,” Loach added.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting to the effects of a warming world.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 5 storm with sustained winds over 250km/h, is threatening Jamaica with catastrophic flooding, landslides, and storm surges due to its slow movement at just 7km/h.

2025-10-27T06:45:50+00:00\n\nTitle: Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/29/live-israel-kills-63-in-gaza-trump-insists-nothing-will-jeopardise-truce?update=4068853","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Death toll from Israeli attacks on Gaza rises to 104, testing fragile truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza has climbed to 104, including at least 35 children killed in a residential area of Gaza City during an air strike that trapped civilians under rubble.

‘Horrific violations’: Arab nations slam RSF killings in Sudan’s el-Fasher\n\nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Jordan have condemned the abuses committed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) during their capture of the city of el-Fasher in Sudan, as more evidence emerged of mass killings in the strategic area.\n\nThe denunciations on Tuesday came as researchers at Yale University said satellite imagery of el-Fasher, taken after the RSF moved in, shows clusters of objects consistent with the size of human bodies, as well as large areas of red discolouration on the ground.\n\nThe RSF has been locked in a bloody civil war with Sudan’s army since 2023, in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 12 million people.\n\nThe paramilitary force overran el-Fasher, the army’s last stronghold in Darfur, on Sunday after 17 months of siege.\n\nThe Sudanese government said that at least 2,000 people have been killed in the city since then, while aid agencies say they have received credible reports of atrocities, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes and house-to-house raids.\n\nSexual violence, particularly against women and girls, was also reported in the city, they said.\n\nEl-Fasher’s fall puts the RSF in near full control of the vast region of Darfur and has raised concerns of another split of Sudan, more than a decade after South Sudan’s creation.\n\nThe developments have alarmed regional governments.\n\nSaudi Arabia, in a statement on Tuesday, expressed “deep concern and condemnation of the grave human rights violations” and called on the RSF to fulfil their responsibility to protect Sudanese civilians.\n\nEgypt, which shares a border with Sudan, called for all “possible measures to be taken to achieve an immediate humanitarian truce across Sudan”, while also reaffirming its continued commitment to “providing all possible support to help” the neighbouring country overcome its current crisis.\n\nTurkiye called for the immediate cessation of hostilities in el-Fasher, while also urging “safe passage, the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and an end to attacks on innocent civilians”, according to the Anadolu news agency.\n\nIt also condemned the “atrocities committed against civilians in el-Fasher” and “highlighted the importance of dialogue to find a peaceful solution to the conflict”.\n\nQatar, too, condemned the “horrific violations” in el-Fasher and called for dialogue to resolve the crisis.\n\nEgypt, Turkiye and Qatar all reiterated their “firm support for the unity, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sudan”, with Cairo saying it rejected “any attempts to divide the country or undermine its unity and territorial cohesion”.\n\nJordan joined the chorus of concern, saying in a statement that it condemned the violations against civilians and stressed the “urgent need to exercise restraint and implement a ceasefire to safeguard civilian lives”.\n\nThe RSF has not addressed the allegations against it.\n\nThe paramilitary force grew out of the notorious government-backed/linked militia known as the Janjaweed, which carried out genocide during the Darfur conflict in the 2000s. The US has also declared that the RSF and its allies have committed genocide in the current war.\n\nIn comments in Malaysia on Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the fall of el-Fasher marked a “terrible escalation” in the war and called for a cessation of foreign military support to the warring parties.\n\n“The problem is not only the fighting between the army and the Rapid Support Forces, but also the growing external interference that undermines prospects for a ceasefire and a political solution,” he was quoted as saying by a UN spokesman.\n\nGuterres did not name a specific country, but the Sudanese government and rights groups have repeatedly accused the United Arab Emirates of being involved in the war by supplying the RSF with weapons, a claim the Gulf country has denied.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, the Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab published a report relying on satellite imagery that said that RSF forces were “conducting alleged mass killings” after seizing el-Fasher.\n\nUsing imagery from Airbus taken on Monday, the lab pointed out a series of scenes in el-Fasher’s Daraja Oula neighbourhood.\n\nThey included what appeared to be gun-mounted trucks, known as “technicals”, in the streets in formations that appeared like roadblocks.\n\n“Imagery analysis shows objects consistent with the size of human bodies on the ground near RSF vehicles, including at least five instances of reddish earth discoloration,” the report said.\n\nNathaniel Raymond, the executive director of Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab, described the violence in el-Fasher as unprecedented.\n\n“The scale is immense, from the earthen berm, the wall that now surrounds el-Fasher, to specific neighbourhoods, such as Daraja Oula, to hospitals and humanitarian facilities. We are seeing objects that measure between 1.5 to 2 metres [5 to 6.5 feet], which is the standard length of a human body, lying horizontal, as seen in satellite imagery at high resolution,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Those objects were not there 36 to 48 hours ago. They now litter the city.”\n\nRaymond said the atrocities did not come as a surprise.\n\n“This campaign of mass killing that we are seeing now in el-Fasher has been warned about in excruciating detail by both the Humanitarian Research Lab and many other colleague organisations, especially the local response community, in Darfur for months,” he said.\n\nThe researcher warned that the killings were a preview of what could happen in other areas of Darfur and the North Kordofan province as RSF forces move to the east of the country with the fall of el-Fasher.\n\nThe Humanitarian Research Lab, in its report, added that the actions of the RSF “may be consistent with war crimes and crimes against humanity (CAH) and may rise to the level of genocide”.\n\n“The world must act immediately to put the maximum amount of pressure on the RSF and its backers, specifically the UAE, to end the killing now,” it added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/29/live-israel-kills-63-in-gaza-trump-insists-nothing-will-jeopardise-truce?update=4068798","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Death toll from Israeli attacks on Gaza rises to 104, testing fragile truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The death toll from Israeli military attacks in Gaza has reached 104, including at least 35 children, following an air strike on a residential area in Gaza City that killed civilians and trapped them under rubble.

for a new president, as well as members of parliament and councillors, in elections which are expected to continue the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) – or Party of Revolution’s – 64-year-long grip on power.\n\nDespite a bevy of candidates in the lineup, incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan, analysts say, is virtually unchallenged and will almost certainly win, following what rights groups say has been a heavy crackdown on popular opposition members, activists and journalists.\n\nKey challengers  Tundu Lissu  of the largest opposition party, Chadema, and Luhaga Mpina of ACT-Wazalendo, have been  barred  from standing, thus eliminating any real threat to Hassan. Other presidential candidates on the ballot lack political backing and are unlikely to make much impact on voters, analysts say.\n\nThe  East African nation  is replete with rolling savannas and wildlife, making it a hotspot for safari tourism. It is also home to Africa’s tallest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro, as well as a host of important landmarks, like the Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti. Precious minerals, such as the unique tanzanite – a blue gemstone – and gold, as well as agricultural exports, contribute significantly to foreign earnings.\n\nCentral Dodoma is the country’s capital, while the economic hub is coastal Dar-es-Salaam. Swahili is the lingua franca, while different local groups speak several other languages.\n\nHere’s what to expect at the polls:\n\nVoters are choosing a president, parliament members and local councillors for the 29 regions in mainland Tanzania. A president and parliament members will also be elected in the autonomous island of Zanzibar.\n\nWinners are elected by plurality or simple majority vote – the candidate with the most votes wins.\n\nAuthorities declared that Wednesday would be a public holiday to allow people to vote, while early voting began in Zanzibar on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 37 million of the 60 million population are registered to vote. To vote, you must be a citizen aged 18 or over.\n\nVoter turnout in the last general elections in 2020 was just 50.72 percent, however, according to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems.\n\nFormerly the country’s vice president, Hassan, 65, automatically ascended to the position of president following the death of former President John Magufuli in March 2021, to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\nHassan is presently one of only two African female leaders, the other being Namibia’s Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. She is the sixth president and the first female leader of her country. She was previously minister of trade for Zanzibar, where she is from.\n\nThis will be Hassan’s first attempt at the ballot, and the election was supposed to be a test of how Tanzanians view her leadership so far. However, analysts say the fact that her two strongest challengers have been barred from the polls means the president is running with virtually no competition.\n\nAfter taking office in 2021, Hassan immediately began reversing controversial policies implemented by  Magafuli , an isolationist leader who denied that COVID-19 existed and refused to issue policies regarding quarantines or vaccines.\n\nUnder Hassan, Tanzania joined the international COVAX facility, directed by institutions like the World Health Organization, to help distribute vaccines to developing countries, especially in Africa.\n\nHassan also struck a reconciliatory tone with opposition leaders by lifting a six-year ban on political rallies imposed by Magufuli.\n\nShe focused on completing large-scale Magafuli-era development projects and launched new ones, especially around railway infrastructure and rural electrification. The president’s supporters, therefore, praise her record in infrastructure development, improving access to education and improving overall stability of governance in the country.\n\nHowever, while many hoped Tanzania would become more democratic under her leadership, Hassan’s style of governance has become increasingly authoritarian, analysts say, and now more closely resembles that of her predecessor.\n\nIn a report ahead of the elections, Amnesty International found that Hassan’s government has intensified “repressive practices” and has targeted opposition leaders, civil society activists and groups, journalists and other dissenting voices with forced disappearances, arrests, harassment and even torture.\n\nTanzania’s government has consistently denied all accusations of human rights violations.\n\nHassan’s campaign rallies have been highly visible across the country – but hers has been nearly the only major national campaign, with smaller parties sticking to their particular regions.\n\nSome opposition parties are now calling for a boycott of the elections altogether. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Chadema party member John Kitoka, who is currently in hiding to avoid arrest, said the elections are “completely a sham”.\n\nLast week, Hassan urged Tanzanians to ignore calls to boycott the vote and warned against protests.\n\n“The only demonstrations that will exist are those of people going to the polling stations to vote. There will be no other demonstrations. There will be no security threat,” she said.\n\nTanzania’s police have also warned against creating or distributing “inciting” content on social media, threatening that those caught will face prosecution. The country routinely restricts access to social media on specific occasions, such as during protests. Only select traditional media have been approved to provide coverage of the elections.\n\nIn the autonomous Zanzibar, which will also elect a president and parliament members, there is more of an atmosphere of competitive elections, observers say. Incumbent leader Hussein Mwinyi of the ruling CCM is facing off against the ACT-Wazalendo candidate Othman Masoud, who has been serving as his vice president in a coalition government.\n\nTundu Lissu, 57, is the charismatic and widely popular opposition Chadema candidate who lived in exile in Belgium for several years during the Magufuli era. His party, which calls for free elections, reduction of presidential powers, and promotion of human rights, has been barred from the vote for failing to meet a submission deadline, and Lissu is currently in custody for alleged “treasonous” remarks he made ahead of the elections.\n\nThe move followed Lissu’s comments during a Chadema rally in the southern town of Mbinga on April 3, during which he urged his supporters to boycott the elections if Hassan’s government did not institute electoral reforms before the vote. Lissu was calling on the government to change the makeup of the Independent National Election Commission, arguing that the agency should not include people appointed directly by Hassan.\n\nGovernment officials claimed his statements were “inciting” and arrested Lissu on April 9.\n\nThree days later, the electoral commission disqualified Chadema from this election – and all others until 2030 – on the grounds that the party had failed to sign a mandatory Electoral Code of Conduct due on April 12.\n\nLocal media reported that two Chadema party members attending a rally in support of Lissu on April 24 were also arrested by the Tanzanian police.\n\nLast week, Chadema deputy chairperson John Heche, deputy chairperson of Chadema, was detained while attempting to attend Lissu’s trial at the Dar-es-Salaam High Court. He has not been seen since.\n\nLissu has been detained often. He survived an assassination attempt in 2017 after he was shot 16 times.\n\nIn August, the elections commission also barred opposition candidate Luhaga Mpina, 50, of the ACT-Wazalendo, the second-largest opposition party. Mpina, a parliament member who broke away from the ruling CCM in August to join ACT-Wazalendo – also known as the Alliance for Change and Transparency – was barred for allegedly failing to follow the rules for nominations during the presidential primaries.\n\nHassan will compete with 16 other candidates –  none of whom are from major national parties or have an established political presence.\n\nObservers say Tanzania’s democracy, already fragile during the presidency of Magafuli, is at risk as a result of the Hassan government’s tightening of political freedoms and crackdowns on the media.\n\nAmnesty International notes that electoral rights violations were apparent in 2020 under  Magufuli , but have worsened ahead of this week’s polls.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and the United Nations human rights agency (UNHCR) have similarly documented reports of rights violations under Hassan’s government, noting in particular the disappearance of two regional activists, Boniface Mwangi from Kenya and Agather Atuhaire from Uganda, who travelled to witness Lissu’s trial but were detained in Dar-es-Salaam on May 19, 2025.\n\nMwangi was reportedly tortured and dumped in a coastal Kenyan town, while Atuhaire reported being sexually assaulted before also being abandoned at the border with Uganda.\n\n“More than 200 cases of enforced disappearance have been recorded in Tanzania since 2019,” the UNHCR noted.\n\nTanzania’s economic growth has been stable with inflation staying below the Central Bank’s 5 percent target in recent years, according to the World Bank.\n\nUnlike its neighbour, Kenya, the lower-middle-income country has avoided debt distress, with GDP boosted by high demand for its gold, tourism and agricultural commodities like cashew nuts, coffee and cotton. However, the World Bank noted that 49 percent of the population lives below the international poverty line.\n\nWhile growth has attracted foreign investment, government policies have negatively impacted the business landscape: In July, Hassan’s government introduced new restrictions banning foreigners from owning and operating businesses in 15 sectors, including mobile money transfers, tour guiding, small-scale mining and on-farm crop buying.\n\nOfficials argued that too many foreigners were engaging in informal businesses that ought to benefit Tanzanians. The move played to recent protests against the rising influx of Chinese products and businesses in Tanzanian markets, analysts say. Foreigners are also banned from owning beauty salons, souvenir shops and radio and TV stations.\n\nThe move proved controversial in the regional East African Community bloc, particularly in neighbouring Kenya, whose citizens make up a significant population of business owners in the country, having taken advantage of the free-movement policy within the bloc.\n\nWhile abundant wildlife and natural resources have boosted the economy via tourism, Tanzania faces major challenges in managing human-wildlife conflict.\n\nClashes between humans, particularly in rural areas, and wild animals are becoming more common due to population growth and climate change, which is pushing animals closer to human settlements in search of food and water.\n\nHuman-elephant flare-ups are most common. Between 2012 and 2019, more than 1,000 human-wildlife mortality cases were reported nationwide, according to data from Queen’s University, Canada.\n\nWhile the government provides financial and material compensation to the families of those affected by human-wildlife conflict incidents, families often complain of receiving funds late.\n\nMeanwhile, there is  tension  between the government and indigenous groups such as the Maasai, who are resisting being evicted to make more room for conservation space to be used for tourism.\n\nLast year, crackdowns on Maasai protesters and resulting outrage from groups led to the World Bank suspending a $150m conservation grant, and the European Union cancelling Tanzania’s eligibility for a separate $20m grant."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2910-02-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wide range of science and technology issues are being discussed in the article, including Delhi’s use of cloud seeding to combat pollution, Amazon Web Services’ massive cloud outage, growing fears over AI spreading misinformation and enabling price discrimination in retail, policy changes in EV incentives under President Trump’s tax bill, environmental concerns over forever chemicals, and the IMF’s view that an AI bubble collapse would not cause systemic financial damage.

without the leading opposition party, as the government of Samia Suluhu Hassan has been cracking down on dissent ahead of the vote.\n\nMore than 37 million registered voters are casting their ballots from 7am local time (4:00 GMT) until 4pm (13:00 GMT). The election commission says it will announce the results within three days of election day.\n\nInternet connectivity was disrupted across Tanzania as voting got under way, according to users in the country. Netblocks, an internet access advocacy group, confirmed the outage, saying on X that “live network data show a nationwide disruption to internet connectivity”.\n\nPresident Hassan, 65, is expected to win after  candidates  from the two leading opposition parties were barred from standing in an election marked by concerns from human rights groups.\n\nThe leader of Tanzania’s main opposition party, Chadema’s Tundu Lissu, is  on trial for treason , charges he denies. The electoral commission disqualified Chadema in April after it refused to sign an electoral code of conduct.\n\nThe commission also disqualified Luhaga Mpina, the candidate for the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, after an objection from the attorney general, leaving only candidates from minor parties taking on Hassan.\n\nIn addition to the presidential election, voters will choose members of the country’s 400-seat parliament and a president and politicians in the semiautonomous Zanzibar archipelago.\n\nHassan’s governing party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), whose predecessor party led the struggle for independence for mainland Tanzania in the 1950s, has dominated national politics since its founding in 1977.\n\nHassan, one of just two female heads of state in Africa, won plaudits after coming to power in 2021 for easing repression of political opponents and censorship that proliferated under her predecessor, John Magufuli, who died in office.\n\nBut in the last two years, rights campaigners and opposition candidates have accused the government of unexplained abductions of its critics.\n\nShe maintains her government is committed to respecting human rights and last year ordered an investigation into the reports of abductions. No official findings have been made public.\n\nUN human rights experts have called on Hassan’s government to immediately stop the enforced disappearance of political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists “as a tool of repression in the electoral context”.\n\nThey said more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance had been recorded in Tanzania since 2019.\n\nA recent Amnesty International report detailed a “wave of terror” including “enforced disappearance and torture … and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures and activists”.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said “the authorities have suppressed the political opposition and critics of the ruling party, stifled the media, and failed to ensure the electoral commission’s independence”.\n\nUS crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) said the ruling CCM was intent on maintaining its status as the “last hegemonic liberation party in southern Africa” and avoiding the recent electoral pressures faced by counterparts in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n\nIn September 2024, the body of  Ali Mohamed Kibao , a member of the secretariat of the opposition Chadema party, was found after two armed men forced him off a bus heading from Dar-es-Salaam to the northeastern port city of Tanga.\n\nThere are fears that even members of CCM are being targeted. Humphrey Polepole, a former CCM spokesman and ambassador to Cuba, went missing from his home this month after resigning and criticising Hassan. His family found blood stains in his home.\n\nThe Tanganyika Law Society says it has confirmed 83 abductions since Hassan came to power, with another 20 reported in recent weeks.\n\nProtests are rare in Tanzania, in part thanks to a relatively healthy economy, which grew by 5.5 percent last year, according to the World Bank, on the back of strong agriculture, tourism and mining sectors.\n\nHassan has promised big infrastructure projects and universal health insurance in a bid to win over voters."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62eww646wjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:18:38.832+00:00","title":"Woman dies after being left behind by cruise ship on Australian island","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An 80-year-old Australian woman died on Lizard Island, part of the Great Barrier Reef, after being left behind during a group hiking excursion on the Coral Adventurer cruise ship.

The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nProf Mircea Raianu of the University of Maryland who's written a seminal history of the corporation, views the tussle as a \"resurfacing of unresolved business\" - or the core question of who runs the show at Tata, and how much control majority shareholders (the philanthropic arm Tata Trusts which owns 66% of the parent company, Tata Sons) can wield in making business decisions.\n\nThe Tata Group is uniquely structured, with controlling shares of the unlisted commercial holding company (Tata Sons) vested in a philanthropic organisation (Tata Trusts). While this has given the group tax and regulatory advantages, and allows it to carry out charitable activities, experts say it has also led to governance issues given its dual non-profit and commercial objectives.\n\nThe latest rift comes at a time when the Tatas are facing severe business headwinds while trying to expand into new growth areas like semiconductors and electric vehicles, as well as attempting to revive Air India -  the ailing carrier they bought from the government in 2021 - following a tragic  crash  earlier this year.\n\nSo, what's gone wrong?\n\nThe Tatas have not publicly commented on the discord, but it is widely reported to stem from differences among trustees over board nominations, funding approvals and the public listing of Tata Sons - the holding company of 26 publicly listed Tata firms with a market capitalisation of some $328bn.\n\nA source close to the Tata Group told the BBC on condition of anonymity that some of the trustees' desire for greater influence in making strategic decisions at Tata Sons and picking nominees on its board is at the centre of the tussle. Tata Trusts has three nominees on the Tata Sons board.\n\n\"The Tata Trusts nominees have a veto right in major company decisions, but it is understood that theirs is basically a supervisory role, not an assertive one,\" said the source. \"However now, some of the trustees want more power to make commercial decisions.\"\n\nAnother more significant point of contention is the desire of the SP Group - the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, with an 18% stake - to take the company public. While the former has been pushing hard for it, most Tata trustees are against the idea.\n\n\"There is fear that going public would dilute the trust's decision-making capacity and long-term focus and expose Tata Sons to quarterly market pressures,\" said the source. \"This is especially because there are so many new businesses at a very nascent stage.\"\n\nBut the SP Group has called its prospective public listing a \"moral and social imperative\" that would unlock value for Tata shareholders and improve transparency and governance at the company.\n\nNeither Tata Sons not Tata Trusts have responded to detailed questions from the BBC. But according to Prof Raianu, the tussle highlights a very real dilemma for the group.\n\nA public listing, he says, would be counter to what many giant conglomerates in the United States and Europe are increasingly doing - \"opting for foundation ownership to promote stability and sustainability\", ironically, by looking to the Tatas as an example.\n\n\"But at the same time, private or closely held companies are indeed subject to less outside scrutiny, which can fuel conflict and harm reputation,\" Prof Raianu adds.\n\nThe conflict has already raised governance concerns and hit the brand image of what is arguably one of India's oldest and most revered business houses, says publicist Dilip Cherian, who once worked closely with former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry.\n\n\"This just adds to the series of blows the Tata image has taken recently,\" Mr Cherian told the BBC, referring to the devastating Air India crash earlier this year and the cyber-attack on a key unit of JLR which plunged the UK's car production to a  70-year-low   this September.\n\nFurther, TCS, the flagship software outsourcing company that contributes to nearly half the group's revenues, has been plagued with its own set of challenges, including  mass layoffs  and the recent ending of a contract by retailer Marks & Spencer.\n\n\"These boardroom battles create further confusion. There will not only be anxiety about share performance, but questions among investors about who exactly they are dealing with at the Tatas,\" said Mr Cherian.\n\nAmid this turmoil, the tenure of N Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Tata Sons, has reportedly been extended.\n\n\"The chairman can continue doing his work, since this is not a rift within the board, but between the trustees. But it is an unnecessary distraction for him,\" the source close to Tata Sons said.\n\nBut the Tatas are not new to firefighting crises. The group saw fierce battles in the 90s after Ratan Tata took over the group and attempted to modernise its operating structure. The conflict that broke out after Mistry's ouster a few years ago is still fresh in many people's memory.\n\nThere is however, a major difference this time, says Prof Raianu.\n\n\"Underperforming companies at the time were held afloat by TCS, which facilitated continuity. Before TCS, this role was played by Tata Steel.\"\n\nRight now - with TCS's business model in a flux and its contribution to overall Tata group revenues coming under pressure - a similar \"anchor\" to the group is yet to emerge, making it harder for the group to fight such internal divisions.\n\n\"It is obviously destabilising and potentially destructive in the short term, but it is possible that a new and more transparent and accountable structure can emerge when the dust settles,\" says Prof Raianu.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/29/no-stability-no-safety-life-inside-gazas-crowded-tents","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:36:13+00:00","title":"'No stability, no safety': Life inside Gaza’s crowded tents","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Palestinians in Gaza are living in overcrowded, unsanitary tent camps with no access to clean water, sanitation, food, or medicine, as Israel continues military operations despite a fragile ceasefire.

Life inside Gaza’s crowded tents\n\nMillions of Palestinians remain crammed into overcrowded tents, packed schools and other buildings, or sleeping on the streets of Gaza, as Israel continues its genocidal war on the enclave despite a fragile ceasefire.\n\nOvercrowding, poor sanitation, a lack of food and a shortage of medicine have turned Gaza’s makeshift shelters into a breeding ground for infectious diseases.\n\n“Even the minimum standards of human dignity and hygiene cannot be maintained under these conditions,” Samaher Saeed, Medical Aid for Palestine’s (MAP) protection manager in Gaza, tells Al Jazeera from southern Gaza.\n\n“There's no stability, no safety,” Saeed adds, capturing the daily reality faced by displaced Palestinians.\n\nTo understand just what living conditions are like in a tent in Gaza, Al Jazeera visited a camp in Deir el-Balah, the governorate with the highest number of active shelters.\n\nThe living space is divided into outdoor and indoor areas. The outdoor section serves multiple daily needs, including cooking meals over an open fire, washing dishes, hanging clothes and using the outdoor toilet, while the indoor area is primarily for sleeping and shelter from the sun or rain.\n\nThe tent’s shaded area measures 20 sqm (215sq ft) and is shared by an average of 10 people, giving each just 2sqm (22sq ft) of personal space, well below the UNHCR’s recommended minimum of 3.5sqm per person and 2 metres (6.5ft) height for proper ventilation.\n\nThe tent itself is built from old blankets and fabric scraps, with sheets of nylon held up with ropes and supported by metal and wooden poles. These materials offer minimal protection from rain, do little to ensure privacy, and fail to regulate temperatures during cold winters and hot summers.\n\n“The tents that were set up early in the war have completely deteriorated after two years of use; they no longer protect people from shrapnel, the summer heat or the winter cold,” says Saeed.\n\nEarlier  reporting by Al Jazeera in Gaza  describes a mother speaking of “a summer that has ravaged children’s bodies” and being “eaten by flies and insects” where the “tent environment is very miserable”.\n\nIn the corners of the tent, personal belongings are stored in sacks and cardboard boxes, while clothes are hung up to maximise space, allowing them to be quickly packed in the face of Israel’s constant forced expulsion orders and incessant bombings.\n\nKitchen utensils, pots and pans are tucked away in another corner of the outdoor living space, while plastic containers store precious drinking water.\n\nJust outside, an open fire is used for cooking, but it sits next to piles of rubbish, including cardboard and other materials to be used as fuel, releasing harmful smoke into the air and creating health risks.\n\nHundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish have built up near camps.\n\nIsrael has restricted access to Gaza's two main landfills, at Juhor ad-Dik in the north and al-Fukhari (also known as Sofa) in the south, where this rubbish would normally be taken.\n\nAs of February 2025, the continued denial of access to the Sofa landfill, located in the no-go zone, is preventing the transfer of solid waste from the 30 temporary dump sites and numerous persistent ad hoc sites.\n\n“We often find ourselves in situations where we know that people are living in dangerous or undignified environments near sewage, waste dumps or unsafe shelters, but we simply have no alternative to offer them,” Saeed says.\n\nSleeping arrangements are rough; the best people can hope for is to find a thin foam mattress to sleep on, but there isn't one for each family member, and many end up sleeping on the ground. Blankets and pillows are stowed away during the day.\n\nWith few functioning toilets, people are forced to dig latrines or use buckets. According to MAP, on average, up to 600 people are forced to share a single latrine, 30 times more than the minimum standards.\n\nSewage and human waste flow into streets and near shelters as a result.\n\nAccess to basic sanitation and hygiene remains severely limited in Gaza, particularly for women.\n\nWafaa Nasrallah , a displaced mother of two, cannot afford to buy sanitary pads and has tried using rags and even nappies.\n\nShe is one of many women who cannot access hygiene items, and some have resorted to taking medication  to stop their menstrual cycles entirely .\n\nMenstruating women and girls also do not have access to enough water to wash or privacy in bathroom facilities to enable them to do so, even if they find the water.\n\n“Girls are sleeping on bare ground during their periods due to the lack of clean bedding or private space,” says Saeed.\n\nIsrael has rendered more than 85 percent of Gaza’s water and sanitation infrastructure inoperable, from wells to treatment facilities.\n\nPreventable diseases are spreading in the camps due to overcrowding, the lack of clean facilities and a lack of medication.\n\nAccording to a Journal of Medicine, Surgery, and Public Health paper published in April, Gaza currently faces an enormous infectious disease caseload, with 700,000 officially reported cases.\n\nContaminated water sources will “propagate waterborne illnesses such as cholera and dysentery, exacerbating the public health crisis”, where poverty, overcrowding, inadequate hygiene, contaminated food and a lack of safe drinking water all serve as significant risk factors for cholera.\n\nSatellite imagery from October 2023 to September 2025 shows that Israel has flattened entire neighbourhoods across all five of Gaza’s governorates, forcing some two million people to flee, mostly south.\n\nNorth Gaza was the first governorate to receive expulsion orders within the first week of the war. As more Palestinians were pushed south, many believed Rafah would be safe, but Israel attacked there anyway.\n\nSatellite imagery from November 2023, one month after the war began, through January 2024, shows a camp area in Rafah completely razed in the space of two months.\n\nThen, Israel claimed that al-Mawasi, a desolate coastal area in southern Gaza with no facilities, would be a “humanitarian zone”, ordering most people to go there. Within months, it was packed with hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Since then, Israel has repeatedly bombed the safe zone, and several Israeli massacres killing and injuring hundreds of people have shocked the world.\n\nSatellite imagery around Hamad Hospital in Rafah on April 23 and July 18, 2025, shows tents and shelters around the hospital in April, but they have all but disappeared by July.\n\nThe satellite image below of Gaza Community College in Khan Younis from December 19, 2023 and February 4, 2024, shows a camp settlement almost disappearing within two months, the fate of the displaced people there unknown.\n\nAn encampment in Jabalia had tents on August 12, 2024, and was nearly empty on November 11, 2024.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency geolocated at least 954 documented shelters established across the Gaza Strip over the past two years, based on information from the local and international groups running them.\n\nMost of these shelters, 65 percent or 624 sites, are camps of makeshift tents, often patched together from tarpaulin, metal, fabric or nylon.\n\nAnother 282 shelters are in schools and repurposed buildings, 14 are in hospitals, and the remaining 34 are in other facilities such as community centres, mosques, municipal buildings and warehouses.\n\nSeveral families can be found crowded into one tent or one school classroom, without adequate furniture for sleeping, sitting, eating, cooking, or preserving minimal privacy.\n\nPeople struggle without clean water, vital medicine or enough food to survive.\n\nOver the past two years, Israel has attacked 447 of all of Gaza’s shelters, destroying, damaging or forcing them to close.\n\nAn analysis of satellite imagery from these locations found the following:\n\nOne in four Israeli attacks targeted shelters, displacement centres, or internally displaced person (IDP) camps, of a total of at least 20,000 recorded attacks on Gaza, according to data from ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data).\n\nBetween October 7, 2023, and September 19, 2025, Israel killed 22,402 displaced people in 4,900 such attacks, meaning that, at the time, roughly 39 percent of all people Israel killed in Gaza were killed in displacement shelters.\n\nThe animated map below shows where these 4,900 attacks were distributed around the Gaza Strip.\n\nMost attacks have been air and drone strikes, accounting for 72 percent (3,554 incidents).\n\nArtillery, shelling and missile fire made up 23 percent (1,139 incidents).\n\nOther violent events, such as clashes or direct assaults, contributed the remaining 5 percent."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl09v025lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"10:34:51.090+00:00","title":"Jamaica wakes to no electricity and destruction after Hurricane Melissa","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to hit Jamaica in modern history with winds exceeding 298 km/h, caused catastrophic damage across the island on October 29, 2025.

Melissa\n\nThe normal soundtrack that accompanies Jamaican life is silent this morning as many have woken to no electricity.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the island is without power and many parts of its western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after Hurricane Melissa tore across the island with catastrophic force.\n\nAs wind and rain lashed through the night, one local official said the destruction resembled \"the scene of an apocalypse movie.\"\n\nWith communications crippled, the true scale of the disaster remains unknown. Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a \"disaster area\" late Tuesday, warning of \"devastating impacts\" and \"significant damage\" to hospitals, homes and businesses.\n\nAlthough no deaths have yet been confirmed, Montego Bay's mayor Richard Vernon told the BBC his first task at daybreak would be \"to check if everybody is alive.\"\n\nHurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike Jamaica in modern history, barrelled across the country on Tuesday, leaving behind a trail of ruin.\n\nAt its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph) - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people.\n\n\"It resembled the scene of an apocalypse movie\", an MP in western Jamaica told Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner.\n\nFrancis described the night as \"stressful\" and \"intense\", marked by relentless heavy wind and rain.\n\n\"You don't have a connection. You can't speak to the people you normally speak to,\" she told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme.\n\nAcross Jamaica's central parishes, Francis said, floodwaters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes.\n\nOne anonymous woman told the BBC: \"There is water coming in through the roof of my house. I am not okay.\"\n\nWhile no fatalities had been confirmed, Jamaica's prime minister told CNN he feared \"there would be some loss of life.\" Damage, he said, was widespread - hitting hospitals, schools, homes and businesses.\n\nLocal government minister Desmond Mckenzie said on Tuesday afternoon that the southwestern parish of St Elizabeth was \"under water\", with at least three families trapped in their homes in the community of Black River.\n\n\"Rescue teams are struggling to reach them because of the dangerous conditions\", he said at a news conference.\n\nVerna Genus was sheltering from the storm at her four bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house.\n\nThe 73-year-old vegetable farmer was in the house with her sons and baby grandchild when the hurricane made landfall over the area.\n\nVerna has lost communications due to the power lines being down. But her UK-based sister, June Powell, spoke to the BBC about what happened.\n\n\"She was crying on the phone,\" June said, adding: \"You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that - she was wailing 'we are all finished.'\"\n\nShe is anxiously waiting for the communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister.\n\nSt Elizabeth, known as Jamaica's breadbasket, produces much of the island's produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover.\n\nOn the north coast, Montego Bay - the heart of Jamaica's tourism industry and home to its main airport - will also take time to get back on its feet. This hurricane has put a hand around the neck of the Jamaican economy.\n\nMontego city was split in two by floodwaters, Mayor Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: \"Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\"\n\nHis immediate concern, he added, was simple: \"Check if everybody is alive.\"\n\nIn rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: \"Right now, what I'm seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\"\n\nMeteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters - part of a broader trend linked to climate change.\n\nBy the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles.\n\nHealth officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that floodwaters could drive the reptiles into residential areas.\n\nFor thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty.\n\n\"I've never heard anything like it,\" said Pia Chevallier from Cambridge, who travelled to Jamaica with her 15-year-old son on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live from her darkened hotel room, she said: \"The glass in the windows and patio doors was all vibrating. The doors sounded like they were slamming, even though they were closed. It was horrendous.\"\n\nShe added: \"There's debris everywhere - palm trees, coconuts, branches, all over the place. The big palm trees with all the roots are up. That's how strong the winds have been.\"\n\nOn the north coast, Wayne Gibson, a British tourist from Kent holidaying in Ocho Rios with his wife and two teenage daughters, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they were sheltering in a communal hall.\n\nKyle Holmes from Bolton, visiting Lucea in the north west, described the hotel as \"a disaster zone\" and said he had no idea when they will be able to get home.\n\nHurricane Melissa had moved on to make landfall in Cuba by early Wednesday morning, leaving Jamaica paralysed and silent. Though it has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, it remains powerful with wind speeds of over 200km/h (124mph).\n\nJamaica has a catastrophe bond - a type of insurance for the country - which will hopefully allow people to get back on their feet, but the issue is what's done in the interim.\n\nAdditional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy\n\nIf it is safe to do so, you can also get in touch by following this link"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wl0n95949o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:15:23.818+00:00","title":"The 79-year-old boxer who became an unlikely star","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frank Gilfeather, a 79-year-old retired boxer from Dundee, Scotland, has unexpectedly risen to global fame through motivational boxing videos shared on social media.

but now, at the age of 79, he has become an unlikely star.\n\nHe has amassed millions of fans around the world with his motivational videos sharing his passion for the noble art.\n\nThe Dundee-born boxer is followed by legends such as current heavyweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk and former champ Lennox Lewis as well as Scottish football legend Ally McCoist and A-list actor Channing Tatum.\n\nHis late-life boxing fame began three years ago when his son Paul made a video in which he said to Frank: \"Show me how to throw an uppercut\".\n\nFrank, looking fit and focused despite his years, tells him it can be \"one of the most devastating punches in boxing\".\n\nThe white-haired veteran then demonstrates the technique with a series of perfectly-delivered powerful blows to a punchbag mounted on the gym wall.\n\nThe TikTok video now has 853,000 views, with the comments admiring his old school boxing skills and praising his dedication to remaining fit despite his age.\n\n\"They are thinking there's some trick here, this guy is nearly 80, how can he do that?,\" Frank says.\n\nThe secret is a lifelong love of the sport, which began early.\n\nWhen he was four his dad started a club in the Lochee area of Dundee in an attempt to get young kids off the street and keep them out of trouble.\n\n\"We had no ring,\" he says.\n\n\"There were some punch bags, which were ex-sailors' kit bags stuffed with sawdust. It was very primitive, but we loved it.\"\n\nAt the age of 10, Frank started boxing seriously and he went on to have 200 amateur fights, representing Scotland across Europe and fighting against greats such as Ken Buchanan.\n\n\"It taught you discipline,\" Frank says.\n\n\"You've got to be turning up for training, you've got to be training hard, you've got to be regularly training.\n\n\"It teaches you respect for your fellow men and respect for your elders.\"\n\nBut by 21, Frank felt like he had enough and was satisfied with what he'd accomplished.\n\nHe needed a career so he gave up boxing and took up a job as trainee journalist at the Arbroath Guide newspaper.\n\nA long career in sports journalism followed, including working for ITV's Grampian TV, where the closest he got to a fight was with Alex Ferguson, the notoriously hot-headed manager of Aberdeen in the 1980s.\n\nIt was not until decades later, when he was in his late 50s, that Frank, by then a father-of-four, started working out again at his local boxing gym.\n\n\"I thought 'I'll go to the gym and keep with it',\" he says.\n\n\"I felt guilty that I wasn't doing anything in terms of physical exercise.\"\n\nFrank spent the next 15 years consistently working out and staying fit.\n\n\"I worked out three times a week, full session, the same as everyone else. I loved it,\" he says.\n\nThen three years ago the uppercut video went viral and his hundreds of followers soon became tens of thousands.\n\n\"TikTok was like a wildfire,\" he says. \"Soon we were at 50,000 followers and then 70,000 and I'm thinking 'this is crazy'.\"\n\nAfter this, other videos started to take off, with Frank sharing more boxing techniques or just general fitness motivation.\n\nThis led to Frank and his son Paul expanding their reach to other platforms such as Youtube and Instagram under the handle  'franksnobleart' .\n\nOne of his videos reached 4.5 million views and his account is now at 688,000 followers, including former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva and Terence Crawford, the undisputed world champion boxer in three different weight classes.\n\nFrank's sudden rise in fame has opened some unexpected doors for a retired journalist in his late 70s.\n\nIn July, he met current heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk while he was in London for his rematch against Daniel Dubois.\n\n\"He walks out, sees me standing there and he just stops everything and walks right over to me and gives me a big hug,\" Frank says.\n\n\"I thought, 'that's the heavyweight champion of the world'.\"\n\nFrank was also flown to Riyadh earlier this year by Turki Al-Sheikh, a prominent figure in Saudi Arabian sports relations, to attend the high-profile rematch between Bivol and Beterbiev for the undisputed light heavyweight title.\n\nHe says he stayed in a hotel suite that was bigger than his flat back home in Aberdeen - something he had never experienced during his own boxing career.\n\nIn Saudi, Frank found himself rubbing shoulders with other boxing legends.\n\n\"You walk into the VIP room because you're one of them now,\" he says.\n\n\"You've got guys like Lennox Lewis, who's a giant, coming over and saying, 'I follow you'.\"\n\nAs well as his social media videos, Frank now travels the world giving coaching seminars in places like Lanzarote, Paris and New York.\n\n\"It's so overwhelming, I can't believe it, especially at my age,\" he says.\n\n\"I get inquiries from all over the world, can you come here? could you do a seminar? Yeah, go for it.\"\n\nAnother new venture is a boxing glove business with his son Paul which is selling in 56 countries.\n\n\"We reinvented the bag mitt but Paul takes care of all that,\" Frank says.\n\n\"Sometimes it's hard to keep up with the orders.\"\n\nFrank believes in a very traditional old-school style of boxing where opponents have mutual respect for each other.\n\nHe rejects the modern spectacle of boxing hype and trash talk, instead he  advocates for the noble art of self-defence.\n\n\"All that hype I absolutely hate it, just go and box,\" he says.\n\nFrank says the main message from his videos is the life values that boxing teaches people.\n\n\"It's not about aggression, it's the noble art of self defence\" he says.\n\nHe says he wants people to be inspired to believe in themselves and it seems to be working.\n\n\"I have had heaps and heaps of comments and questions from people saying, I suffer from mental illness, I watch what you're doing and it's inspired me to get off the couch,\" he says.\n\n\"I have had addicts come on and said, 'I watch your videos. I absolutely love what you're doing and I'm trying to follow in your footsteps'.\"\n\n\"I want people to say to themselves, 'if he can do it, then at least I can try.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p6z2j5dro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:24:21.793+00:00","title":"Tight race in Dutch election as anti-Islam populist Wilders' hope of power declines","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Dutch election features a tight race between Geert Wilders’ anti-Islam Freedom Party (PVV) and several other major parties, including GreenLeft-Labour, D66, and the Christian Democrats.

2025-10-29T07:24:21.793+00:00\n\nTitle: Tight race in Dutch election as anti-Islam populist Wilders' hope of power declines\n\nGeert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom party is facing a tight race in Wednesday's Dutch election, and even if he wins the vote his hopes of forming a new government appear minimal.\n\nWilders was the clear winner last time Dutch voters went to the polls in November 2023, but final opinion polls ahead of voting suggest a fall in his support.\n\nDutch voters are grappling with a series of crises, from a chronic housing shortage to overcrowded asylum centres. The cost of living is rising with sky-high rents and healthcare costs.\n\nUnlike last time, Wilders' rivals are refusing to work with him after he brought down his own coalition government last June.\n\nVoting at most of the country's more than 10,000 polling stations continues until 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nCommentators believe it is more important who comes second in the vote than first, as it could decide who will form the next government.\n\nEven if Wilders' party comes top, the next Dutch government is more likely to come from the centre left or centre right.\n\nThe race is wide open, and more than a third of Dutch voters were seen as undecided on the eve of the election.\n\n\"It's one of the most important elections, because people need to have their faith restored,\" says Sarah de Lange, professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.\n\nAs many as 15 parties are set to win a share of parliament's 150 seats, but opinion polls suggest four will stand out. Apart from Wilders' PVV, there is GreenLeft-Labour under ex-EU top official Frans Timmermans, Rob Jetten's liberal D66 and the centre-right Christian Democrats of Henri Bontenbal.\n\nFor almost half of Dutch voters, the housing crisis is top priority, with a shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.\n\nHousing has taken stage in the election, and although Wilders has blamed the crisis on migration, others point to a rise in single-person households and planning gridlock.\n\nMost of the parties have vowed to tackle the issue head-on. Frans Timmermans promises at least 100,000 new homes per year if his party takes office, while Rob Jetten of the liberals says the solution lies on building on 1% of agricultural land.\n\nUnemployment hit 4% last month, which is low in European terms but the highest rate for four years in the Netherlands. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose 8.8% over the past year, signalling growing anxiety among workers about job security.\n\nConsidered for so long the outsider of Dutch politics, Geert Wilders played a key role in the last government, both in setting it up and in bringing it down after only 11 months, in a row over immigration.\n\nHis coalition partners refused to let him become prime minister, but having former spy chief Dick Schoof lead a technocrat cabinet was a workaround that ultimately failed.\n\nFormer coalition partner Dilan Yesilgöz, the leader of the conservative-liberal VVD, told Wilders his \"party exists as one man with a Twitter account and nothing more\".\n\nYesilgöz's jibe was not completely out of place as Wilders does not allow his PVV to have members. Yesilgöz's own VVD party is polling down in fifth place.\n\nWilders was on the backfoot ahead of the vote, having to apologise to Frans Timmermans after two Freedom party MPs posted AI-generated images of the left-wing leader being led away in handcuffs.\n\nWhen Wilders won two years ago, Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam says he was able to harness the votes of more radical voters on the right who were worried about Islam and Eurosceptic along with less radical voters.\n\n\"People called him Milders, a milder version of himself,\" says Prof Rooduijn, who points out that Wilders then put on ice many of his anti-Islam policies to appear more palatable.\n\nAlthough Wilders no longer talks of banning mosques and the Koran, he sees Islam as \"the greatest existential threat to our freedom\", a view Prof Rooduijn describes as \"really a key element of his nativism - an exclusionary form of nationalism\".\n\nIn one TV debate, Wilders said \"take a walk [in central Rotterdam] on shopping night on Saturday evening and it's like you're in Marrakesh; it's not the Netherlands any more\".\n\nLeft-wing leader Timmermans has accused him of scapegoating an entire section of society: \"You're blaming Islam.\"\n\nBut the risk Wilders faces now is of losing both the more radical voters, if they fail to turn out, and the less radical voters who could drift to other parties, including the anti-immigration Ja21.\n\n\"Right now I don't think it's very likely Wilders will be part of a government coalition,\" Prof Rooduijn believes.\n\nIt can take weeks - if not months - for parties to form a coalition, but if the centre right takes power, Christian Democrat Henri Bontenbal could be in the frame to lead it.\n\nHis CDA party has staged a remarkable comeback in that only two years ago they won just five seats.\n\nBontenbal believes Dutch voters are looking now at a return to \"what I'll call 'boring politics'. The Netherlands is done with populism\".\n\nHe has not had a great campaign, though.\n\nDays after he defended the right of religious schools to teach that homosexual relationships were wrong, he went back on himself and admitted he had made a mistake."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8670d9xq32o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:27:01.153+00:00","title":"US troops on Nato's eastern flank to be reduced, Romania says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Romania has announced that the United States plans to reduce its military presence on NATO's eastern flank, decreasing troops from 1,700 to between 900 and 1,000, with one major US brigade at the Mihai Kogalniceanu airbase being rotated out.

approached the Pentagon for comment.\n\nThe presence of US troops at Romania's Deveselu and Campia Turzii bases would remain unchanged, Ionut Mosteanu added.\n\nSince taking office in January US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his wish to shift the focus of US military commitment from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, and has repeatedly urged European Nato members to take more responsibility for the continent's defence.\n\nBut the announcement of the US troop withdrawal from Romania will be concerning for Eastern European countries, many of which feel they have reason to fear a Russian attack in the future.\n\nShortly after the announcement from Bucharest, a Nato official stressed that Washington's commitment to the Nato alliance remained \"clear\" and adjustments were \"not unusual\".\n\n\"Even with this adjustment, the US force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more US forces on the continent than before 2022,\" the official said in a statement.\n\nThe US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, according to figures from late last year.\n\nLast month Nato announced the creation of a mission dubbed Eastern Sentry, which it said would enhance the alliance's vigilance along the entire eastern flank.\n\nThe decision came after a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, in the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Days later,  Romania reported that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, and Estonia said Russian warplanes had violated its airspace too."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkj2yw122o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:22:12.057+00:00","title":"'My hopes are dashed': Illegal Indian migrants deported by US speak to BBC","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the deportation of at least 54 Indian migrant workers from the US, all from Haryana, who had entered via the dangerous 'donkey route' or 'dunki route'.

seeding: Why Delhi's artificial rain experiment to tackle toxic air failed\n\nAuthorities in Indian capital Delhi unsuccessfully carried out a cloud seeding trial, which is the science of altering clouds to make rains, to tackle the city's worsening air pollution on Tuesday.\n\nCloud seeding is done by firing small particles - usually silver iodide - into clouds to produce rain. The technique is used around the world, but experts doubt its efficacy as a long-term air pollution control measure.\n\nA team of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and the Delhi government carried out the trial over several neighbourhoods, as thick smog enveloped the city.\n\nBut the attempt - the first in 53 years - was \"not completely successful\" due to the lack of moisture in the air.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) - which measures the level of PM 2.5 or fine particulate matter in the air that can clog lungs - has been hovering between 300 and 400, which is nearly 20 times the acceptable limit.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities used a Cessna aircraft to release fire flares containing silver iodide and sodium chloride into the atmosphere.\n\nIn a statement, IIT Kanpur said that despite the lack of rain, there had been a measurable reduction in particulate matter because of Tuesday's experiment, \"indicating that even under limited moisture conditions, cloud seeding can contribute to improved air quality\".\n\nHowever, the institute's director Manindra Agarwal told BBC Hindi that this can't be a long-term fix for Delhi's perennial pollution problem.\n\n\"One measure of success is if it rains, which certainly did not happen,\" said Mr Agarwal. \"The moisture content in the clouds yesterday [Tuesday] was very low. We will continue our efforts in the near future.\"\n\nThe trial is likely to be repeated in the coming weeks after the moisture levels in the clouds increases again, Delhi's Environment Minister Manjinder Sirsa told reporters.\n\nDelhi's first cloud-seeding experiment was carried out in 1957, followed by another attempt in 1972, according to the  Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology .\n\nWhile those experiments were aimed at drought management, this was the first indigenous effort at cloud seeding to control pollution, said Mr Agarwal.\n\nThe city had considered cloud seeding in  2023  as well, but the plan did not materialise due to pending court approvals.\n\nBack then, scientists had also highlighted how it was an expensive strategy with low success rates.\n\nCloud seeding speeds up the condensation of moisture in clouds to create rain. The salt granules act as ice-nucleating particles, which enable ice crystals to form in the clouds. The moisture in the clouds then latches on to these ice crystals and condenses into rain.\n\nBut the process doesn't always work and is dependent on the right amount of moisture and humidity in the clouds to allow for ice nuclei to form.\n\nThere is not enough empirical evidence on how much the AQI can come down by cloud seeding, climate change and sustainability expert Abinash Mohanty told the BBC in 2023.\n\n\"We also don't know what its [cloud seeding] effects are because in the end you're trying to alter natural processes and that's bound to have limitations.\"\n\nGlobally cloud seeding exercises have yielded mixed results.\n\nChina has boasted about its success to manage rains before  hosting the Olympics , with Beijing using rockets, cannons and drones to do cloud seeding.\n\nHowever, in the United Arab Emirates, questions over the technique were raised, following  floods in Dubai  last year.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   Twitter  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/kelsey-grammer-baby-son-62de13855c2de53ea317ca6958f71645","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"15:20:40+00:00","title":"Kelsey Grammer Announces Birth of Fourth Child, Christopher","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kelsey Grammer and his wife Kayte Walsh have welcomed their fourth child, named Christopher, who joins their family of eight.

in the Pacific, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said.\n\nMexico's navy says it is still searching for a lone survivor approximately 400 miles (643km) from the Pacific coastal city of Acapulco.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of attacks on boats the US says have been carrying drugs in both the Pacific and Caribbean.\n\nThe latest strikes in the eastern Pacific, which Hegseth said happened on Monday at the direction of President Donald Trump, mark an escalation in what it has cast as a campaign to stop narcotics from entering the US.\n\nThe strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of the US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told her morning press conference \"we do not agree with these attacks\".  She said she had asked the country's foreign minister, as well as representatives of the navy, to meet the US ambassador.\n\n\"We want all international treaties to be respected,\" she added.\n\nAt least 57 people have now been killed in the strikes, which has led to increasing tensions between the US and the governments of both Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nMost strikes have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but recently the US has turned its attention to the Pacific Ocean as well.\n\nIn a statement on X, Hegseth said the four vessels that were hit on Monday \"were known by our intelligence apparatus, transitioning along known narco-trafficking routes and carrying narcotics\".\n\nHe added that eight \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the first strike. Four and three were killed in the following two strikes.\n\nOne person survived the strikes. According to Hegseth, Mexican search-and-rescue authorities \"accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue.\"\n\nThe condition of the survivor or his current whereabouts are unclear. Mexico's navy said in a statement that it had dispatched a patrol boat and an aircraft to conduct search operations to \"safeguard human life at sea\".\n\nHegseth's post included videos that show several vessels catching fire after being struck by US munitions.\n\n\"The department has spent over two decades defending other homelands,\" he wrote. \"Now, we're defending our own.\"\n\nAt least four of the strikes have so far taken place in the Pacific, which is a far more significant drug-trafficking corridor, with the rest taking place in the Caribbean.\n\nPresident Trump has said he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters, but suggested last week that he may seek approval from Congress if the campaign is expanded to include targets on land.\n\nTrump has said he is \"totally prepared\" to strike land-based targets, which would mark a significant escalation in the campaign.\n\nThe strikes, however, have drawn criticism from international law experts and both the Venezuelan and Colombian governments.\n\nMary Ellen O'Connell, an international law expert at Notre Dame University and former military educator with the defence department, said the \"criminal suspects are entitled to due process\".\n\n\"It is a greater crime to summarily execute people suspected of drug trafficking than drug trafficking is,\" she added.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme last week, Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Mauricio Jaramillo said the strikes were \"disproportionate and outside international law\".\n\nJaramillo said those on the vessels had \"no possibility to defend themselves\" and were struck with \"no process\" and \"no judicial order\".\n\nThe strikes also come as tensions ratchet up with both governments. The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".\n\nIn the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week  ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.\n\nTrump has accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power.\n\nThe country's attorney general told the BBC  there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.\n\nThe US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.

Hamas said it had \"no connection\" to the attack and was committed to the deal.\n\nUS President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire, but added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.\n\nThe Israeli strikes hit homes, schools and residential blocks in Gaza City and Beit Lahia in the north of Gaza, Bureij and Nuseirat in the centre, and Khan Younis in the south.\n\nWitnesses in Gaza City described seeing \"pillars of fire and smoke\" rising into the air as explosions shook several residential areas.\n\nGaza's health ministry said a total of 104 people were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, and that more than 250 others were injured.\n\nThree women and a man who were pulled from the rubble of the al-Banna family's home in the southern Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.\n\nIn the urban Bureij refugee camp, five members of the Abu Sharar family were killed in a strike on their home in the Block 7 area, it said.\n\nAnother five people were killed when aircraft targeted a vehicle on a road north-west of Khan Younis, the agency added.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday morning that it had \"begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire\" after carrying out a series of strikes on what it described as \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\", including at least 30 commanders of armed groups.\n\n\"The IDF will continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it,\" it added.\n\nA brief statement put out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Tuesday evening said he had ordered the IDF to carry out \"forceful strikes\" on Gaza but did not specify his reasons.\n\nHowever, his defence minister said Hamas had crossed \"a bright red line\" by launching an attack on Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday.\n\n\"Hamas will pay many times over for attacking the soldiers and for violating the agreement to return the fallen hostages,\" Israel Katz warned.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the IDF announced that a reservist soldier, Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, was killed.\n\nA military source said the attack took place in the southern city of Rafah on the Israeli side of the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates IDF-controlled territory inside Gaza under the ceasefire deal.\n\nSgt Feldbaum was killed when one of the vehicles of an IDF engineering team that was dismantling an underground tunnel route in Rafah was hit by fire from \"terrorists in the area\", according to the source.\n\n\"A few minutes later, several anti-tank missiles were fired at another armoured vehicle belonging to the troops in the area. No injuries were reported,\" they added.\n\nHamas issued a statement denying that its fighters had attacked Israeli troops and condemning the Israeli strikes.\n\n\"Hamas affirms that it has no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah and affirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement,\" it said.\n\n\"The criminal bombardment carried out by the fascist occupation [Israeli] army on areas of the Gaza Strip represents a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\"\n\nThe group's military wing meanwhile said it would postpone the return of a hostage's body it had recovered on Tuesday due to what it called Israeli \"violations\".\n\nThe US played down concerns that all-out hostilities could resume.\n\nOn board Air Force One, President Trump told reporters: \"As I understand it, they took out, they killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back.\"\n\n\"Nothing is going to jeopardise\" the ceasefire, he said. \"You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Israel's prime minister had pledged to take unspecified \"steps\" against Hamas after the group handed over the previous day a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased hostages still in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's office said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli hostage whose body was recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023, and that this constituted a \"clear violation\" of the ceasefire deal.\n\nThe IDF also released footage from a drone that it said showed Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" in eastern Gaza City on Monday.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards,\" it added, the operatives \"summoned representatives of the Red Cross and staged a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"\n\nHamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) later condemned what it called the \"fake recovery\", saying it had attended the scene \"at the request of Hamas\" and \"in good faith\".\n\nIt went on: \"The ICRC team at this location were not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage – in general, our role as neutral intermediary does not include unearthing of the bodies of the deceased.\n\n\"Our team only observed what appeared to be the recovery of remains without prior knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.\"\n\nThe ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey is supposed to implement the first stage of Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan.\n\nIt said Hamas would return its 48 living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect on 10 October.\n\nAll 20 living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\n\nIsrael has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.\n\nEleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing challenges because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\". He also said that \"some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them\".\n\nHowever, the Israeli government insists Hamas knows the locations of all the bodies.\n\nAlthough the ceasefire deal appeared to acknowledge that Hamas might not be able to return all the deceased hostages within the original timeframe, Trump warned the group on Saturday that it had to hand over those remaining \"quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action\".\n\nAll but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.\n\nIsrael responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than  68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk7zg0gzvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"00:09:22.269+00:00","title":"The AI job cuts are here - or are they?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing narrative that artificial intelligence is driving widespread job cuts, citing examples from Amazon, Chegg, Salesforce, and UPS.

longstanding anxiety: that Artificial Intelligence is starting to replace workers.\n\nThe tech giant  joined a growing list of companies  in the US that have pointed to AI technology as a reason behind layoffs.\n\nBut some question whether AI is fully to blame - and have voiced scepticism that recent high-profile layoffs are a telling sign of the technology's effect on employment.\n\nChegg, the online education firm, cited the \"new realities\" of AI as it announced a 45% reduction in workforce on Monday. When Salesforce cut 4,000 customer service roles last month, its chief executive said AI agents were doing the work.\n\nUPS said on Tuesday that it has cut 48,000 jobs since last year. The delivery company's chief executive previously linked redundancies, in part, to machine learning.\n\nBut extrapolating from executives' remarks during cuts is \"possibly the worst way\" to determine the effects of AI on jobs, said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nCompany-specific dynamics, she said, are often at play.\n\n\"There is a real tendency, because everyone is so freaked out about the possible impact of AI on the labour market moving forward, to overreact to individual company announcements,\" Ms Gimbel said.\n\nCertain subsets of the workforce - recent college graduates and data centre employees, for example - in fact are particularly vulnerable to the technology's adoption.\n\nA recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found a correlation between occupations with a higher prevalence of AI and increases in unemployment since 2022.\n\nBut Morgan Frank, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has studied unemployment risk by occupation and found that the only workers affected by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 were in the office and administrative support sector.\n\nFor them, their probability of claiming unemployment jumped in early 2023, he said - immediately following the entrance of the chat bot developed by OpenAI.\n\nBut for computer and maths occupations, \"there is no discernible change in the trend around the launch of ChatGPT\", he said.\n\n\"Both tech workers and admin workers - they're in a rougher job market than they were in a couple years ago,\" Mr Frank said.\n\n\"I'd be sceptical that AI is the reason for all of it, though,\" he added.\n\nAmazon and many of its rivals in the tech sector hired at a rapid clip in the years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic and in the pandemic's early months, when the Federal Reserve lowered US interest rates to near zero.\n\nThe hiring set these firms up for eventual workforce reductions, experts said - a dynamic separate from the generative AI boom over the last three years.\n\nThe Fed also started hiking interest rates around the time that ChapGPT was launched.\n\n\"A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,\"said Ms Gimbel, of the Budget Lab.\n\n\"But so far, nothing that I've seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle.\"\n\nA big question, she added, is what hiring patterns look like when the economy returns to a period of solid growth.\n\nIn the long run, Ms Gimbel said, breaking out the cyclical versus AI-driven job losses will be crucial. If, for instance, the US economy were to fall into a recession, human resources and marketing jobs would be the expected casualties.\n\nThose jobs, though, also happen to be exposed to AI, complicating the task of identifying whether the cuts are a result of macroeconomic conditions or the technology's adoption - or both.\n\nAmazon, which confirmed it plans to cut roughly 14,000 corporate roles, said it needs to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by AI.\n\nThe company has been performing well. It reported quarterly results in July that beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn).\n\nEnrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that the largest tech companies like Amazon are at the forefront of AI-related job cuts, \"in part because they're both producers and consumers of AI\".\n\nStill, he acknowledged that a correction following robust hiring during the pandemic also may have driven the company's latest round of layoffs.\n\nAmazon is likely able to automate jobs faster than most of its rivals because of its scale, said Lawrence Schmidt, an associate professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\n\"It's not at all crazy to think that Amazon might want to shed certain types of roles, or refrain from hiring additional people in certain types of roles, if they can be quickly automated,\" Mr Schmidt said.\n\n\"Regardless of what happens to counts of jobs overall,\" he added, \"you would expect there to be reallocation.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgm37ny34zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"02:34:30.115+00:00","title":"Cameroon opposition leader to face legal action over alleged election unrest, government says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Cameroon's 12 October election, where President Paul Biya secured 53.7% of the vote against opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary's 35.2%, violence erupted with at least four protesters killed in clashes between demonstrators and security forces.

2025-10-29T11:10:31.956+00:00\n\nTitle: ‘I have to get what I need right now’: Americans prepare for expiry of critical Snap food benefits\n\nChantille Manuel has spent the past five years transforming her life.\n\nThe Florida resident has celebrated five years in recovery for addiction, she has lost more than 140lbs (64kg), and has started her own businesses, a beauty salon.\n\nDespite all these successes, Ms Manuel has struggled to put food on the table and depends on food assistance from local churches and the US government alike, to keep herself fed.\n\n\"I don't want to have to have help from anybody, I want to be self-sufficient,\" she says.\n\nShe is one of the more than 40 million Americas who may not get essential food assistance after Saturday, because of an ongoing government shutdown caused by the inability of Congress to agree a new funding deal.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) is used by one in eight Americans - including Ms Manuel - and plays a vital role in how many people purchase their groceries. It works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food.\n\nBut officials who oversee the programme say they will not have the funds to pay full benefits from 1 November.\n\nMs Manuel spent the last of her October Snap money last week on essentials like coffee, creamer and tuna.\n\nShe could not pause to consider whether or not the government would find a solution before Saturday when she made her purchases.\n\n“It’s either going to be there or it’s not,” she says. “So I might as well get what I need right now.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration declined to draw on a contingency fund that would have continued benefits, saying this was needed for potential emergencies such as natural disasters.\n\nAt any rate, even those contingency funds would not have been enough to fully resolve the issue. They would only cover about 60% of a single month of benefits payments, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have disagreed over using the contingency funding to at least ease the situation.\n\nDemocrats have argued that the Trump administration has already secured funding for other essential services during the shutdown - such as keeping up payments to members of the military - so could do the same with Snap.\n\nTrump's Republicans, meanwhile, say that Snap will receive its funding once again if Democrats reopened the government - seeking to blame the opposition party for an impasse which is now in its fifth week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats in the US Senate introduced legislation to continue to fund Snap during the shutdown. It remains unclear if that has enough votes to pass.\n\nWhile lawmakers in Washington continue to play the blame game, the “fundamental safety net” of Snap hangs in the balance, says Hanna Garth, a Brown University professor who studies food insecurity.\n\n“Many users make very little money, even though they work,“ she says. “And so it becomes this critical lifeline that keeps families out of deep, deep poverty. It can also be the tipping point that moves some families above the poverty line.”\n\nBecause these funds might not be replenished from Saturday onwards, many Americans will have to turn to other places to get food - like food banks.\n\nOn a sunny Tuesday, a dozen or so volunteers fill a warehouse packaging space inside the All Faiths Food Bank in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nThey fed more than 80,000 people with more than 22 million pound of food last year, and the need in the area continues to grow, says Nelle Miller, the food bank's CEO.\n\nSince the current government shutdown began, the food bank has seen an increase in people needing food.\n\n“We had three hurricanes here last year. It was a disaster, but this is a new storm,” she says. “The difference is that people will not immediately recover.”\n\nRoughly 20,000 people in the area use Snap benefits, she says - and of those people, roughly 6,000 also use the food bank’s resources.\n\nMs Miller is worried about what happens to those 14,000 Snap recipients after their payouts dry up this weekend. Will they need the food bank’s help as well, she asks.\n\nWhile All Faiths is able to redistribute its food supplies in order to feed more people in case of need, that would mean each person getting less food, she explains.\n\n“Receiving food is an inalienable right. You’re born on Earth, there’s enough food here to feed everyone. It’s a distribution problem,” Ms Miller says.\n\n“I just can’t imagine denying food, water, or air to any human being. This is really difficult, it’s very distressing.”\n\nA family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, according to CBPP, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per person per day.\n\nBut as an individual, Austin Lemmer receives even less than that - $295 each month.\n\nHe has already spent his October Snap benefits and is readying himself to not receive next month’s.\n\n“I’m super anxious,\" he says. \"I’ve been trying to stretch the little bit of food that I have as far as possible, but there’s only so much you can do, especially when you’re already living on bags of rice and canned beans.”\n\nIndividual states administer the programmes, with much of the funding coming from the federal government.\n\nSeveral states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.\n\nSome states - including Florida - have said their Snap recipients will lose benefits if nothing is done before the weekend.\n\nIn an effort to stop that, on Tuesday, 25 Democrat attorneys general in 25 states plus the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over its plan to halt funding for food aid.\n\nThey argued that a decision by the administration to not use the contingency funds would be unlawful and deprive millions of Americans from being able to afford groceries.\n\nResponding to the lawsuit, the US Department of Agriculture blamed Democrats for the fund running dry, and said the party needed to decide whether it wanted to \"hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments\".\n\nThe government shutdown entered its 29th day on Wednesday, and is the second-longest shutdown in history.\n\nThere has been no meaningful progress towards a deal to reopen the government.\n\nThat is something that has frustrated many Snap recipients, like Ms Manuel.\n\n“I don’t feel like [the politicians in Washington] would make the decision that they’re making if it affected them, the way it affects us,” she says.\n\n“As long as they’re eating, that’s what they care about.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dp775nd1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:00:42.461+00:00","title":"Angry Spaniards are still demanding answers a year after Valencia's deadly floods","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A year after catastrophic flash floods in Valencia, Spain — caused by the 'Dana' meteorological phenomenon — killed 229 people, including Miguel and Sara, a husband and daughter from Benetússer, the region continues to grieve and rebuild.

Miguel, and 24-year-old daughter, Sara - their only child - was when flash floods struck their hometown of Benetússer a year ago.\n\nMiguel and Sara went down to the garage in the basement of their home to move their car. But floodwater poured in and they were unable to escape.\n\n\"The military scuba divers who found the bodies of my husband and daughter said that they had managed to get out of the car and they were together, holding each other,\" says Toñi, in tears.\n\nThat was on 29 October 2024, a date now etched into the psyche of the people of Benetússer and many other towns in the Valencia region, in eastern Spain.\n\nThe worst floods Spain had seen for decades - a phenomenon known by meteorologists as the Dana - killed 229 people in the region, with another eight dying in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia.\n\n\"They didn't reach the garage door, because it was so much water, so many metres deep. Water and mud,\" Toñi remembers.\n\n\"I know that they had time to know that they would die,\" she adds. \"It's what hurts me the most – the tragic way in which they died.\"\n\nA year on, Valencia still grieves.\n\nA state memorial service will be held on Wednesday in the City of Arts and Sciences complex, with King Felipe VI and Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez among those expected to attend.\n\nEven for many of those who did not suffer personal loss, the legacy of the tragedy lingers.\n\nJennifer Arango Bonilla and her family watched the floodwaters from the safety of their first-floor flat nearby in Benetússer, but for her nine-year-old son Emmanuel the trauma is hard to leave behind.\n\n\"Whenever it rains he is very scared and thinks it's all going to happen again,\" says Jennifer, adding that the event has affected his behaviour. \"Before, he was boy who talked more, played more and interacted more with other children. Now he's quieter.\"\n\nThis is a common phenomenon among children who were in the towns worst affected by the floods. Nearly a third of them still suffer fear of rain and loud noises and a quarter experience nightmares or insomnia, according to Save the Children.\n\nYet despite the emotional pain, the region has been making substantial strides back to normality.\n\nPaiporta was the town that became synonymous with the Dana because of the enormous devastation it suffered, with 56 inhabitants losing their lives.\n\nThe legacy of the weather phenomenon is still visible there. The ground floors of some buildings are propped up by scaffolding and appear on the verge of collapse and in some areas rubble is piled high as diggers continue the reconstruction work.\n\nBut the mud that caked Paiporta's streets for months after the floods has gone, as have the armoured military vehicles that gave the town the appearance of a war zone, as the army provided help cleaning up and distributing aid.\n\nVicent Ciscar, the mayor, believes full reconstruction could take several more years, with street lighting, for example, yet to be restored. But he says Paiporta has an opportunity to \"become a new, more resilient, town\", given the threat of future weather events.\n\nThis will mean, for example, rethinking how and where cars, which caused so much damage when they were washed away during the Dana, are parked.\n\nCiscar says a range of precautionary measures have already been introduced, including readers to measure the depth of the water in the channel running through the town which burst its banks a year ago, as well as tighter protocols for civil servants to follow during weather alerts.\n\n\"We now have messages that are conveyed to inhabitants regarding what they should or shouldn't do [in the event of a flood] and we are going to be constantly reviewing our procedures in order to avoid a repeat of this disaster,\" he said.\n\nWhile Valencia's infrastructure returns to something like normal and logistical lessons appear to have been learned, anger at the handling of the Dana on the day it struck refuses to fade.\n\nIn particular, the regional government's use of an emergency alarm, sent to the phones of Valencia residents and warning them to remain indoors because of the weather, has come under scrutiny.\n\nThe alarm was not triggered until after 20:00 on 29 October, by which time the flood water had already wreaked havoc and claimed dozens of lives.\n\nThe actions and movements of regional president Carlos Mazón that day have also been criticised, especially given apparent inconsistencies in his own version of events.\n\nIt has emerged that the conservative leader spent nearly four hours in a restaurant with a journalist, Maribel Vilaplana, while other members of his government were attempting to manage the crisis.\n\nHis whereabouts are still unclear between the end of the lunch and his arrival at the headquarters of the local emergency agency, at around 20:30, shortly after the phone alert had been issued.\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Valencia's city centre, the latest in a series of demonstrations calling for Mazón's resignation.\n\n\"He refuses to accept his responsibility, and the people of Valencia deserve for the person who was responsible for everything that happened to be removed and pay for the deaths of 229 people,\" said Clelia Rodríguez, a local woman who took part in the protest.\n\nNoélia Donat, a student who was at the demonstration, said Mazón and his regional government \"have blood on their hands and they have to face justice for their actions\".\n\nThe opprobrium has meant that Mazón has frequently been barracked at public appearances and his presence at Wednesday's state memorial service has been cast in doubt due to objections by victims' relatives.\n\nA recent poll showed that 83% of people in the region believe Mazón should resign.\n\nHowever, he refuses to step down and appears safe, for now, due to the support of the far-right Vox party. The regional government did not respond to requests by the BBC for an interview with a representative.\n\nMazón says the blame for the tragedy lies with the Socialist-led central government and state institutions, such as the national weather agency, for allegedly failing to provide his administration with sufficient information and support on 29 October.\n\nHe has insisted he should be judged on the reconstruction of the region and in September he said his government had made \"a titanic and lung-busting effort\" to \"ensure normality for our roads and public transport and take a giant step in the economic and social recovery of the Valencia region\".\n\nHowever, a judicial inquiry into possible negligence is under way.\n\nThe investigating judge has already flagged the \"notably late\" use of the phone alarm and highlighted the \"avoidability of the overwhelming number of deaths\".\n\nAlthough he has immunity from prosecution, the coming weeks could be delicate for Mazón.\n\nThe magistrate has called the journalist Maribel Vilaplana for questioning on 3 November about the now-infamous lunch she had with him. The Valencia president himself is due to face a Spanish parliamentary commission on 17 November.\n\nBut while the judicial and political fallout from the Dana continues, the people of Valencia are all too aware that this weather phenomenon could strike again with force.\n\n\"We have to teach our kids to handle this problem,\" said Rodrigo Hernández, head of the Valencia regional office for Save the Children. \"We have to be ready for the next one.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7eyg0808xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"23:10:22.090+00:00","title":"No Trump!

No China!\": Caught in middle, South Korea hosts rival superpowers\n\n\"No Trump!\" the rally of hundreds shouted, growing louder as it neared the United States embassy in the centre of South Korea's capital Seoul.\n\nA line of police buses stopped them reaching the gates, but a stage and loudspeaker ensured their voices would soar above Gwanghwamun square and within earshot of US President Donald Trump's representatives.\n\nThis was a small rally by the standards of South Korea's vibrant protest culture. And it was not the only one under way. A few hundred metres to the north, at the gates of Gyeongbokgung palace, marchers held aloft more banners as they chanted a very different message.\n\n\"No China,\" along with a smattering of \"CCP [Chinese Communist Party] out!\". Again, the numbers - several hundred people - were not huge for South Korea.\n\nNevertheless, this footfall through central Seoul on a sunny Saturday is an indication of the diplomatic dance South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung will have to perform this week as he hosts the leaders of both the US and China.\n\nSeoul is - and has long been - a key US ally. A friendship \"forged in blood\", as its leaders often say, during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, when American troops helped repel the North Korean invasion. The South still needs Washington's protection, but it also needs China, its biggest trading partner and a vital market for exports.\n\n\"It's a particularly fraught moment - South Korea finds itself caught between a rock and a hard place,\" says Darcie Draudt-Vejares, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"Year after year it is epitomising the choice of many countries worldwide that are deeply economically integrated with China, but also economically integrated with the US. Right now, Lee Jae-myung is trying to manoeuvre between these superpowers.\"\n\nSo much so that his country is even hosting talks between Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday that may well yield a breakthrough in their on-again-off-again trade war.\n\nAt 61, Lee is a seasoned politician, but he has his work cut out for him.\n\nHis emphatic victory in June followed six months of turmoil. His predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law order triggered huge protests and a constitutional crisis that eventually led to his impeachment, but left the country polarised.\n\nBy the time Lee took office, Trump's tariffs had stunned both allies and rivals. Negotiations began and in August, Lee visited the White House and turned on the charm. It seemed to work.\n\nSouth Korea thought it had appeased its powerful friend. Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas. In return, Trump agreed to lower tariffs from 25% to 15%.\n\nBut then more than 300 South Koreans were detained in a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in the US state of Georgia. Nearly all of them have since returned, but that has shaken ties - especially because Hyundai is a major investor in the US.\n\n\"I don't think the relationship between the US and Korea is necessarily broken at this point,\" said 23-year-old Hye-yeon Lee as the protest outside the US embassy came to an end.\n\n\"Although I do think it is being eroded significantly,\" she added.\n\nThe White House has also increased its demands as part of the trade talks - Trump is now pushing for cash investments in the US. Despite attempts to get a deal signed, there is no final agreement and hopes of reaching one when the two leaders meet on Wednesday are not high.\n\n\"South Korea has a huge amount on the line in terms of their prosperity and their security with this visit, but in a funny way, the less time Donald Trump is here could be better for President Lee Jae-myung,\" says John Delury, a senior fellow at the Asia Society's Centre on US-China relations.\n\n\"It doesn't look like they're near a breakthrough on their trade agreement. And so, if Trump comes, has his meetings, they go well, and he's out of here in 24 hours, that's not a terrible outcome as far as South Korea is concerned.\"\n\nAnd there is clearly also anger and disillusionment, some of it driven by Trump's contentious personal brand of politics. Hence the protests, where 22-year-old college student Kim Sol-yi was carrying a banner depicting a cartoon Trump vomiting money.\n\n\"When he called South Korea a 'money machine' that really angered me,\" she said. \"It seems the US is seeing and treating South Korea as its cash cow – plain and simple – asking for huge investments. Honestly, it makes me pretty mad and question whether the US even thinks of us as an equal partner.\"\n\nAnd yet South Koreans' views of the US appear to be largely positive. Nearly nine out of 10 view the US as their most important ally, according to a poll taken earlier this year by the US-based Pew Research Centre. But the survey happened before the raids in Georgia.\n\nThat poll was not so favourable towards South Korea's other superpower guest this week: China, whom a third of respondents viewed as their country's biggest threat.\n\n\"I came out here today out of love for South Korea, to protect South Korea,\" said 27-year-old Park Da-som, who was at the other protest, rallying against China.\n\n\"I feel that the Republic of Korea is gradually being overtaken by Chinese influences,\" she adds, but with a pragmatic caveat.\n\n\"Of course, I believe we should maintain a certain level of favourable diplomatic relations with China. What we dislike is the CCP - the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nAnti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has grown steadily since 2016 when Seoul agreed to deploy an advanced US missile defence system in the country, which prompted economic retaliation from a furious Beijing. There are also historic grievances and theirs has always been an uneasy relationship.\n\nBut the mistrust has intensified on the right in a country divided  by Yoon's impeachment. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about Yoon being a victim of election fraud.\n\nWhile tens of thousands demanded his removal from office, his supporters, far smaller in number but vociferous, opposed his impeachment – even now a fringe group of conservatives regularly call for his return. They are also the ones rallying against China.\n\n\"Korea for Koreans\" read the banners at the weekend protests, along with signs calling on the government to \"Stop the Chinese Boats\". One café  is facing criticism after posting online that it would refuse to serve Chinese customers.\n\nSuch instances have led to allegations of racism but Soo-bin, 27, who was at the protests, disagreed: \"We value democratic freedom and the free market economy. We want a Republic of Korea where all freedom - freedom of association, assembly, religion, expression - are protected. That is why we stand here.\"\n\nObservers say this is a minority view, represented by a small part of the Korean electorate. Yet it it's hard to deny that there has been a small surge in anti-Chinese rhetoric recently after President Lee eased visa rules for Chinese tourist groups.\n\nLee has tried to curb the protests by introducing a bill banning rallies that promote hatred or discrimination. And long known for his openness to pursue stronger ties with China, he has made it clear that's what he intends to do in office.\n\nXi Jinping is set to meet Lee one-on-one on Saturday during what is his first visit to South Korea in 11 years, despite it being a short hop from Beijing.\n\n\"If President Lee can deliver on the economic side, everyone will give him a pass, except for what is ultimately a pretty fringe position on what you could say is the far-right,\" Mr Delury says. \"President Lee is really governing more toward the centre, and the centre of Korea wants to get along with China.\"\n\nXi arrives on Thursday and, after meeting Trump, he is spending three days in the ancient capital of Gyeongju with other leaders attending the APEC summit. He is spending more time in South Korea than Trump, which is a huge diplomatic opportunity as he seeks to present China as the more stable trading partner and global power.\n\nA better relationship with Beijing – ties soured under Yoon, who was seen as hawkish towards China – could also help President Lee start a conversation with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\n\nThis is also a dialogue that he and his Democratic Party have pushed for – the earlier historic summits between Trump and Kim also happened with the help of a South Korean leader from the same party.\n\nCould that happen this time? The US president has said he wants to talk, but there has been no reply from Pyongyang.\n\nKim aside, this is a big week for South Korea and Lee. It's hard to miss America's influence on the country, from music to religion, but South Korea is now a wealthy, soft-power giant with a voice of its own.\n\nThe streets bustle with westerners in traditional Korean Hanbok hunting for merchandise from the Netflix hit K-pop Demon Hunters or queuing in K-beauty shops for the hottest new face masks. The economy has been picking up speed again.\n\nHowever Lee chooses to navigate between the world's two biggest economies, it's hard to imagine how he can afford to alienate either."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z7xx6nr4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"00:06:25.683+00:00","title":"BBC investigation exposes dangerous teeth-whitening industry","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A BBC North West investigation has revealed that illegal teeth-whitening treatments — using hydrogen peroxide levels up to 53% — are being sold and administered by unqualified beauticians through social media and door-to-door delivery.

2025-10-29T00:06:25.683+00:00\n\nTitle: BBC investigation exposes dangerous teeth-whitening industry     \n\nIllegal teeth-whitening treatments that can burn gums and destroy teeth are being handed over in car parks and on doorsteps, a BBC investigation has found.\n\nSome gels, containing more than 500 times the legal limit of bleaching agent for over-the-counter products, are sold blatantly on social media.\n\nAs part of the investigation, a BBC North West reporter was able to obtain a fraudulent teeth-whitening qualification, as well as being given \"extreme\" bleach and advised to \"practise on friends and family\".\n\nThe British Dental Association (BDA) said it was \"appalled\" by the BBC's findings.\n\nIn one case, a seller boasted that there are \"insane\" profits to be made from providing the treatments.\n\nIn the UK, treatments using teeth-whitening products containing more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide can only be carried out by dentists and other professionals registered with the General Dental Council (GDC).\n\nAnd products used in treatments offered by dentists cannot contain more than 6% hydrogen peroxide.\n\nHowever, products sold to undercover BBC reporters were sent to a laboratory for tests where results showed they contained hydrogen peroxide levels of up to 53%.\n\nKellie Howson, 54, who lost four teeth after she paid £65 for a whitening treatment at a beauty salon in Lancaster, urged the public to be aware of the dangers.\n\nShe said: \"I just remember not long into the treatment my gums starting to really hurt, and afterwards it just got worse and worse.\n\n\"I was in agony.\"\n\nMrs Howson, who works in a hospital, was told by her dentist that the gel had caused irreparable damage and only the removal of four teeth would stop the pain.\n\nThe grandmother said it had taken years and tens of thousands of pounds to repair some of the damage done by the hydrogen peroxide treatment, which she got in 2015.\n\n\"It destroyed my confidence, I didn't want to go out, didn't want to see anyone,\" she said.\n\n\"I just don't think there's enough knowledge about this. You go on social media and see so many offers.\"\n\nThe beautician who carried out Mrs Howson's treatment was prosecuted for unlawfully practising dentistry and was ordered to pay £250 compensation.\n\nThe BBC's North West investigation began after the team was contacted by a beautician concerned about how widespread the use of illegal treatments was in the region.\n\nIt did not take long to uncover evidence of kits containing levels of chemicals far beyond the legal safe limits being advertised and sold online by other beauticians in the Manchester and Merseyside areas.\n\nSome of the gels were advertised as containing \"extreme bleach\" and boasted that they were \"so strong it's not available to buy in the UK\".\n\nA BBC undercover journalist approached salons and agreed to meet and purchase the whitening kits.\n\nWhite n Bright in Droylsden, Manchester, advertised kits containing 35% carbamide peroxide, a bleaching agent which, at that strength, breaks down into approximately 12% hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThat level is 120 times the legal limit that can be used in cosmetic treatments by non-dentists, and twice the strength that dentists can legally use.\n\nThe company owner - who sold the kits for £55 - claimed on social media that the business offered \"advanced teeth-whitening\" and described the treatment as \"safe and non-sensitive\".\n\nWhen the BBC's reporter went to collect the kit, she was handed two syringes of \"whitening gel\" in a plastic sandwich bag on the doorstep of the seller's home by someone understood to be a relative of the seller.\n\nThere were no instructions for use and no safety advice was given.\n\nOn Merseyside, the BBC found a beautician advertising illegal whitening products and training courses for fraudulent qualifications.\n\nPearly White Diamonds was charging £300 for an online training course including a kit containing \"high\" and \"extreme\" hydrogen peroxide gels, described as up to 35% and up to 53% in strength.\n\nThe company owner directed the BBC's reporter to meet her in the car park of a retirement home to collect the kit.\n\nBefore this meeting, the owner messaged the undercover reporter and said: \"Are you aware the rules have changed who can whiten teeth? In 2012 it changed from anyone to dentist only… however as you will be aware everyone's still doing it anyway.\"\n\nThe company boss said the rule change \"doesn't make a difference, to be honest\".\n\nIn the car park, she handed over three pink sparkly party bags containing unlabelled gels, a pre-signed teeth whitening-qualification and a set of plastic teeth to practise on.\n\nOver the following days, the company boss provided a \"training course\" in the form of a series of messages sent via WhatsApp.\n\nThe instructions, which were provided over three messages, gave advice on where to apply the gel, patient safety and satisfaction.\n\nThe company owner advised to \"practise on friends and family\" after reading the instructions.\n\n\"Once you're all settled, I can then pass you over to my dental manufacturer to brand your own teeth-whitening products. It's really cheap to do and the profit is insane,\" she said.\n\nThe BBC also found a Wirral beautician who had undertaken one of the training courses offered by Pearly White Diamonds.\n\nThe owner of Hannah Louise Aesthetics posted a picture of a certificate similar to the one received by the BBC reporter.\n\nThe beautician used it to claim she was qualified to treat clients and take bookings.\n\nThe company also posted advertisements offering teeth-whitening treatments using \"extreme\" strength gels, as well as \"hybrid gels\" advertised as containing 22% hydrogen peroxide and 22% carbamide peroxide.\n\nWhite n Bright, Pearly White Diamonds and Hannah Louise Aesthetics did not respond when approached by the BBC for comment.\n\nSince 2016, anyone using above the legal hydrogen peroxide limit can face an unlimited fine and a criminal record in England and Wales.\n\nBut investigations rely on customers coming forward, and the last successful prosecution brought by the GDC was in October 2021.\n\n\"The GDC's investigations are reactive, rather than proactive, in line with our statutory remit and objectives,\" a GDC spokesman said.\n\nThe regulator said in recent years the focus has been on \"education, engagement and encouraging compliance in the first instance\".\n\nThe kits purchased by the BBC were tested in a laboratory at the University of Lancashire.\n\nThe tests confirmed that the gels did contain the advertised levels of hydrogen and carbamide peroxide.\n\nDr Shalini Kanagasingam, from the University of Lancashire, said: \"If you use a higher percentage, especially if it's not monitored professionally by a dentist, you could end up causing irreversible damage to a tooth and you could actually cause a chemical burn.\"\n\nDr Kanagasingam, who oversaw the tests at the university's school of medicine and dentistry, described the gels bought by the BBC as \"extremely dangerous\".\n\nShe added: \"I can absolutely understand why someone would want whiter teeth. It's something people aspire to nowadays.\n\n\"But I would always recommend that the public go to their dentist first, because it could be just a matter of getting a good clean, scale and polish rather than opting for bleaching agents, and especially bleaching agents at such high levels.\"\n\nThe BDA urged the government to launch an urgent crackdown.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We're horrified that so called 'training' is being offered via social media, and syringes of 50% concentration of hydrogen peroxide are being sold in car parks.\n\n\"The risk must seem worth the reward to these fraudsters.\"\n\nA government spokesman urged the public to \"contact Citizens Advice or their local authority Trading Standards department\" if they had concerns over teeth-whitening products for sale in their area.\n\nRead more stories from  Cheshire ,  Lancashire ,  Greater Manchester  and  Merseyside  on the BBC, watch  BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer  and follow  BBC North West on X .\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

killings in the key Sudanese city of el-Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured it from government forces.\n\nIn a address on Monday evening, Sudan's military chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he had approved the withdrawal of troops in response to the \"systematic destruction and killing of civilians\".\n\nThe UN said there were credible reports of \"summary executions\", while Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab referred to satellite imagery of \"piles of bodies executed en masse\".\n\nThe RSF has denied accusations of killing civilians and targeting non-Arab ethnic groups, despite evidence presented by the UN and human rights organisations.\n\nThe fall of el-Fasher in the Darfur region could mark a significant turning point in Sudan's civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people since April 2023.\n\nRSF fighters had been besieging el-Fasher for 18 months, trapping hundreds of thousands of civilians in the city and sparking a hunger crisis.\n\nYale University's Humanitarian Research Lab told the BBC that since the city was captured, satellite images had shown \"piles of bodies executed en masse, or shot by snipers attempting to breach\" the city's perimeter wall.\n\nAnd in a post on X, the research group's executive director described his shock at being able to see \"apparent pools of blood\" via satellite imagery.\n\n\"The horror, scale, and velocity of killing happening now [is] unlike anything I've ever seen in a quarter century of doing this work,\" Nathaniel Raymond said.\n\nSimilarly, a UN humanitarian team in Sudan said it was \"horrified\" by reports of atrocities like \"summary executions\", attacks on civilians along escape routes, sexual violence and house-to-house raids.\n\nThe Joint Force, an alliance of Darfuri armed groups supporting the military, said 2,000 civilians had been killed since the city fell. There is no independent confirmation of this.\n\nMeanwhile, residents who managed to flee el-Fasher have told the BBC they are fearful and distressed after losing contact with relatives still stuck in the city.\n\nOne man said several of his relatives were \"massacred\", but he has not been able to contact any surviving members of his family as communication lines have been cut since the RSF took over.\n\n\"They were gathered in one place and all killed. Now we have no idea what has happened to those who are still alive,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Union said it wanted \"all warring parties to de-escalate\" the conflict, while the African Union condemned \"alleged war crimes and ethnically targeted killings of civilians\".\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said the only hospital still functioning, albeit partially, in el-Fasher was attacked on Sunday.\n\nA nurse was reportedly killed in the assault, it added.\n\nUN head António Guterres said he was \"gravely concerned\" over the   current situation in the city, and condemned the reported \"violations of international humanitarian law\".\n\nOn Monday, after confirming the army had withdrawn from el-Fasher, Sudanese military chief Gen Burhan denounced inaction by the international community to end the RSF's atrocities and vowed to fight \"until this land is purified\".\n\n\"We can turn the tables every time, and we can return every land desecrated by these traitors to the nation's fold,\" he said.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/politics/third-term-limit.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:35:37.926Z","title":"Trump Suggests He Knows He Can’t Run Again: ‘It’s Too Bad’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has publicly acknowledged that he is constitutionally ineligible to run for a third term due to the 22nd Amendment, expressing that it is 'too bad' he cannot seek re-election in 2028.

So we’ll see what happens.”\n\nThe remarks came after House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday there was no path around the Constitution’s two-term limit.\n\n“I don’t see a way to amend the Constitution — I don’t see the path for that,” Mr. Johnson said — but not before complimenting the “Trump 2028” cap that the president likes to wear and display in the Oval Office, and noting that it was still fun to entertain the idea.\n\nMr. Trump, asked about Mr. Johnson’s conclusion, which the speaker said he had discussed with the president, said he didn’t “want to talk about it” before listing accomplishments, such as resolving several conflicts and rising stock prices, that he said made him the ideal candidate.\n\nSince retaking the White House, Mr. Trump has repeatedly teased that he may never leave. For several months, Mr. Trump has discussed serving a third term, vacillating between joking to goad his critics and signaling that it would be one of many ways he would seek to test the bounds of his constitutional authority.\n\nJust this week, Mr. Trump said, “I would love to do it,” when asked about serving another four years.\n\nAsked on Wednesday whether he had been “trolling” or serious about serving, Mr. Trump indicated that he had come to terms with the 22nd Amendment, which states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice,” regardless of whether the terms are consecutive. .\n\n“If you read it, it’s pretty clear — I’m not allowed to run,” he said. “It’s too bad.”\n\nLast week, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former strategist, said vaguely that there was “a plan” to help the president get elected to a third term.\n\n“Trump is going to be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” he said.\n\nMr. Trump’s allies have floated the possibility of finding a legal loophole, such as a scenario in which Mr. Trump runs on a ticket as vice president and ascends to the presidency once elected.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said that although it would be legal for him to do that, he wouldn’t want to. “I would rule that out, because it’s too cute,” he said. “I think the people wouldn’t like that.”\n\nMr. Trump has said that the Republican Party has other great candidates, and has floated the notion of his vice president, JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio running together on a ticket.\n\nAnnie Karni contributed reporting from Washington.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/us-attorney-bill-essayli-los-angeles-ruling.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"22:14:01-04:00","title":"Federal Judge Disqualifies Trump-Backed Prosecutor in Los Angeles","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Hawaii has disqualified Bill Essayli, a Trump-appointed acting U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, ruling that he lacks legal standing due to the absence of proper congressional or judicial confirmation.

The order was issued by Judge J. Michael Seabright of the Federal District Court in Hawaii, who ruled that the Trump appointee, Bill Essayli, “is not lawfully serving as acting United States Attorney” and “cannot continue to perform any role” that job entails.\n\nBut it was unclear what the practical effect of his order would be, since the judge also allowed Mr. Essayli to revert to the role of the office’s top deputy, as the first assistant United States attorney.\n\nThe judge, an appointee of George W. Bush, said he shared concerns expressed by lawyers who had challenged Mr. Essayli’s status that the result was “little remedy at all” and agreed that the Department of Justice was effectively circumventing the intent of the law. But he said he was constrained “to apply the statutes as written.”\n\nThe judge also did not dismiss the three criminal cases being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney’s office in which defense lawyers had argued that Mr. Essayli lacked legal standing to prosecute. And while Mr. Essayli could not supervise the cases as the head of the office, the judge ruled, he could supervise them as the office’s top deputy.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Essayli could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration’s strategy of forgoing congressional approval has clouded the legitimacy of several prominent regional offices of the Department of Justice. Three federal judges have now rejected attempts by the administration to retain federal prosecutors on an “acting” basis, without Senate or judicial confirmation, after their initial 120-day terms expired. A fourth challenge was brought last week by James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, who has asserted in court filings that Lindsey Halligan, a prosecutor Mr. Trump put in place in Virginia, was improperly appointed.\n\nAnd California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office confirmed on Tuesday that the governor had hired one of the federal prosecutors purged by the Trump administration, Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento.\n\nLast month, a federal judge disqualified Nevada’s top federal prosecutor, Sigal Chattah, from handling four cases, saying that she was “not validly serving as acting U.S. attorney” and that her involvement in cases “would be unlawful.” Challenges have since arisen in other federal cases brought in that state. In August, a different judge ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Mr. Trump, had been serving as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney without legal authority. Both decisions have been appealed.\n\nMr. Essayli and Ms. Chattah had initially been appointed “interim” U.S. attorneys. Interim appointments expire after 120 days, but in late July, the Trump administration extended their terms by naming them both acting U.S. attorneys. Permanent U.S. attorney appointments typically require approval either by the U.S. Senate or by federal judges in the affected district.\n\nIn a hearing on Mr. Essayli’s situation in Los Angeles earlier this month, lawyers debated the fine points of laws dictating the rules for appointments, which are not always straightforward. Alexander Robbins, an assistant U.S. attorney, argued that “it’s pretty clear that Mr. Essayli legitimately works here, like I do and like all the other A.U.S.A.s in this office.”\n\nPublic defenders in Nevada and California have led the challenges but have not discussed them publicly. But they have been joined by other lawyers who have.\n\n“They are trying to get around congressional oversight,” Mark Windsor, one of the private lawyers challenging Mr. Essayli’s appointment on behalf of a client, said during the hearing in Los Angeles. “I don’t think that this court can avoid the conclusion that this really is an intentional, knowing, deliberate attempt to circumvent some of the key safeguards within our Constitution and that it deserves the most extreme remedy that this court can fashion in order to deter that conduct,” he added.\n\nThe case is likely to be appealed along with the others. In remarks during the court hearing, Judge Seabright said that “no matter what” he ruled, the case would inevitably end up before a higher court.\n\nMr. Essayli, a former state assemblyman who once worked as an assistant U.S. attorney, is a Trump ally who has been far more outspoken on political issues than have many of his predecessors. In social media posts, he has criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, both Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News, he said that many state lawmakers appeared to have “a disease in the mind” and “want soft-on-crime policies.”\n\nHe ramped up an investigation of California high school sports after a transgender girl qualified for three events at the state track and field championships.\n\nAnd he has played a high-profile role in the administration’s response to protests surrounding immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. In June, after a prominent union leader was injured during an arrest while protesting the raids, Mr. Essayli said, “I don’t care who you are — if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/senate-vote-trump-brazil-tariffs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:21:19-04:00","title":"With Some G.O.P.

Backing, Senate Votes to End Trump’s Brazil Tariffs\n\nPublished: 2025-10-28T20:21:19-04:00\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday voted to terminate the 50 percent tariffs that President Trump has imposed on Brazil, with a handful of Republicans crossing party lines to help push through a measure rejecting the emergency declaration used to justify them.\n\nWhile the resolution faces long odds in the House, where Republicans have taken extraordinary steps to make it more difficult to bring up such measures, the vote signaled bipartisan frustration with the president’s tariffs on most goods from Brazil, a country with which the United States has a multibillion-dollar trade surplus.\n\nThe resolution is one of three that Democrats have planned to bring up for a vote this week to challenge Mr. Trump’s moves to circumvent Congress and wage a trade war that many lawmakers are concerned will harm their constituents. Votes are expected in the next few days on tariffs the president imposed on Canada and a global tariff rate on more than 100 trading partners.\n\nThe vote on Tuesday was 52 to 48 to end the levies on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to pass the resolution.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and the lead sponsor of the measures, said the votes are as much about the president’s overreach of power as they are about the economic impact of his sweeping tariffs.\n\n“Are we just going to allow the trade power which is handed to Congress, or the war power which is handed to Congress, or the appropriations power which is handed to Congress, or the nominations advice and consent power which is handed to the Senate — are we just going to allow those powers to be taken over by this president or any president?” Mr. Kaine said.\n\nThe resolution that advanced Tuesday and the two additional measures expected later this week would terminate emergency declarations that Mr. Trump made, relying on a Cold War-era law, to justify his tariffs, and in doing so, eliminate his power to enforce them.\n\n“Emergencies are like war, famine, tornado,” said Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the sole Republican sponsor of the resolution rejecting the tariffs on Brazil in Mr. Trump’s trade war. “Not liking someone’s tariffs is not an emergency. It’s an abuse of the emergency power, and it’s Congress abdicating their traditional role in taxes.”\n\nJoining Mr. Paul in supporting the measure were four other G.O.P. senators who have expressed concern that the tariffs could cause economic pain in the United States: Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\n“Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement. The former Republican leader said he planned to vote for additional resolutions to curb Mr. Trump’s tariffs expected to be voted on in the coming days.\n\nMr. Tillis indicated on Tuesday before the vote that he probably would only support the measure on the tariffs on Brazil.\n\n“I’ve had a big concern with the Brazil one in particular, since we have a trade surplus with them. That’s the only one I’m considering,” Mr. Tillis said. He opposed a similar attempt to rescind tariffs on Canada in April.\n\nAsked before the vote why more of his Republican colleagues were not willing to support the measure, Mr. Paul answered: “Fear.”\n\nPast presidents have used the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to punish human rights violators and rogue states. But in the case of Brazil, the tariffs are primarily based on politics. Mr. Trump strongly opposes the Brazilian government’s prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, his ally who is accused of plotting a coup after he lost the last presidential election.\n\n“The prosecution of a friend of the president — how is that an emergency that threatens the United States? It doesn’t,” Mr. Kaine said.\n\nSeveral Republicans who opposed the resolution said the effort to rein in the president’s tariffs amounted to nothing but showmanship on the Senate floor.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, said the bill was “more of a political design than it is a substantive approach.”\n\nSenator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said he would vote against all three tariff resolutions this week because he supports the president’s attempt to “level the playing field for our exporters.”\n\n“And in the short term, of course, there’s bumps and it’s difficult, but the idea is to ultimately get better trade terms,” Mr. Hoeven said.\n\nBut even Republicans who voted against the resolution showed signs of concern over the impact of the tariffs on their states.\n\nSoybean exporters have been hit hard by the Trump administration’s retaliatory tariffs on China. Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said that if Mr. Trump in his meeting this week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping “can actually pull off a big trade deal with China that involves the sale of soybeans, all will be forgiven.”\n\nRobert Jimison and Carl Hulse contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz913gxlw3jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:34:47.937+00:00","title":"How climate change affects hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"While climate change is not expected to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones globally, it is significantly increasing their intensity.

2025-10-29T07:34:47.937+00:00\n\nTitle: How climate change affects hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones\n\nHurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, created \"extremely dangerous and life-threatening\" conditions in Jamaica, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nClimate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.\n\nBut warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense.\n\nThat can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.\n\nHurricanes are powerful storms which develop in warm tropical ocean waters.\n\nIn other parts of the world, they are known as cyclones or typhoons. Collectively, these storms are referred to as \"tropical cyclones\".\n\nTropical cyclones are characterised by very high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and  storm surges  - short-term rises to sea-levels. This often causes widespread damage and flooding.\n\nHurricanes can be categorised by their peak sustained wind speed.\n\nMajor hurricanes are rated category three and above, meaning they reach at least 111mph (178km/h).\n\nHurricanes, typhoons and cyclones begin as atmospheric  disturbances  - such as, for example, a tropical wave, an area of low pressure where thunderstorms and clouds develop.\n\nAs warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, winds begin to spin. The process is linked to how the Earth's rotation affects winds in tropical regions just away from the equator.\n\nFor a hurricane to develop and keep spinning, the sea surface generally needs to be at least 27C to provide enough energy, and the winds need to not vary much with height.\n\nIf all these factors come together, an intense hurricane can form, although the exact causes of individual storms are complex.\n\nGlobally, the frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased over the past century, and in fact the  number may have fallen  - although long-term data is limited in some regions.\n\nBut it is \"likely\" that a higher proportion of tropical cyclones across the globe have reached category three or above over the past four decades, meaning they reach the highest wind speeds, according to the UN's climate body,  the IPCC .\n\nThe IPCC quotes \"medium confidence\" that there has been an increase in the average and peak rainfall rates associated with tropical cyclones.\n\nThe frequency and magnitude of  \"rapid intensification events\" in the Atlantic has also likely increased . This is where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly, which can be especially dangerous.\n\nThere also seems to have been a  slowdown in the speed at which tropical cyclones move  across the Earth's surface. This typically brings more rainfall for a given location. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey \"stalled\" over Houston, releasing  100cm of rain in three days .\n\nIn some places, the average location where tropical cyclones reach their peak intensity has shifted poleward - for example the  western North Pacific . This can expose new communities to these hazards.\n\nAnd there is  some evidence  the increased intensity of US hurricanes means they are causing more damage.\n\nAssessing the precise influence of climate change on individual tropical cyclones can be challenging due to the complexity of these storm systems.\n\nBut rising temperatures can affect these storms in several ways.\n\nFirstly, warmer ocean waters mean storms can pick up more energy, leading to higher wind speeds.\n\nMaximum wind speeds of hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 were boosted by an estimated 19mph (30km/h) on average as a result of human-driven ocean warming,  according to a recent study .\n\nSecondly, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall.\n\nClimate change made the extreme rainfall from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 around three times more likely,  according to one estimate.\n\nFinally, sea-levels are rising, mainly due to a combination of  melting glaciers  and  ice sheets , and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. Local factors can also play a part. This means storm surges happen on top of already elevated sea levels,  worsening coastal flooding .\n\nFor example, it is estimated that flood heights from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - one of America's deadliest storms - were  15-60%  higher than they would have been in the climate conditions of 1900.\n\nOverall,  the IPCC concludes  that there is \"high confidence\" that humans have contributed to increases in precipitation associated with tropical cyclones, and \"medium confidence\" that humans have contributed to the higher probability of a tropical cyclone being more intense.\n\nThe number of tropical cyclones globally is unlikely to increase, according to  the IPCC .\n\nBut as the world warms, it says it is \"very likely\" they will have higher rates of rainfall and reach higher top wind speeds. This means a higher proportion would reach the most intense categories, four and five.\n\nThe more global temperatures rise, the more extreme these changes will tend to be.\n\nThe proportion of tropical cyclones reaching category four and five may increase by around 10% if global temperature rises are limited to 1.5C, increasing to 13% at 2C and 20% at 4C, the IPCC says - although the exact numbers are uncertain."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drjx9r0l8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"00:35:51.763+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa: 'We are all terrified,' witnesses say in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to hit Jamaica in modern history and the strongest globally in 2025, made landfall near New Hope on Tuesday with wind speeds of 185 mph, causing widespread destruction, power outages, and fear among residents and tourists.

Instead, it fired missiles off its west coast, the country’s state media reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe weapons test, conducted on Tuesday, took place a day before Mr. Trump was scheduled to arrive in South Korea. On Wednesday, he is set to attend an Asia-Pacific economic forum in the city of Gyeongju.\n\nDuring the test, sea-to-surface strategic cruise missiles flew for more than two hours before striking their target, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nThe report indicated that the missiles were designed to carry nuclear warheads. Pak Jong-chon, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that the test was an important success.\n\n“It is our responsible mission and duty to ceaselessly toughen the nuclear combat posture,” Mr. Pak said.\n\nThe launch was North Korea’s second missile test in a week. Last Wednesday, it fired what it called two hypersonic missiles from Pyongyang, its capital city, to a target on a plateau in the northeast of the country. The South Korean military identified them as short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nAlthough North Korea has conducted various missile tests in recent years, the latest test-launch drew attention in part because of its timing.\n\nWhile on his first trip to Asia since his return to the White House, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his eagerness to have a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Kim again. The two leaders met three times during Mr. Trump’s first term, but their direct diplomacy did not produce a deal on rolling back North Korea’s nuclear weapons program or easing international sanctions placed on the country.\n\n“I’d love to meet with him if he’d like to meet,” Mr. Trump said on Monday, when asked if he would meet with Mr. Kim. “If he wants to meet, I’ll be in South Korea.”\n\nThe last time the two men met, it took a little more than 30 hours for their governments to arrange a meeting on the border between North and South Korea. But this time, North Korea has not responded. It has said it will not reopen dialogue with Washington unless it is accepted as a nuclear weapons power.\n\nIn the past couple of years, North Korea has drawn closer to Russia. It has supplied Russia with weapons and troops to aid its war against Ukraine. Moscow has reciprocated by providing North Korea with food, oil, weapons technologies and a mutual defense treaty. The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have given Mr. Kim more diplomatic leverage in dealing with Washington.\n\nAs Mr. Trump prepared to visit South Korea, Mr. Kim sent his foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, to Moscow. After she met with her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Monday, the two nations issued a press statement reaffirming “their will to accelerate the multifaceted development of the bilateral relations.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/world/asia/trump-xi-china-industrial-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"02:02:42-04:00","title":"Ahead of Trump-Xi Meeting, China Doubles Down on Tech Ambitions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahead of a pivotal diplomatic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, China has unveiled a comprehensive five-year strategy (2026–2030) to strengthen its technological and industrial base.

Ambitions\n\nPublished: 2025-10-29T02:02:42-04:00\n\nDays before meeting President Trump in South Korea, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping laid out the next stage in a strategy of long-term competition with the United States and the West that centers on securing a global lead in advanced manufacturing and technology.\n\nThe plan makes clear that Beijing wants to double down on industrial and technological strength even as its trading partners worry that China’s expanding exports are undercutting their own industries.\n\nChina must “seize the window of opportunity to consolidate and expand our strengths, break past bottlenecks and surmount weaknesses, to gain the strategic initiative in intense international competition,” Mr. Xi told the party’s Central Committee — its council of several hundred senior officials — last week, according to a statement that was released Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump is trying to use punishing tariffs to press manufacturers of vehicles, electronics and other goods to shift from China to the United States. Other industrial economies, including Japan and South Korea, worry that China’s growing exports are squeezing their companies.\n\nMany economists have also urged China to devote much more spending to building a social safety net so its citizens have the confidence to spend more. But an outline of China’s next five-year plan, covering 2026 to 2030, shows that Mr. Xi’s vision of national strength in the face of tough global competition remains focused on manufacturing and innovation, which he believes will bring more prosperity to the country’s people.\n\n“The balance of global power is undergoing profound readjustment, and breakthroughs in a new phase of technological revolution and industrial transformation are accelerating,” says the summary of the plan, which was approved by officials at the meeting.\n\n“Unilateralism and protectionism are raising their heads, and the threats from hegemony and power politics are escalating,” the document stated, using terms that in Chinese political speak allude to Western dominance.\n\nSuch five-year plans are an important tool for Chinese leaders to set out priorities and steer funds to them.\n\nThe plan says China will adopt “extraordinary measures” to pursue breakthroughs in key technologies such as semiconductors, high-end equipment and advanced materials. The document left unclear what “extraordinary measures” meant, but the words conveyed the urgency behind the Chinese leaders’ plans, said Gerard DiPippo, an associate director of the RAND China Research Center who studies the country’s economy.\n\n“In policy terms, ‘extraordinary measures’ means stepping outside normal bureaucratic and market routines to force breakthroughs in choke-point technologies,” Mr. DiPippo wrote by email. “It reflects Beijing’s mobilization mind-set given the urgency of geopolitical tensions.”\n\nMr. Xi is scheduled to meet Mr. Trump on Thursday for talks focused on defusing their trade tensions, including over U.S. tariffs and China’s sweeping export controls on rare earths, which are used in many advanced technologies, commercial and military.\n\nMr. Xi and Mr. Trump may agree to a truce that includes pulling back U.S. tariffs and pausing China’s latest export controls. But the plan suggests that Beijing will continue working on using export controls to defend its economic and security interests.\n\nThe Chinese government “will improve export control and security review mechanisms,” it says. A section on national security goals also noted that China would “enhance the exploration, development and creation of reserves of strategic mineral resources.”\n\nThe plan says that China will do more to expand domestic consumption, and calls for “a marked increase” in household spending and a “sustained strengthening of domestic demand as a primary driver of economic growth.”\n\nBut China’s strategy for expanding consumer spending differed from the approach that some Western economists support, which puts a priority on greater spending for health care and other welfare outlays, so that people have more money and confidence to purchase goods and services, Mr. DiPippo said.\n\nTo Chinese leaders, the country is unable to spur domestic consumption not from a lack of money for spending but because “the services aren’t of sufficient quality to meet their demands,” he said.\n\n“This approach maps onto their top goal of building a modern industrial system,” Mr. DiPippo said. “For Beijing, strong consumption is an outcome to be achieved through improving the productive side of the economy.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/politics/utah-trump-homeless-campus.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:02:03-04:00","title":"In Utah, Trump’s Vision for Homelessness Begins to Take Shape","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Utah is implementing a controversial plan to relocate up to 1,300 homeless individuals to a 16-acre site near Salt Lake City, combining services for addiction and mental illness with involuntary treatment and strict behavioral mandates.

Shape\n\nPublished: 2025-10-29T05:02:03-04:00\n\nTo glimpse the future of homelessness policy in the age of President Trump, consider 16 acres of scrubby pasture on the outskirts of Salt Lake City where the state plans to place as many as 1,300 homeless people in what supporters call a services campus and critics deem a detention camp.\n\nState planners say the site, announced last month after a secretive search, will treat addiction and mental illness and provide a humane alternative to the streets, where afflictions often go untreated and people die at alarming rates.\n\nThey also vow stern measures to move unhoused people to the remote site and force many of them to undergo treatment, reflecting a nationwide push by some conservatives for a new approach to homelessness, one embraced and promoted by Mr. Trump.\n\nWith outdoor sleeping banned, removal to the edge of town may become the only way some homeless Utahns can avoid jail. Planners say the facility will also hold hundreds of mentally ill homeless people under court-ordered civil commitment and the effort will include an “accountability center” for those with addictions.\n\n“An accountability center is involuntary, OK — you’re not coming in and out,” Randy Shumway, chairman of the state Homeless Services Board, said in an interview. Utah will end a harmful “culture of permissiveness,” he said, and guide homeless people “towards human thriving.”\n\nWhile the Utah effort began before Mr. Trump’s return to office, it mirrors his pledge to move the homeless from urban cores to “tent cities” with services. And it accelerated after Mr. Trump issued an executive order in July, calling for strict camping bans and expanded power to involuntarily treat homeless people.\n\nGov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, quickly praised Mr. Trump’s order and told Utah planners to follow it.\n\nCritics of the new plan say that confining people to a site on the city’s outskirts threatens civil liberties and warn that the promised services may not materialize. The efforts coincide with deep cuts to Medicaid, which could thwart the project’s financing.\n\n“I’m super anxious about it,” said Jen Plumb, a physician and Democratic state senator who calls the promise of high-quality medical care “pie in the sky.”\n\nUtah already has a severe shortage of psychiatric beds, she noted. The legislature is unlikely to fund hundreds of new beds, she said, and even if it did, there is no work force to staff them.\n\nWithout enormous new spending, she said, the center could function less as a treatment facility than “a prison or a warehouse.”\n\nThe emerging portrait of the Utah center, scheduled to open in 2027, brings to life a vow that Mr. Trump made two years ago in an extraordinary campaign video.\n\nAccusing homeless people of turning great cities into “unsanitary nightmares,” he pledged “to use every tool, lever and authority to get the homeless off our streets.” He said the administration would “open up large parcels of inexpensive land” where “dangerously deranged” people “can be relocated and their problems identified.”\n\nMuch about Utah’s plans remain unclear, including the details of involuntary treatment, what a proposal calls “work-conditioned housing” and whether the residents will sleep in buildings or tents. But supporters call it a model.\n\n“Utah is a harbinger of the future,” said Devon Kurtz of the Cicero Institute, a conservative policy group that has pushed for the changes in Utah and at the federal level.\n\nThe national push for stern measures follows a decade in which unsheltered homelessness grew nearly 60 percent, according to federal data — a result of factors that include spiking rents and untreated mental illness and substance abuse.\n\nAs tent clusters and open-air drug use rose, so did calls for encampment bans. The move for stricter measures gained momentum last year after the Supreme Court ruled that authorities could ban camping even in places that lacked shelter space.\n\nAlthough Utah seems the clearest example of what Mr. Trump has in mind, other communities have used threats of arrest to move homeless people to designated areas.\n\nAs New Orleans prepared for this year’s Super Bowl, state police moved more than 120 people from downtown to a distant warehouse hastily converted for three months into a shelter.\n\nSan Diego enforces a camping ban punishable by arrest while designating two tent sites with a total of 800 beds as an alternative to the street. But a recent lawsuit faults the sites for “inhumane” conditions, including rats, mold, and risks of fires and floods.\n\nIn Las Vegas, a $200 million homeless campus is under construction, with half of the money coming from the casino industry amid concerns that homelessness depresses tourism. It promises 900 beds across 26 acres with intensive services, and coincides with new prohibitions on sleeping in public, punishable by up to 10 days in jail.\n\nUtah’s plan is novel in that combines elements of a homeless shelter and a psychiatric hospital, sharply expanding involuntary treatment. Critics say it accelerates a disturbing shift toward coercion.\n\nAnd moving marginalized people to government camps, they say, is an idea with a long and shameful history.\n\n“It’s what they did in World War II in Japanese detention camps,” said Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center, a Washington advocacy group. “This reads similar to rounding up Jews or other people the Nazis didn’t like.”\n\nAsked in the confirmation process if he supported “relocation camps” for homeless people, Scott Turner, the housing secretary, did not reject the idea. “Our current approach to addressing homelessness is badly broken,” he wrote.\n\nUtah’s pivot is especially radical. It was once a leader in Housing First, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes permanent housing and offers treatment on a voluntary basis.\n\nHousing First has been the standard approach nationally for more than a decade, with studies showing it is effective in keeping people housed. But it is expensive and slow, and there is less evidence that it improves health outcomes.\n\nThe Utah plan returns to an earlier “treatment first” model that conditions aid on sobriety or compliance with psychiatric treatment. Celebrated by conservatives, such programs offer the hope of healing, but risk excluding people who cannot or will not comply.\n\nAs the planning for the facility got underway last year, the Republican-dominated legislature replaced the state’s homelessness planning board, which included many nonprofit providers, with a smaller body dominated by political appointees and business figures. It is led by Mr. Shumway, a Salt Lake City management consultant appointed to the role by Mr. Cox.\n\nIn an interview at his Salt Lake City office, Mr. Shumway, 53, toggled between the language of the boardroom and the pulpit. He said a “management consulting approach” would make homeless services more efficient (“we nerd out on things like Six Sigma and lean process re-engineering”), measuring individual progress through a system of behavioral targets he calls “the pathway to human thriving.”\n\n“Allowing people to remain on the streets originates from the purest of intentions and may be the most inhumane thing we could possibly do,” he said.\n\nAs Mr. Shumway describes it, nearly two-thirds of the 1,300 homeless people potentially sent to the site could be there for involuntary treatment. About 400 beds would be set aside for psychiatric treatment. Another 400 beds would provide substance abuse treatment “as an alternative to jail,” he said, with entry and exit “not voluntary.”\n\nAsked how people would enter the facility, he said law enforcement “rescue teams” would identify homeless people in the city and offer them a choice. “So we can take you to court, and you can go to jail,” he said. “We don’t want to do that. We have a resource-rich alternative.”\n\nThe plan shifts the state’s focus away from housing and toward rehabilitation and moral development. “Success is not permanent housing — success is human dignity,” Mr. Shumway said. “We are in the business of lives, of humans, of souls.”\n\n“We can’t brick-and-mortar our way out of this,” he said.\n\nMr. Shumway’s vision would require expanding civil commitment, the process by which a person can be forced to accept mental health treatment. Under Utah’s current law, a judge must find that an individual is dangerous or gravely disabled, and patients have the right to an attorney and to cross-examine witnesses.\n\nLowering the standard for civil commitment, as Mr. Trump called for in his executive order, would require state legislative action. No such action has been initiated in Utah, though Mr. Shumway said “the mechanics are being researched.”\n\nMr. Shumway allowed that planning was at an early stage, and many questions remained: What would happen to people who did not comply with the campus’s sobriety or treatment mandates? Would people who wished to leave be free to do so? Could sobriety requirements result in people losing subsidized housing and returning to homelessness?\n\n“You’re looking for granularity in a blue-sky conversation,” Mr. Shumway said. He said he had presented the plans to federal officials and “got very positive signals.”\n\nKasey Lovett, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said officials were aware of the Utah plan and were “encouraged” by its direction. Mr. Cox did not respond to an interview request.\n\nBut many Salt Lake City service providers expressed anxiety about the plan. The proposed site is near the airport, in a remote spot where pasture is gradually giving way to industrial warehouses. The nearest public bus stop is about two miles away, an hour’s walk over stretches of road that have no sidewalks.\n\n“What makes you think anybody’s going to stay there?” Ms. Plumb, the Democratic state senator, said. “Oh, excuse me — they don’t have the right to leave. That’s what is going to make them stay there.”\n\nAmong the biggest outstanding questions about the project is how to pay for it. Mr. Shumway has estimated $75 million in construction costs, followed by yearly operating costs of $34 million. Some of the costs might be trimmed by offering mental health care on an outpatient basis, through a federal clinic Mr. Shumway hopes to locate there.\n\nHe has also proposed redirecting about $17 million in federal homelessness grants now overseen by community groups and largely used for housing.\n\n“If you start fiddling with that money, you’re going to be pulling people out of housing into homelessness,” Josh Romney, son of the Republican former Senator Mitt Romney and the chair of Shelter the Homeless, a nonprofit organization that owns the city’s existing shelters, warned the services board last month.\n\nSome critics also see a conflict of interest in Mr. Shumway’s role as a government adviser and his firm’s promotion of software used in data collection and case management for homeless people. The services board has recommended that the software, called Know-by-Name, be adopted statewide.\n\nBill Tibbitts, who helps run a Utah food pantry called the Crossroads Urban Center, sent a letter to the governor and legislators this month highlighting the issue. “When he advocates for this use of taxpayer dollars, he is not a disinterested party,” the letter said.\n\nMr. Shumway called accusations of a conflict of interest “wholly inaccurate.” He said his firm had “a thriving homeless services consulting practice” that contracts with many cities and states. But the Know-By-Name system “is owned by a not-for-profit, is 100 percent funded by philanthropic donations, and has been developed solely for the state’s benefit.” No private entity is profiting, he said.\n\nOpposition to the planned site has been muted in this deeply red state, with the exception of neighboring landowners worried about crime and property values.\n\nNichole Solt, 46, owns three acres on the edge of the site, with four show horses and fields of hay and alfalfa. Recalling how she fell in love with the wild spot where her sons ride bikes and fish, Ms. Solt began to cry.\n\n“They tell me there’s going to be all this security, but the reality is they’re going to be in my backyard,” she said.\n\nFew of the unhoused people who were recently gathered in Salt Lake City’s Liberty Park had heard of the planned campus. Some said they saw an advantage to removing services from downtown neighborhoods where drug markets proliferate.\n\n“How do you stay clean when you’re surrounded by people you’ve been dirty with?” said Randy Zumwalt, 63.\n\nElizabeth Lowe, 36, had spread out a picnic blanket and was paging through a book about tarot readings. She said she had been living outside, on and off, for 15 years, and that friction with city dwellers had never been worse.\n\nShe was as weary of being stared at as they were weary of seeing her, she said. She said she wouldn’t mind living outside the city.\n\nBut when shown a rendering of the site, she was skeptical. “OK, so straight up, this reminds me of a concentration camp,” she said. “Trying to get all the homeless in one area by the airport. I mean — would we be able to leave of our own free will?”\n\nCertainly, the plan has captured the imagination of the governor.\n\nAt a homeless services conference in Salt Lake City this month, Mr. Cox singled out the planned campus as “one of the most significant steps forward in decades here in our state.” He called on his audience — a roomful of case managers and social workers — to “lean in and meet this moment with us.”\n\n“This is more than a facility,” he said. “It is a statement of who we are as a state.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/world/asia/trump-china-xi-opium-trade.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"00:01:15-04:00","title":"How the 19th-Century Opium War Shapes Xi’s Trade Clash With Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how the historical memory of the 19th-century Opium War — particularly Lin Zexu’s resistance to British opium smuggling — continues to influence China’s current foreign policy, especially in its trade rivalry with the United States under President Donald Trump.

He is celebrated today in Chinese textbooks and speeches by Mr. Xi as a national hero for standing up to Britain, the superpower of the day, in a confrontation over trade.\n\nThat confrontation, triggered by Lin’s efforts to halt opium smuggling, ended in disaster for China — a crushing military defeat that gave Britain control of Hong Kong and, in China’s telling, started a “century of humiliation,” a shameful stain whose removal President Xi has set as one of his most important goals since becoming China’s leader in 2012.\n\nPast shame looms large as Mr. Xi prepares for a meeting on Thursday in South Korea with President Trump, highlighting a gulf between the two leaders that stretches wider than their turbulent tiffs over tariffs, rare earth minerals and soybeans.\n\nPresident Trump “sees China as the winner of the international modern order, but Xi Jinping sees China as its victim,” said Julia Lovell, the author of The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams and the Making of Modern China, adding that these contrasting views can lead to “profound instability” in these talks.\n\n“I don’t know how much of a student of history Trump is, but it is very important that he understand the emotional importance of this history in China,” said Ms. Lovell, a China scholar at the University of London’s Birbeck College. “This history is shaping China’s actions and strategies in the here and now.”\n\nFor Mr. Xi, Lin’s legacy carries a dual message: China must never bow to foreign pressure, but it also must never again negotiate from a position of weakness. Lin’s defiant stand failed because Qing China lagged far behind the West in military and economic power. Mr. Xi’s strategy of pushing back against Mr. Trump suggests he believes China has finally accumulated the strength to succeed where Lin could not.\n\nCelebrating China’s resurgent power last month with a massive military parade in Beijing, he said from the rostrum of Tiananmen Gate that his country had “put an end to China’s national humiliation of suffering successive defeats at the hands of foreign aggressors in modern times.”\n\nBeijing has also bristled at what it sees as efforts by American leaders, including Mr. Trump, to cast China in the role of 19th-century Western opium traders with accusations that it is aggravating America’s drug problem by exporting chemicals used in the manufacture of fentanyl. Mr. Trump said last week that this would be his “first question” for Mr. Xi when they meet. China accuses Washington of using the drug problem to “blackmail” China.\n\nThe 19th-century showdown between China and the West began, much as today’s did, with mounting Western anger over a huge Chinese trade surplus. The country exported large quantities of tea, rhubarb, porcelain, silk and other goods but imported little in return.\n\nBritain turned to opium to narrow the gap, with Western merchants selling growing quantities of the drug to China despite an official ban on the narcotic declared in 1729.\n\nCommissioner Lin arrived in the southern port of Guangzhou, then known as Canton, in 1839, with orders from the emperor in Beijing to stop the opium trade and restore Qing dynasty finances, which had been upended by the outflow of silver to pay for drugs.\n\nLin’s determination to resist British power made him a heroic figure of resistance to Western bullying for generations of modern Chinese leaders since the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911.\n\nHe is best known in China for confiscating and then destroying foreign opium worth hundreds of millions of dollars at current prices in trenches dug on the bank of the Pearl River at Humen near Guangzhou. Foreigners who witnessed the destruction, Lin informed the emperor, “feel heartily ashamed.”\n\nChina’s public security minister, Wang Xiaohong, who has been at the center of arguments with Washington over fentanyl, this week visited Humen and a museum there celebrating Lin’s anti-drug actions in the 19th century. The minister, vowing to carry out “a victorious people’s war on drugs in the new era,” said all Chinese need to “uphold and carry forward the spirit of Lin Zexu.”\n\nMr. Xi has embraced the Qing official’s example with particular vigor, presiding during his 17 years in Fujian over the renovation of sites connected to Lin, including the house where he was born and his family’s memorial hall.\n\nThe hall is now a sprawling exhibition complex highlighting Western perfidy, Lin’s righteous defiance and what a carved stone in a leafy courtyard describes as “China’s incessant struggle against foreign aggression.” In keeping with Mr. Xi’s view that China needs to be open to the West but on its own terms, the exhibits also praise Lin for promoting Western science and technology as a way to strengthen China.\n\nLin’s birthplace in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian, has become the Bethlehem of modern Chinese nationalism, the small room in which he is said to have been born the centerpiece of a state-sponsored heritage trail feting his unyielding patriotic spirit.\n\n“I am so proud of my ancestor,” said Lin Yanyi, a seventh-generation descendant who works for the Lin Zexu Foundation, which manages the birthplace. She said he had never spurned “good things from the West” but always put China’s interests first.\n\nMao Linli, a Fuzhou historian and adviser to the foundation, said that the lesson from Lin’s showdown with Britain is clear: Never bend to foreign pressure or concede the moral high ground.\n\nHe said that were he alive today, Lin, who served in Guangzhou from 1839 to 1841, would never accept American demands. “He always stood on the side of right,” Mr. Mao said. “America started this fight, not China. America should stop it.”\n\nPresaging China’s current efforts to get Mr. Trump to relent on tariffs by tightly restricting exports of rare earth minerals crucial to modern manufacturing, Lin sought to exert pressure on Britain and other nations involved in the illegal opium trade by threatening to halt Chinese exports he thought were indispensable to the West.\n\nThe thinking in China, according to “The Opium War Through Chinese Eyes,” a classic book on the conflict based on Lin’s diaries and letters, was “that Britons would die of constipation without rhubarb and tea from China” and would quickly fold.\n\nIn a letter he drafted to Queen Victoria in 1839, Lin urged the British monarch to halt the opium trade, noting that the drug was also illegal in Britain. He warned that China could cut off exports of “things which your foreign countries could not exist a single day without.”\n\nSmugglers handed over more than 1,000 tons of opium but demanded compensation and balked at what they viewed as intrusive Chinese restrictions on legitimate commerce. They lobbied London to send gunboats.\n\nLin destroyed the confiscated drugs by mixing them with salt and lime near Guangzhou at Humen. He refused to pay compensation for the destroyed drugs.\n\nFar less dependent on Chinese rhubarb and far stronger militarily than Lin believed, Britain sent gunboats to the coast of China to attack Guangzhou and other Chinese port cities.\n\nYet China’s official recounting of this chapter of the Opium War focuses on praising Lin for his integrity and not on whether he overplayed China’s weak hand in negotiations with Britain, as some historians have suggested.\n\nAt a Lin Zexu-themed restaurant in the center of Fuzhou, Wang Yike, the 9-year-old son of the owner, serenaded lunchtime diners last week with patriotic verses celebrating the destruction of British opium in 1839 as an act that “lifted the righteousness of our nation.”\n\nThe boy, wearing the red scarf of China’s Young Pioneers, a communist youth group, chanted one of the commissioner’s best-known lines — from the poem Mr. Xi kept on his desk: “If it benefits the nation, I will live and die for it.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/weather/hurricane-melissa-caribbean-photos-video.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"17:31:35-04:00","title":"Scenes From the Caribbean as Hurricane Melissa Hits","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm with winds exceeding 185 mph, made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday, causing catastrophic damage including flooding, landslides, and widespread power outages.

The Israeli military said one of its soldiers, Master Sgt. Yona Efraim, had been killed in the Rafah attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, said “dozens of Hamas commanders” had been killed in strikes overnight. The military said the cease-fire resumed at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nHealth officials in Gaza said the Israeli strikes had killed at least 100 people in the enclave and injured around 250 more.\n\nMunir al-Bursh, director general of Gaza’s health ministry, whose data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, said 35 children were among those killed. He said hospitals in the enclave “are still facing a severe shortage of resources and a significant lack of medicines.”\n\nGaza’s Civil Defense emergency rescue service also said that at least 100 people had been killed.\n\nPresident Trump said on Wednesday that he supported Israel’s strikes in Gaza, saying Israel “should hit back” when its soldiers were killed. But he said that “nothing is going to jeopardize” the cease-fire, which is based on a peace plan he proposed last month.\n\n“Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One during a trip to South Korea. He added, “If they’re not good, they’re going to be terminated.”\n\nAt Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in Gaza on Wednesday, a New York Times reporter saw women weeping over the bodies of children. Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, an official there, said the hospital had received the bodies of 21 people killed in the strikes, including 13 children.\n\nThe strikes came after a week of escalating tensions over delays to the exchange of deceased captives between Israel and Hamas, a key plank of the fragile cease-fire deal that went into effect this month.\n\nTensions boiled over on Tuesday when gunmen in Gaza attacked a group of soldiers in Rafah, southern Gaza. The military said that militants had opened fire on Israeli troops who were dismantling a Hamas tunnel in an area under Israeli military control in eastern Gaza.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Israeli military released a drone video that it said showed that Hamas was trying “to create a false impression” about its efforts to locate deceased captives.\n\nHamas denied involvement in the Rafah attack. It has insisted it is acting in good faith to locate and return the remains of people it took from Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.\n\nThe drone footage showed what the Israeli military said were Hamas members faking the discovery of a deceased captive as observers from the Red Cross watched. The aid group said its staff was unaware that a body had been moved before their arrival. “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged,” the Red Cross said in a statement.\n\nWhen asked about the video on Tuesday, Hamas referred The Times to an earlier statement that accused Israel of creating false pretexts for military action.\n\nAfter the Israeli government announced its decision to strike Gaza, David Mencer, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, cited both the shooting and the events depicted in the video as violations of the cease-fire.\n\nGabby Sobelman, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad Abu Bakr Bashir and Iyad Abuheweila contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/nyregion/mikie-sherrill-new-jersey-governor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"03:00:12-04:00","title":"A Fan of ‘Ruthless Competence,’ She Wants to Be Governor of New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In July 2024, after President Joe Biden’s poor debate performance, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey became one of only seven individuals to publicly urge him to step down from his re-election campaign.

In the cross hairs of President Trump’s assault on America’s cities and facing an acute affordability crisis, voters will choose on Nov. 4 from a unique slate of candidates: Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, who surprised experts by winning the Democratic primary in June; Andrew Cuomo, the three-term governor forced to resign amid a wave of sexual misconduct accusations, now running as an independent; and Curtis Sliwa, a Republican making his second run for mayor.\n\nTimes Opinion brought together 14 panelists to assess the candidates and their ability to lead the city; 11 returned from the panel we convened for the Democratic primary in June. In particular, the panelists explored how Mr. Cuomo stacked up against Mr. Mamdani, who has maintained a steady lead in the polls after energizing a broad coalition of voters with a message laser-focused on the cost of living.\n\nSome of the panelists who favored Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, in the June primary, embraced Mr. Mamdani’s vision for fresh approaches to seemingly intractable problems, while placing a bet that he would overcome his relative inexperience in government. “We’re riding on hope here,” said one. Many agreed with another panelist’s assessment that it was “time for a generational shift.” A few panelists spoke favorably about Mr. Cuomo’s long experience in government, but most felt he represented a tired and pugilistic style of politics and hadn’t done enough to change that dynamic.\n\nThe Choice was compiled by editors in Times Opinion using a brief questionnaire, material from a round-table discussion in early October and individual discussions. The material has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter one participant dropped out late in the process, Joseph Borelli was added to the panel, but not in time for the round-table discussion; He conveyed his views in an interview and in the questionnaire.\n\nIt looks like Mamdani is going to win, but you never know absolutely what’s going to happen in an election. We’re riding on hope here because we don’t really know who this guy is, ultimately, but he’s doing a lot of the right things, like talking and listening to people in the business community as part of understanding how complicated this city is.\n\nI hear that we don’t know definitively how he will be as mayor, whereas with Cuomo, we have his background. But I think with Cuomo, his background is not good, right? We’ve seen that he rewards his donors. We’ve seen that he retaliates against folks who oppose him.\n\nOn his core issues, Mamdani has stayed remarkably consistent. He’s had a laser focus on affordability and quality of life as it is experienced. And that is the No. 1 issue facing New Yorkers. Like Eleanor, I’ve been pleased and encouraged by what I have experienced as genuine and sincere outreach to corners of New York City society and economy that perhaps were very skeptical of him. And he has demonstrated a remarkable degree of openness that many politicians do not seem to have, a willingness to learn.\n\nThis is effectively a two-way choice. On the one hand, you have somebody who has a wealth of experience, has been an attorney general, a governor, a cabinet secretary. And on the other hand, you have somebody who hardly has work experience. So that’s what it comes down to for me.\n\nAndrew Cuomo will not be as conservative as I’d like him to be. I think he won’t be as progressive as others would like him to be. I think he’ll be more moderate by definition. And that, to me, is a better outcome than having someone who will almost always be looking to accelerate the progressive socialist agenda. Mamdani is running not just to fix the potholes. He’s running to implement a vision of government that is not shared by myself and not shared by a lot of New Yorkers.\n\nI think Mamdani’s a compelling candidate with vast upside but much more downside than people recognize. He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. He is prepared to give up control of the school system, and that is a path to more education failure, not greater success.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack in what Mitchell said. Since the ’70s we’ve had the Financial Emergency Act, which calls for a balanced budget. And so the budget should also be thought of as a set of choices that the mayor and the City Council make about the allocation of resources. Mamdani has been clear about the priorities he would set in a way that this current administration has not done. And look, we’re going to be in a pitched battle next year with a federal administration that’s withholding funds.\n\nI want to explore a little bit of an intangible. Mamdani has tapped into the way that a whole swath of this city that’s a lot younger than me understands and experiences life. And he’s able to not only grasp that, but give voice to a lot of what they’re feeling and offer solutions and directions that they can connect to. And I think there’s a genius in that we shouldn’t miss or dismiss. And I think that same genius can be brought to bear on governing the city. It’s probably time for a generational shift in leadership in this city.\n\nBrad [Lander] was my choice in the primary, and then Brad now is not on the ticket. What option do I have?\n\nSo Mamdani’s under no illusion that Trump’s going to make it easy for him. But he also knows it’s not a battle he has to fight alone, that he has the governor, state legislative leaders and members of Congress.\n\nI don’t trust Cuomo to protect New York City. I think that he will acquiesce to Donald Trump in ways that he says he won’t, but he’s a lot of bluster.\n\nI think this issue has been framed to be one-sided. Why do we assume that Trump is going to come after New York when, in reality, Mamdani is going to benefit politically from going after the Trump administration, and being the leading far-left figure in American politics?\n\nI think that Andrew Cuomo actually had a really good opportunity to push back on the Trump administration when they threatened to arrest someone — Mamdani — who won a Democratic contest for mayor. He didn’t. And I think that’s really indicative of who Andrew Cuomo is. To the extent he was an effective leader, it’s because he was a bully. He cannot deal with Trump, someone with more power than him.\n\nOn Trump, Cuomo has already sold out. He’s not really spoken out against the harmful things the Trump administration has already done. He’s courting many of the same kinds of voters.\n\nI’ve been profoundly disappointed by the lack of conversation about education during the campaign from all the candidates. The Times recently published a story, 140,000 homeless students in New York. And I don’t hear the candidates really talking an awful lot about how to address what is, in my view, a really systemic crisis. I think the mayor should be running the school system. There should be a point of accountability. If parents feel like they have been shut out and Mamdani feels that way, too, he can bring them in.\n\nI think around a million students having a school system overseen by someone who has managed an office of five or so people and only has a few years of experience in the State Assembly —\n\nOn school control, the law is what the law is. He will still have to appoint a chancellor and members to the panel of education policy. The mayor still has to do that. But we do need to engage parents who are active.\n\nOn housing, it’s a central issue to New Yorkers of all ages, especially renters. I think there’s a real need for not only a focus on building, which I think is crucial, but also deep affordability.\n\nHousing is not my first issue. But if it were, I think I’d be really excited about Zohran. It has been a big part of his affordability messaging. And just looking at how he’s prioritizing it, I can tell that he cares a lot about it.\n\nCuomo had the edge on this last time we met because he did not call for defunding the police. And he didn’t call them racists, which Mamdani did and has now walked back from. This was like five years ago, during the beginning of his political career.\n\nAnd after George Floyd died, we saw 10 minutes of people actually caring about racialized policing. Now we’re seeing real retrenchment from that. I think that is why Cuomo was given so much unearned grace. Something that we haven’t really talked about here yet is that Mamdani is the first Muslim candidate who has a very real chance of becoming mayor. For most of his life, he is much more likely to have been profiled because of who he is than to be mayor, to be any elected official at all whatsoever.\n\nMamdani has talked about how policing alone cannot solve social issues happening on the street — trauma, mental health, housing. If the police are the first in, people in crisis end up in Rikers, not in care. That’s not the answer.\n\nI think Sliwa would be the best to deal with policing, but he’s not going to win. I think he has a more rational view: that there are bad people who need to be prosecuted, punished and put in jail.\n\nPublic safety and policing are totally different subjects. School safety, mental health, homeless issues: They’re all public safety.\n\nThere’s another issue besides public safety. And that is how the police and the mayor are going to deal with the possibility of the president and his team sending up people to walk around the streets with their guns out and all that sort of stuff.\n\nI think it’s important to look at the data. The data shows that more police officers in the subway, on the streets and on corners in high-crime neighborhoods can reduce crime.\n\nEric Adams was probably the most pro-police mayor that we’ve had in a while. And we’re still hemorrhaging police officers.\n\nMamdani has energized an enormous number of people who were previously outside of the political process and did not see themselves as central to it. And to miss that would be an enormous mistake and, as a Democrat, completely foolish.\n\nIt’s not as if the establishment could have produced a Mamdani. The Democratic Party has not been engaging with folks who could be the next great electeds. And it’s not going to be just a person who presents in the same way as Mamdani. We’ve seen campaigns across the country who are looking to emulate his campaign by doing walking-style TikTok videos. But that’s not what was great about Mamdani’s campaign. It was great because it was connecting with everyday New Yorkers around issues that matter to them, that presented creative solutions.\n\nI have some strong critiques of the Democratic Socialists of America still, but they have been using their network as a way to bring people into the political fold in a way that the parties haven’t. I think a lot of voters feel really disrespected by the establishment. Because the voters spoke on June 24 and said: We don’t want you, Andrew Cuomo. Go home.\n\nI have to think that a lot of the refusal to support Mamdani is Islamophobia. And I think that there’s going to be a real reckoning with that at some point.\n\nI lost my election last year because Democrats don’t know how to address cost of living. When the primary result came out, it was like: What am I going to do as a voter, as an immigrant? I looked at Mamdani’s policies again. Sure, I do want those city-run grocery stores down my block. Do I want free buses? Yes, I do. New York State actually can afford statewide universal free lunch, school lunch. It’s just about priorities. We don’t have a shot if we don’t try. We need to try.\n\nDemocrats have to embrace winning and be a bit more fearless about that. As important or more important than this election is that, once elected, Mamdani succeeds, and the Democrats abandon their approach of disqualifying and discouraging winning candidates and instead start investing in their success.\n\nMamdani is running like he wants to serve. It’s not like he’s running for a job or for power. And we too often have candidates who are about power and control, not community.\n\nSome of his promises are achievable independently at the city level; others require real partnership with Albany. Overall, these fresh ideas are proxies for goals that he wants to achieve because they are the core issues that people face every day.\n\nI think the city was ripe for new ideas. The problem is, some of those ideas aren’t really practical or financially feasible. We can talk about free buses, but what happens when you take, you know, $800 million out of the fare box of the M.T.A.? How do we make up for that shortfall?\n\nThe universal child care that he’s proposing. He wants families of newborns to get baby baskets, something they do around the world. You don’t realize how expensive these things are until you have to go shopping for a baby.\n\nWe basically have hope versus despair. Cuomo is despair. Each one has different strengths. But my students are working for Mamdani. And I mean of every race and income.\n\nI think that we have to appreciate that he’s not changing. This is a belief. And when you buy the mayor, you buy the belief.\n\nWe should recognize the lunacy of voting for Sliwa. I’m not saying he’s not going to get votes, but it’s a wasted vote.\n\nThat’s saying a lot. To be clear, Sliwa is not the lovable eccentric some make him out to be — he’s not a serious candidate. His platform is riddled with proposals that a mayor can’t actually enact, like rolling back the 2019 state tenant protections that only Albany can touch. Other parts of his agenda veer into the downright Orwellian. He’s not even a Bloomberg Republican. On policy, he’s Trump in a red beret.\n\nI think Sliwa will do better than expected. There’s going to be some people who are like: This 33-year-old kid and some of these ideas are just maybe a bridge too far for me. [Mr. Mamdani turned 34 after this discussion took place.] And Cuomo is an absolute no. And there are some people who will never be able to vote for a nonwhite person.\n\nI admire the way in which Mamdani has framed his belief that we can make the city better. His work in political campaigns has been terrific. The evidence that he’s a great manager is the great campaign he ran. But running for office and governing are opposite skills. One is performance art. The other is a day-to-day job of distributing not just joy and benefits, but pain, too.\n\nMamdani’s appointments, if he wins, will matter a lot. Who’s going to be the first deputy mayor? Is there going to be a deputy mayor charged with figuring out how to integrate the Department of Community Safety with the N.Y.P.D.? Every indication is that he’s going about not just his campaign but his transition with the intent of providing convincing answers to all of that.\n\nThere’s just a big difference between running a campaign and running one of the largest cities in the world. Experience matters for the second most important job in America.\n\nI’m just hearing all these comments about Mamdani’s relative lack of experience, but the ones who had experience didn’t deliver for the people who mobilized behind Mamdani. These are people and communities who have been left behind for decades.\n\nWell, we’ve got someone who has the most important job in America who has zero experience. Take a chance.\n\nAdditional reporting by Julie Ho. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

Tracking Hurricane Melissa\n\nPublished: 2025-10-28T15:15:00-04:00\n\nBy William B. Davis, Madison Dong, Judson Jones, John Keefe, Joey K. Lee, Bea Malsky and Pablo Robles\n\nMelissa was a Category 5 hurricane over Jamaica Tuesday afternoon Jamaica time, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2025. Follow our coverage here.\n\nJamaica is a small country that depends on tourism for about a third of its annual revenue. It has limited resources to prepare for devastating storms, according to disaster and emergency preparedness experts. Officials had anticipated that some 50,000 of Jamaica’s 2.8 million population would be displaced by the storm.\n\nFlash flooding can occur well inland and away from the storm’s center. Even weaker storms can produce excessive rainfall that can flood low-lying areas.\n\nWeather satellites can help highlight details not visible to the human eye. The map shows a specific spectral band that helps identify clouds and water vapor throughout the day and night.\n\nSatellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season started on June 1 and runs through Nov. 30.\n\nIn late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent agency of the National Weather Service, predicted that this would be an above-average season, with 13 to 19 named storms. In early August, a revised forecast from NOAA predicted 18 named storms for the season and said up to nine of them could become hurricanes.\n\nLast year, there were 18 named storms, 11 of which became hurricanes. Five of those hurricanes became what the Hurricane Center calls “major,” or Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale.\n\nHurricane Beryl was one of two Category 5 hurricanes last year, and it set records for the earliest point in a season that a storm had grown so big. In contrast, this year was one of the slowest starts to a season in 20 years.\n\nLike the other most powerful storms last year, Beryl’s quick intensity was a result of above-average ocean temperatures. But this year, in the main region where storms typically form, the ocean heat content —the measure of thermal energy stored in the ocean that can fuel storms— has been slightly below average in June.\n\nExperts think it is probable that a major hurricane will make landfall in the U.S. this season. Climate experts have warned intense storms like these are more likely to occur, with more rapid intensification likely in a warming world.\n\nLast year was also one of the most costly for hurricanes in the United States. Hurricanes Helene and Milton combined caused about $113 billion in damages and more than 250 deaths. This May, the Trump administration said it would no longer maintain a database of so-called billion-dollar disasters.\n\nThe Trump administration has slashed the number of employees at many of the agencies traditionally responsible for planning for and responding to natural disasters, including NOAA, the Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nClimate change is also affecting the amount of rain that storms can produce. In a warming world, the air can hold more moisture, which means a named storm can hold and produce more rainfall, like Hurricane Harvey did in Texas in 2017, when some areas received more than 40 inches of rain in less than 48 hours.\n\nResearchers have also found that storms have slowed down, staying over areas for more extended periods, over the past few decades.\n\nTracking map Tracking data is from the National Hurricane Center. The map shows probabilities of at least 5 percent. The forecast is for up to five days, with that time span starting up to three hours before the reported time that the storm reaches its latest location. Wind speed probability data is not available north of 60.25 degrees north latitude.\n\nIntensity chart Best track and forecast path are from the National Hurricane Center. Forecast models are from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\n\nWind arrivals table Arrival times are generated from a New York Times analysis of National Hurricane Center data. Geographic locations use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Natural Earth. Time zones are based on Google. The table shows predicted arrival times of sustained, damaging winds of 58 m.p.h. or more for select cities with a chance of such winds reaching them. If damaging winds reach a location, there is no more than a 10 percent chance that they will arrive before the “earliest reasonable” time and a 50 percent chance they will arrive before the “most likely” time.\n\nRadar map Radar imagery is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nStorm surge map Storm surge data is from the National Hurricane Center. Forecasts only include the United States Gulf and Atlantic coasts, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The actual areas that could become flooded may differ from the areas shown on this map. This map accounts for tides, but not waves and not flooding caused by rainfall. The map also includes intertidal areas, which routinely flood during typical high tides.\n\nRip currents map Rip current data is from the National Hurricane Center. Rip current risk shown is not always associated with active tropical cyclones.\n\nSatellite map Imagery is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Japanese Meteorological Agency via the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere.\n\nPrecipitation map Data for multi-day forecasts or observed rainfall totals are from the National Weather Service. The 1-day forecast is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nNote: All basemaps are built with Daylight (urban areas); Natural Earth (roads, labels, terrain)\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/movies/practical-magic-halloween-kidman-bullock.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:01:45-04:00","title":"‘Practical Magic,’ Eternally Enchanting and Confounding","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the enduring cultural impact of the 1998 film 'Practical Magic,' despite its critical and commercial failure.

2025-10-29T05:01:45-04:00\n\nWhat’s a “good-bad” movie? It’s the kind of flick that might have you cackling, hollering or groaning, one that is not necessarily great cinema but is great fun. It’s highly watchable even though — or maybe because — it’s memorably ridiculous. And it always has at least one element that pushes it into absurd territory.\n\nMany fans of “Practical Magic,” Griffin Dunne’s witchy and kitschy 1998 romantic fantasy, were over the moon when Nicole Kidman confirmed that she and Sandra Bullock would reprise their roles for the film’s 2026 sequel.\n\nThe original movie, based on an Alice Hoffman novel, stars the two actresses as the Owens sisters: Gillian (Kidman), the free-spirited family flirt and seductress, and Sally (Bullock), the pragmatic homebody who we’re supposed to believe is kind of frumpy because she sometimes wears glasses.\n\nThe sisters come from a long line of witches, including their incantation-slinging aunts, played by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing. They all suffer under a curse cast hundreds of years ago by a heartbroken ancestor: that men who fall in love with Owens women will be struck dead.\n\n“Practical Magic” was a box-office flop and was panned by critics; ours called it a “bouncy, bubble-brained movie,” something akin to “Barbie Joins a Coven,” and “nothing but a guilty pleasure.” But the film, which conjures up abundant autumnal splendor and sisterly spells with just a dash of spook, has since gained a cult following.\n\nHere’s my breakdown of why, ultimately, despite its many flaws, “Practical Magic” prevails as a Halloween classic.\n\nWhat Makes It Good?\n\nThe story is set in famously witchy Massachusetts. The house and garden at the center of the movie — the homestead for the Owens’ women — is perhaps the movie’s most beloved character. The aesthetic, inside and out, is the height of cozy cottagecore dreaminess. Its expansive and creaky wood floors, antique windows, greenhouse full of herbs and vintage-maximalism kitchen would make anyone want to try their hand at mixing potions.\n\nKidman and Bullock convincingly sell their sisterly bond as unbreakable despite their wildly different personalities. They both have an infectious charm and the all-important quality of impossibly shiny, flowing locks.\n\n“Practical Magic” also has a stellar soundtrack, with songs from Stevie Nicks, Faith Hill, Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell and Elvis Presley, whose rendition of the ballad “Always on My Mind” is permanently spookified here.\n\nWhat Makes It Bad?\n\nThis movie has become a cult favorite among women for its warmhearted celebration of sisterhood and for showing women collectively harnessing their powers to overcome obstacles — a comfort watch often touted for its themes of female empowerment.\n\nBut the reality of its plot doesn’t live up to that reputation. While there are very few men in the movie, most of the female relationships revolve entirely around men: pining for them, loving them, losing them, casting spells on them, escaping them, killing them, bringing them back to life only to kill them again.\n\nLittle girls and grown women are equally depicted as boy-crazy chocoholics and are, as our critic put it, “hopelessly retrograde.” Corny sentiments about “true love” are relentlessly dispensed.\n\nThese dynamics also chafe against the plot’s very serious driving theme: domestic violence. Sally helps Gillian escape her psychopathic and abusive boyfriend, the “Dracula cowboy” Jimmy Angelov (Goran Visnjic).\n\nFurther, during one of the most spirited and memorable scenes — drunken midnight margaritas at home — the four main witches cap off the fun with a rousing round of “Real Housewives”-style insult-hurling, using words like “slut” and “shrew.” Though the movie does well for never shaming Gillian’s party-girl ways or suggesting she is to blame for her miserable situation.\n\nWhat Makes It GOOD-Bad?\n\nWhen it was released, “Practical Magic” took a lot of heat from critics for its abundant plot holes and constant, confusing tonal shifts: Is it a comedy, a drama, a horror? Is it cutesy or creepy? If it had come out today, audiences would certainly speculate that the script was written by A.I.\n\nOne minute, for example, the sisters are wringing their hands over murdering Jimmy, suggesting they should go to the police and claim self-defense (which it was) so they don’t end up in prison. Then a couple of scenes later, they are surprisingly unbothered as they bury his body in the backyard of the family home before dancing around like nothing’s amiss.\n\nBut there is plenty amiss, and embracing the film’s nonsensical, unpredictable, often ludicrous and thoroughly impractical nature — which demands you scrutinize nothing — is what makes “Practical Magic” such an amusing romp, and is maybe the movie’s most successful spell.\n\nVideos: Warner Bros.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/28/us/wildfire-smoke-firefighter-deaths.html","dateOfPublication":"0716-12-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"12 Hours in the Smoke","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article investigates the growing health crisis among wildfire firefighters in the U.S., focusing on the Green fire in Northern California.

An elite federal firefighting crew called the La Grande Hotshots has been sent to help. The 24-person crew has been working for days on the front lines, where invisible toxins hide in the thick haze.\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters are on the fire. Several crews, including the La Grande Hotshots, are trying to contain the flames by building a trench of bare earth that will stretch from a road to a river bank. They’re doing this at night, in hopes that the cooler air will tamp down the smoke.\n\nThe crew knows that they’re risking their health.\n\nOne longtime member died last year after being diagnosed at 40 with brain cancer. A former crew leader is being treated for both leukemia and lymphoma diagnosed in his 40s. Another colleague was recently told that he has the lungs of a lifelong chainsmoker.\n\nWildfire fighters nationwide are getting sick and dying at young ages, The New York Times has reported. The federal government acknowledges that the job is linked to lung disease, heart damage and more than a dozen kinds of cancer.\n\nCasey Budlong, a La Grande Hotshot, died of cancer in 2024 after fighting fires for two decades. He left behind an 8-year-old son.\n\nBut the U.S. Forest Service, which employs thousands of firefighters, has for decades ignored recommendations from its own scientists to monitor the conditions at the fire line and limit shifts when the air becomes unsafe.\n\nTo find out how harmful the air gets on an average-size wildfire, Times reporters brought sensors to the Green fire this summer. We tracked levels of some of the most lethal particles in the air, called PM2.5, which are so tiny that they can enter the bloodstream and cause lasting damage.\n\nReadings above 225.5 micrograms per cubic meter are considered hazardous. On the fire line, levels regularly exceeded 500.\n\nThe fire began on July 1 after a lightning storm passed over the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.\n\nThe fire began on July 1 after a lightning storm passed over the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.\n\nBy July 16, much of the area was shrouded in smoke.\n\nBy July 16, much of the area was shrouded in smoke.\n\nThat afternoon, a bulldozer carved a containment line that firefighters would expand by carefully burning a wide swath around it, depriving the flames of more fuel.\n\nThat afternoon, a bulldozer carved a containment line that firefighters would expand by carefully burning a wide swath around it, depriving the flames of more fuel.\n\nForest Service crews had to hike up a ridge to get to the line.

Visibility was good, and the air didn’t smell smoky. But our monitors showed readings well into hazardous levels.\n\nAround 6 p.m., the La Grande Hotshots started their shift and set off toward the fire line.\n\nCapt. Nick Schramm, a crew leader, assumed the air was reasonably safe. He has done this work for nearly two decades, and like most firefighters, he often has coughing fits after long shifts. But he believes that exposure to hazardous air is unavoidable.\n\n“That’s just the harsh truth,” he said later.\n\nAs climate change makes fire seasons worse, several states have tried to shield outdoor workers from wildfire smoke, which can contain poisons like arsenic, benzene and lead. California now requires employers to monitor air quality during fires, and to provide breaks and masks when the air turns unhealthy.\n\nBut these rules don’t apply on the wildfires themselves, because state agencies and private companies successfully argued that those constraints would get in the way of fighting fires.\n\nUntil recently, federal firefighters weren’t even allowed to wear masks on the job. Masks are now provided, but they are still banned during the most arduous work, closest to the fire. The Forest Service says face coverings could cause heatstroke, though wildland firefighters in other countries regularly use masks without this problem.\n\nAs crews descended the ridge toward the fire line, the levels of toxic particles nearly doubled.\n\nAs crews descended the ridge toward the fire line, the levels of toxic particles nearly doubled.\n\nFirefighters say that during their shifts they worry more about immediate dangers — falling trees, burns, sharp tools — than about smoke exposure. As the La Grande crew hiked down the steep terrain, Lily Barnes, a squad leader, concentrated on keeping her footing.\n\nBack home in the off-season, she sometimes wonders what the smoke is doing to her body, she said in an interview. “Maybe I’ll realize one day I shouldn’t have been doing this work.”\n\nOn the fire line, the La Grande crew waited for conditions to be right to burn away vegetation.

But our readings showed that it was just as hazardous.\n\nMany firefighters believe that if they can sidestep visible plumes of smoke, they will be in somewhat safer air. But our readings showed that it was just as hazardous.\n\nThe handbook issued to Forest Service crews has 10 words of guidance for smoke exposure on the fire line: “If needed, rotate resources in and out of smoky areas.” The agency declined to comment for this story, but in the past has told The Times that while exposure cannot be completely eliminated, rotating crews helps limit risk.\n\nIn practice, according to interviews with hundreds of firefighters, workers feel as though they are sent into smoke and then forgotten. Over months of reporting, Times journalists never saw a boss pull a crew back because of exposure.\n\nEven experienced supervisors can’t tell exactly how unhealthy the air is just by looking.\n\nChuy Elguezabal, the La Grande superintendent, says he pulls his crews out of smoke when it becomes impossible for them to work — when they cannot see or breathe, or they are overcome by headaches and coughing fits.\n\nOn the Green fire, he said, the smoke seemed like more of an inconvenience, like the 105-degree daytime heat or the poison oak that had given many of the firefighters weeping sores.\n\nSince the 1990s, Forest Service researchers have suggested giving crews wearable air sensors, but the agency hasn’t done it. Other dangerous workplaces, like coal mines, have long been required to monitor airborne hazards.\n\nA 1999 Forest Service report that recommended wearable air monitors.\n\nOn the Green fire, The Times used a device that weighs as much as a deck of cards and costs about $200.\n\nLast year, firefighters wore the same devices during a small federal research project to measure their exposure. For hours, those readings stayed at 1,000 — as high as the monitors go — according to Zach Kiehl, a consultant who worked on the project.\n\nMr. Kiehl said that ideally, crews would be issued monitors to know when to put on masks or pull back from a smoky area. “You can pay now and prevent future cases, or pay out later when a person is losing a husband or a father,” he said.\n\nThe La Grande crew has been working in heavy smoke for hours now. They spray water to make sure the fire doesn’t reach the treetops, where it can’t be contained.\n\nThe La Grande crew has been working in heavy smoke for hours now.

They think the exposure was fleeting.\n\nIn fact, the monitors show, the air was never safe.\n\nTo measure particulate concentrations at the Green fire, The Times followed U.S. Forest Service crews and carried two Atmotube PRO sensors. These portable, inexpensive monitors are the same as those the Forest Service has tested in the field.\n\nWe consulted with Dr. Aishah Shittu, an environmental health scientist, and Dr. Jim McQuaid, an atmospheric scientist, both from the University of Leeds. They are co-authors of a study showing that Atmotube Pro sensors demonstrated good performance for measuring fine particulate matter concentrations despite being a fraction of the size of reference-grade models. We also developed our approach in consultation with experts from the Interior Department and the Forest Service.\n\nOn the Green fire, the sensors recorded minute-by-minute averages of airborne particles that are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. The Times then matched these readings with timestamps and locations from a satellite-enabled GPS watch.\n\nGenerally, the harm associated with PM2.5 levels is calculated based on a 24-hour average. Here, for near-real-time monitoring on the fire line, we followed the guidance of Drs. Shittu and McQuaid by first averaging the readings from the two sensors and then calculating a 15-minute rolling average.\n\nUsing those figures, we categorized the health risks of PM2.5 exposure according to standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We used standards meant for the public because there are no federal occupational standards for wildfire smoke exposure.\n\nAfter averaging, our data had a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and a mean coefficient of variation between the two sensors of 7.5 percent. The E.P.A. recommends that PM2.5 air measurements have a correlation coefficient of at least 0.7 and a mean coefficient of variation less than 30 percent. Our correlation and variance measures gave us confidence that the sensors were largely in agreement.\n\nThe 3-D base map in this article uses Google’s Photorealistic 3D Tiles, which draw from the following sources to create the tiles: Google; Airbus; Landsat / Copernicus; Data SIO, NOAA, U.S. Navy, NGA, GEBCO; IBCAO.\n\nADDITIONAL REPORTING By MAX WHITTAKER and LAUREN McCARTHY.

Charts\n\nPublished: Date not found\n\nPresident Trump vowed to bring factories back. Is he succeeding?\n\nBy Farah Stockman\n\nGraphics by Karl Russell\n\nFarah Stockman covers manufacturing. Karl Russell visualizes economic and market data.\n\nPresident Trump’s second term has been marked by a flurry of company pledges to expand production in the United States. From Apple’s plan to source glass covers for iPhones from a Kentucky plant to Stellantis’s investments across four states, the announcements suggest a resurgence of industrial activity.\n\nTariffs have pushed some companies to boost manufacturing in the United States, but have also driven up the cost of raw materials and specialized machines. Federal incentives for clean energy have been rolled back, prompting some electric vehicle battery plants to be canceled. And the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has made it more difficult for some facilities to hire workers.\n\nThese challenges, along with other longstanding issues, such as underinvestment in technology and training programs, weigh on the sector and offer a mixed picture of success.\n\nFactory construction: the share of the manufacturing industry’s contribution to the U.S. economy that is spent on building factories.\n\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, via UBS\n\nFactory construction in the United States has increased, spurred by supply-chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic and large federal subsidies for semiconductors and clean energy passed during the Biden administration. But there are signs that the boom could be fading.\n\nSpending on factory construction by all sorts of companies — one of the clearest barometers of the “Made in America” revival — went from around 3.5 percent of the manufacturing economy in 2021 to 8 percent in 2024, a level not seen in more than 40 years, said Paul Donovan, the global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management. Spending has declined from its peak in the third quarter of 2024, he said, although it remains high.\n\nThe dip may have been partly driven by uncertainty surrounding tariffs and fears that the rising cost of imported materials would render construction projects unprofitable.\n\nSome companies canceled construction projects immediately after Mr. Trump announced tariffs on dozens of countries in April, said Michael Guckes, chief economist of ConstructConnect, a company that provides software and market insight to construction industry professionals. But building has picked up again.\n\nNearly $86 billion was spent on manufacturing facilities from January to September, driven in part by investments in high-value semiconductor factories and pharmaceutical facilities, Mr. Guckes added. “It has been a very strong year for manufacturing,” he said.\n\nAbout 12.7 million people work in manufacturing in the United States — a modest rebound from the pandemic’s lows. But the sector has been shedding jobs, a slow bleed that obscures deeper shifts. Some of the steepest losses came in semiconductors, auto parts and aerospace — industries once heralded as pillars of a manufacturing revival.\n\nOne-year change in manufacturing jobs by industry, July 2025 vs July 2024, top and bottom 10 industries.\n\nArchitectural,\n\nstructural metals\n\nFruit, vegetable preserving,\n\nspecialty food\n\nCement, concrete product\n\nVentilation, heating, air-\n\nconditioning, refrigeration\n\nAnimal slaughtering,\n\nDairy product\n\nPharmaceutical, medicine\n\nCommercial, service\n\nindustry machinery\n\nOffice furniture (including\n\nfixtures), related\n\nConverted paper product\n\nShip, boat building\n\nSugar, confectionery\n\nSeafood product\n\npreparation and packaging\n\nOther general\n\npurpose machinery\n\nRubber product\n\nMachine shops; turned\n\nproduct; screw, nut, bolt\n\nAerospace product, parts\n\nAgriculture, construction,\n\nmining machinery\n\nMotor vehicle parts\n\nSemiconductor, other\n\nelectronic component\n\nArchitectural and structural metals\n\nFruit and vegetable preserving\n\nand specialty food\n\nCement and concrete product\n\nVentilation, heating, air-\n\nconditioning and refrigeration\n\nAnimal slaughtering and processing\n\nDairy product\n\nPharmaceutical and medicine\n\nCommercial and service\n\nindustry machinery\n\nOffice furniture (including\n\nfixtures) and related\n\nConverted paper product\n\nShip and boat building\n\nSugar and confectionery product\n\nSeafood product\n\npreparation and packaging\n\nOther general purpose machinery\n\nRubber product\n\nMachine shops; turned product;\n\nand screw, nut and bolt\n\nAerospace product and parts\n\nAgriculture, construction\n\nand mining machinery\n\nMotor vehicle parts\n\nSemiconductor and other\n\nelectronic component\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nMany companies are in a holding pattern, wary of making big hiring or firing decisions until the dust settles on tariffs, said Thomas Derry, chief executive of the Institute for Supply Management, which surveys factory executives each month.\n\n“What we hear from our respondents, it is mostly about not backfilling positions,” he said.\n\nMass layoffs in the sector have mostly been avoided, but an exception is Intel, which has received billions in federal funding. The domestic chipmaker is shrinking its work force by about 25,000 employees this year.\n\nSome facilities have found it more difficult to hire or retain workers after the Trump administration revoked temporary protected status for about 500,000 Haitians, Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans. In July, more than 200 immigrants were let go from a JBS pork production facility in Iowa because they were no longer eligible to work legally in the United States.\n\nDespite bursts of investment in recent years, the United States trails much of the developed world in harnessing automation to boost productivity. The country ranks just 10th globally in its reliance on robots, lagging behind Slovenia, Switzerland and a host of Asian economies that have made automation a priority, according to the International Federation of Robotics.\n\nAmerican factories employ nearly 300 robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers, compared with 470 in China and about 1,010 in South Korea, which leads the world.\n\nRobot density in the manufacturing sector. The number of robots installed per 10,000 workers, 2023.\n\nLarge squares represent\n\n10,000 workers\n\nSwitzerland\n\nNetherlands\n\nBelgium and\n\nLarge squares represent\n\n10,000 workers\n\nSwitzerland\n\nNetherlands\n\nBelgium and\n\nSource: International Federation of Robotics\n\nNote: figures are rounded to the nearest 10.\n\nMost American factories are small businesses that have traditionally struggled to embrace and afford new technology. The price of an industrial robot has fallen over the past decade, but the upfront investment remains steep for many firms. And even those willing to spend on robots often struggle to find workers who can program, operate and maintain the machines.\n\nIt is unclear whether a new wave of tax credits and work force training initiatives can finally close that gap — or whether the world’s manufacturing powerhouses will continue to pull ahead.\n\nJim Farley, the chief executive of Ford Motor, has raised alarms for months about what he considers one of the biggest problems in the economy: The productivity of sectors that make, fix and transport things in America has flatlined or declined over the last decade, while the productivity of “white collar” sectors like business services has grown at a far healthier rate.\n\nBut measuring productivity — which economists define as the value of goods and services produced per hour of work — is notoriously tricky, experts say. While government data shows that productivity growth in manufacturing has been sluggish ever since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, economists argue that official statistics fail to capture increases in the quality of products.\n\nA new working paper by Enghin Atalay, Ali Hortacsu, Nicole Kimmel and Chad Syverson provides evidence that productivity growth in American manufacturing was stronger than previously thought.\n\nAs “smart factories” squeeze efficiencies from machines and workers, using sensors to catch defects, predict breakdowns and cut waste, there’s hope for a breakthrough.  Still, manufacturing accounts for a shrinking share of the American economy, which is still dominated by services. China, by contrast, remains deeply reliant on manufacturing, which has powered its rise. That dependence, along with its vast industrial capacity, suggests that Beijing will remain a formidable competitor for years to come.\n\nManufacturing: the share of the manufacturing industry's contribution to each economy.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEuropean Union\n\nSource: The World Bank\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-podcast-radio.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"03:00:12-04:00","title":"How Andrew Cuomo’s Dreams of Becoming a Radio Star Fell Apart","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrew M.

Andrew M. Cuomo struck to start his own podcast in 2022 looked almost perfect.\n\nThe show, “As a Matter of Fact … With Andrew Cuomo,” offered an uncensored platform to mend his reputation a year after he resigned in a sexual harassment scandal. He laughed with Sean Penn and Kellyanne Conway and dished “straight talk” about his party’s faults. There was talk of interviewing Donald J. Trump.\n\nAnd the endeavor came with the promise of a big payday. Quake Media, a buzzy start-up known for its right-wing hosts, paid Mr. Cuomo as much as $40,000 a month, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.\n\nBut this was no star turn. Instead of launching Mr. Cuomo’s comeback, his foray into online media turned out to be the beginning of a protracted — and often humbling — misadventure that only ended this spring when he decided to run for mayor of New York City.\n\nMr. Cuomo, 67, has managed to keep most details about his podcasting career under wraps. But a review of previously unreported court records and interviews with a dozen people involved show the lengths he was willing to go to restore his name.\n\nIt began with Quake Media. But when the start-up began unraveling, Mr. Cuomo tried others in the Republican spectrum. He courted a conservative talk radio powerhouse and had a portentous run-in with a Republican rival in a familiar red beret. And, in a bizarre twist, the podcasts he made may soon be owned by a well-known Fox News host.\n\nPowerful allies privy to the work said they could only guess why Mr. Cuomo was so determined.\n\n“You are asking me to be his psychiatrist!” said John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of WABC, a conservative talk radio station where Mr. Cuomo tried to get on the air.\n\n“But I think he wanted to stay relevant politically,” he said. “Once you are out of the media for a period of time, you become irrelevant.”\n\nMr. Cuomo now finds himself in a similar position. He is trying to salvage his career as a third-party candidate in the mayor’s race, in large part by courting Republicans, including Mr. Catsimatidis and his radio listeners.\n\nFor politicians who have been canceled, are washed-up or out of work, radio has long been a refuge. Mr. Cuomo knew the model well: His own father, Mario M. Cuomo, had briefly hosted a nationally syndicated radio show after leaving the New York governor’s mansion in the 1990s. His brother, Chris Cuomo, announced he was starting a podcast in the summer of 2022 after CNN fired him.\n\nFor Andrew Cuomo, Quake Media seemed an odd fit. For $4.99 a month, subscribers could get access to “exclusive” content from hosts that included Laura Ingraham, Soledad O’Brien, Mike Huckabee and Pete Rose as part of a novel “subscription podcast network,” where the shows were secured behind a paywall.\n\nBut Mr. Cuomo did not exactly have a lot of options. The company started paying him lump sums that would add up to close to $500,000 a year to produce a show every week or two. “As a Matter of Fact …” rolled out in fall 2022, billed as the Democrat’s big public re-emergence.\n\n“I’m doing it because I’m worried about this country,” Mr. Cuomo said in the first episode.\n\nAn I-know-best politician who had spent his career sparring with journalists, Mr. Cuomo was not exactly a natural host. But he secured splashy guests and attracted attention by using the show to air longstanding grievances against Democrats in “denial” about the scourge of crime, against then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a recent but frequently cited foe, the socialist left.\n\nBehind the scenes, Quake was unraveling. Unbeknown to Mr. Cuomo, the company had lost its corporate charter in May 2022, months before hiring him.\n\nWhen it began missing contractual payments, Ms. Ingraham, better known for her work on Fox News, filed suit, saying the company owed her nearly $1 million. Ms. Ingraham’s lawyer declined to comment.\n\nThe company missed payments to Mr. Cuomo, too, according to the former governor.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview in early June, Mr. Cuomo said the podcast had taken “the majority of my time” for the year or so he was on air and that he enjoyed the challenge of writing scripts. “I took it very seriously,” he said.\n\nBut Mr. Cuomo conceded the company’s founder, Doug Rosenberg, had stiffed him. “He was a nice enough fellow, and the economy sort of changed beneath him,” Mr. Cuomo said. “He has not paid me everything that I’m owed.”\n\n“He said he will, he just needs time,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I said OK.”\n\nQuake went dark in late 2023. Mr. Cuomo’s spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, declined to say how much the former governor was owed.\n\nJames D. Bailey, a lawyer for Mr. Rosenberg, declined to comment on his interactions with Mr. Cuomo.\n\nMr. Cuomo did not, at the time, publicize his situation. Instead, he quietly looked for a lifeline.\n\nEnter Mr. Catsimatidis.\n\nA heterodox Republican who made his fortune off groceries and oil refineries, Mr. Catsimatidis also owned WABC, a talk radio station that he turned into a drive-time juggernaut. The station leans rightward, but it draws a large audience that centrists like Mr. Cuomo covet.\n\nMr. Catsimatidis said he could not remember exactly when Mr. Cuomo approached him, but the former governor made it clear in late 2022 or 2023 that he wanted to move to WABC.\n\n“It wasn’t about money,” the owner said. “He thought he could get double the listeners.”\n\nMr. Catsimatidis consulted his team. They were not interested, three people involved at the time said.\n\nMr. Catsimatidis “didn't think Andrew would be objective enough,” recalled David A. Paterson, Mr. Cuomo’s predecessor as governor and another WABC host. “He would use the mic to go after people that he felt slandered him.”\n\nOthers at the station voiced showmanship concerns. “Basically, I said to the techs, if ever he becomes a podcaster here, I’d want to impale myself with a microphone,” said Curtis Sliwa, a WABC mainstay who is now clashing with Mr. Cuomo as the Republican nominee for mayor. “The guy is boring!”\n\nBy Mr. Azzopardi’s account, the two sides did not come to terms and Mr. Cuomo “ultimately decided it wasn’t something he wanted to pursue.”\n\nThe former governor had started a lucrative parallel consulting business where he earned more than $500,000 in 2024, according to his financial disclosures to the city. Mr. Cuomo has refused to produce a list of his clients, though news media have reported he worked for an embattled cryptocurrency exchange and a nuclear power start-up.\n\nBut he did not completely give up on radio.\n\nThis winter, not long before he announced his campaign for mayor, Mr. Cuomo approached WABC again. This time, he said he was interested in producing a political podcast with Mr. Catsimatidis’s podcasting network, Red Apple.\n\nThe mogul was more receptive. Unlike an on-air show, Mr. Cuomo would be responsible for finding sponsors for a podcast, he said, and would have to share a cut of the revenue with Red Apple.\n\n“He has access to a lot of people with — how do you call it — checks-appeal,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. (After initially supporting Mayor Eric Adams before he dropped his re-election bid, Mr. Catsimatidis has endorsed Mr. Cuomo.)\n\nBut the podcast idea fell apart, in no small thanks to Mr. Sliwa. When Mr. Cuomo came to visit Red Apple’s Midtown Manhattan studios, Mr. Sliwa was live on air.\n\nMr. Sliwa said that studio executives asked him to steer clear of Mr. Cuomo during the visit. He obliged — but decided to state his grievances on air. Mr. Sliwa used his show to accuse Mr. Cuomo of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of nursing home residents from Covid. (Mr. Cuomo denies wrongdoing.)\n\nMr. Cuomo was furious, according to Mr. Catsimatidis and Mr. Sliwa, and he left without a deal.\n\nMr. Azzopardi said Mr. Cuomo had “no recollection of that incident, but Sliwa is an insignificant part of our lives, and until the last debate Cuomo doesn’t remember ever meeting him.”\n\nNow, as Mr. Cuomo seeks to prolong his political career, his brief career in radio may have an afterlife. Two years after she filed it, Ms. Ingraham’s case against Quake has advanced through the courts.\n\nEarlier this month, lawyers for the host and Mr. Rosenberg filed a joint letter to a judge saying they were in advanced settlement talks to compensate Ms. Ingraham. A settlement, they wrote, “will likely include Quake’s intellectual property” — which includes Mr. Cuomo’s old shows.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/dining/whole-foods.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:01:29-04:00","title":"Whole Foods, MAHA and the Battle Over Healthy Eating in America","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Whole Foods Market, founded in 1980 by John Mackey, revolutionized American grocery shopping by promoting organic, sustainable, and health-conscious food.

Over Healthy Eating in America\n\nPublished: 2025-10-29T05:01:29-04:00\n\nThe Whole Foods flagship in Austin is a shrine.\n\nWith its acres of organic and regenerative produce, a craft beer bar with cheese pairings, and seemingly endless shelves of specialty groceries sculpted to perfection by an attentive floor staff, it is a shrine to what fixed Whole Foods Market in the American imagination as a luxuryland of healthy, aspirational eating.\n\nBut with its world headquarters office tower looming overhead, self-service kiosks, harried Whole Foods workers loading carts for pickup customers and grab-and-go shoppers lugging armfuls of ready-to-heat dinners, it is also a physical manifestation of what the brand has become: a mainstream American supermarket.\n\nEven so, the presiding presence of Whole Foods past, John Mackey, who founded the company in 1980 just blocks away and was its chief executive for 32 years, still makes regular pilgrimages to the salad bar, as if checking on his creation.\n\nHe’s not the only one. Tourists also drop by to take photos in front of the store, a testament to the power of the brand.\n\nSince its founding in 1980, Whole Foods has changed the way Americans eat, helping to elevate the organic movement from niche lifestyle to booming product category. It scared Big Food, and shook up retail generally by transforming a dreary chore like grocery shopping into what it called a “sensory experience.”\n\nToday the company has 529 locations in 44 states and Washington, D.C. Its business, which accounts for less than 2 percent of domestic grocery sales, is dwarfed by global giants like Kroger and Walmart. Its profit margins are significantly higher, though, and it continues to be the grocer others emulate when it comes to product offerings.\n\n“I think we’re in a great spot in the industry,” said Jason Buechel, the chief executive since Mr. Mackey’s departure in 2022, citing “the standards we put into place and the consciousness we helped bring to consumers.”\n\nYet in the eight years since it was acquired by Amazon, Whole Foods has found itself searching for a place in the very landscape it redefined. As its prices have come down, its feeling of exclusivity has waned. Competitors caught on to the trends it pioneered. (Costco is now the largest U.S. seller of organic products.) Rival grocers have also built their own emotional attachments with shoppers, a relationship that would have seemed ludicrous before Whole Foods made it a core strategy.\n\nAnd that was before the dramatic takeover of the nutrition debate by the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.\n\nThe MAHA version of the natural-food cause isn’t exactly political friends with the affluent, blue-state progressives who have long been the Whole Foods customer base. And in a moment when Americans are more concerned than ever about eating healthy, the world’s most visible health-conscious grocer has been uncharacteristically reticent.\n\nThe paradox is that Whole Foods, of all brands, should be ready to meet the zeitgeist. After all, John Mackey is a vehement capitalist, a libertarian and a zealot when it comes to eating well. Whole Foods has horseshoe politics in its DNA.\n\n“They’re a straight-up dialectical contradiction,” said Errol Schweizer, a former vice president of the grocery division.\n\n“There has always been a get-out-of-my-face, don’t-tell-me-what-to-do, anti-government, anti-corporation side to the healthy food movement,” said Corby Kummer, executive director of Food & Society at the Aspen Institute. “Whole Foods has always been for people who want to reject the mainstream.”\n\nAlex Clark loves Whole Foods. But she also resents it.\n\nMs. Clark hosts the highly rated podcast “Culture Apothecary with Alex Clark,” part of the Turning Point USA network founded by Charlie Kirk. During the pandemic, she was consuming a diet of ultraprocessed food — “I was at Chick-fil-A, like, four times a week” — when she underwent a conversion.\n\nIn a fit of disgust, she said, she “got rid of everything that had artificial dyes, seed oils and wasn’t organic. I mean, literally everything. I’m that type of person, all in or out. It was full throttle overnight.”\n\nToday in Scottsdale, Ariz., where she lives, Whole Foods has become the “main place that I grocery shop,” she said. (According to her, Mr. Kirk was a frequent shopper there as well.) But it is with growing frustration. She feels that the grocer has been reluctant to embrace MAHA publicly.\n\n“It has to be politically motivated,” she said, “Like: ‘We don’t want to be perceived as Trump supporters,’ which is just ridiculous.” She accused the company of shying away from signature MAHA causes, like opposition to seed oils, and betraying its mission to improve American health.\n\n“The consumer has gotten very smart, and they do notice,” Ms. Clark said. “They do notice Whole Foods’ lack of voice in this movement and wondering where their leadership is in this. We’re starting to look at other stores like Sprouts or Rainbow Blossom or Natural Grocers or just the local mom-and-pop like health food stores that are now popping up.”\n\nShe’d like to tell Whole Foods: “This is the moment that you guys have allegedly fought for your entire existence. Why are you slowing down when you should be ramping up?”\n\nNot everyone sees Whole Foods as distancing itself from the new health movement, however. Indeed, some wish the company would distance itself more.\n\n“MAHA is clobbering public health right now,” said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and a founder of “The Unbiased Science Podcast,” and companies are “jumping on the bandwagon.” She cited Whole Foods as “a place that is feeding into all of the logical fallacies that seed oils are bad, that food colorings are bad, supplements and all the other things that make us in the science space really cringe.”\n\nThat people on both sides of the debate draw such different conclusions about Whole Foods’ stance suggests how murky the company’s messaging has been, just as some other businesses are seizing the opportunity of the MAHA moment.\n\nWhen asked directly about its stance on the movement, the company responded with a written statement: “We welcome the growing recognition that health is closely tied to the food we eat. Whole Foods Market has always been a haven for customers that are seeking more holistic approaches to their wellness, and we plan to stay the course.”\n\nIt’s hard to imagine John Mackey being so cautious.\n\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, the grocer became a symbol of lefty coastal elitism, used as a gag on “Portlandia” and “Modern Family,” and mocked on “South Park” as a cargo cult for conscientious consumers.\n\nBut Mr. Mackey, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was not a progressive himself. He opposed labor unions and campaigned against President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. Although such views would hardly be out of place in many boardrooms, they were often at odds with the prevailing politics of the Whole Foods customer base. (At the time of the 2008 presidential election, 89 percent of Whole Foods stores were in counties won by Mr. Obama.)\n\nMr. Mackey believes in what he calls “conscious capitalism,” an offshoot of libertarianism that venerates both the free market and sustainability. Operationally, he favored a decentralized approach, pitting regional teams against one another and delegating responsibility to lower-level employees.\n\n“It worked,” said Mike Schall, a veteran of Unilever and Wise Foods who came to Whole Foods to work for Mr. Mackey in 2011. “It blows my mind just to think how extraordinary it was.”\n\nMr. Schall spent eight years in Mr. Mackey’s inner circle, engaged in what he described as utopian experiments, like empowering small producers and creating a work force devoted to slinging groceries.\n\n“Whole Foods was a passion player,” Mr. Schall said. “You would walk in the store and feel it. It smelled differently. And the quality, of course, was impeccable.”\n\nDawn Judd, a Bay Area lawyer, started going to the Mill Valley branch of Whole Foods in 1992. According to Ms. Judd, her husband, Mark, was the first customer through the branch’s doors, as employees applauded. She described the store as a kind of fantasy brand, with a “special feeling” because of its dizzying array of products and how “how clean and attractive” it was.\n\n“Fantastic produce, mostly organic, great breads, fantastic juice and coffee bar, delicious prepared food,” she said. Whole Foods’ very existence seemed to shake up the grocery industry, as “suddenly everything was available in healthier versions, organic, lower sugar and so on.”\n\nNot all the contradictions reflected well on the company. While promoting sustainability, Whole Foods priced groceries at levels many Americans could not afford, earning it the nickname “Whole Paycheck.” It also became known as a health food hegemon, bulldozing lesser rivals even as it preached the virtues of small and local.\n\nNevertheless, a mystique developed, an aura of invincibility, of the ability to make almost anything work. In one audacious experiment, for instance, the company set out to build a network of local farmers in Hawaii to supply native staples like taro and papaya, which could be bought more cheaply in California and Mexico.\n\nAt the time, the company was on a breakneck expansion, opening grand new stores in expensive locations, like its flagship operation in Columbus Circle, then the largest supermarket in Manhattan. As a public company, Whole Foods might have focused on generating profits as it grew, but instead it doubled down on Mr. Mackey’s vision, using its market position to challenge the status quo through risky, labor-intensive initiatives like the local supply chain in Hawaii.\n\n“Whole Foods tried to have a soul,” said Mr. Schweizer, the former head of the grocery division. “The way they paid people, the way they encouraged risk-taking. It was more than just decentralization. There was so much education. That took budgeting, that took resources. It was a unique organization and ecosystem to be a part of — and, you know, the best years of my life.”\n\nThe stock market, though, didn’t find the focus on sustainability quite so sustainable.\n\nAfter the 2008 recession, as the appetite for emu eggs and saffron threads cooled, the company’s stock price stagnated. Investors grew disenchanted with Mr. Mackey’s freewheeling leadership style. He found himself increasingly on the defensive, fighting off the “sharks,” he called the investors publicly, who wanted Whole Foods to focus less on serving a “higher purpose” in order to compete with Kroger and Walmart.\n\n“The regional model was really hard to manage,” said Mr. Schweizer, particularly the high labor costs. In the 2010s, Whole Foods submitted to pressure with centralization in Austin and layoffs of between 3,000 and 5,000 store-level employees, Mr. Schweizer said.\n\nAmbitious initiatives like the Hawaiian supply network were abandoned, as “every operational element of the business was being scrutinized to be stripped down as,” Mr. Schall said.\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Mackey made a desperate move, reaching out to Amazon. The $13.7 billion acquisition was concluded within weeks. “It was a shotgun wedding,” Mr. Schall said.\n\nThe deal gave Amazon a foothold it had long coveted in the brick-and-mortar grocery world, and allowed Mr. Mackey to preserve some of his business model. But not all.\n\nTo reach the scale Amazon was after, Whole Foods would have to appeal more broadly across socioeconomic, political and geographic lines.\n\nWhole Foods had built a culture around healthy eating. When Americans on a health kick like Ms. Clark made a decision to change their diet, it was often the first place they turned. The way Whole Foods decided what to offer them — which products satisfied the brand’s definition of healthy, while also having sales potential — was highly dependent on that culture.\n\n“There was this competitive dynamic of not only achieving great performance, but of discovery, of foraging,” Mr. Schall said.\n\nAccording to him and others, Amazon was less interested in that approach.\n\nWhole Foods under Amazon is clearly trying to be more things to more people.\n\nFor a long time “they really saw their competition in a very limited way,” said Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst and the editor of SupermarketGuru. “I think that today they see everybody who sells food as their competition.”\n\nPrices have come down, and the business is going well.\n\n“They’ve broadened their approach, and that’s the smart thing to do,” Mr. Lempert said. “Those die-hard Whole Foods people from generations before, they went to Erewhon. They went to Sprouts. They don’t exist anymore.” Under Amazon, he added, the company is “going after Gen Z, millennials and new generations of shoppers.”\n\n“They’re playing with the big boys now,” Mr. Schweizer said.\n\nSo far, Amazon seems happy with Mr. Buechel’s tenure: This summer it consolidated its entire grocery business, including Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, under his leadership.\n\nAt the supermarkets themselves, things have changed as well, reflecting a more centralized operation. At the Whole Foods on Queen Street in Honolulu, although several items in the produce section are locally grown, including papaya and three kinds of pineapple, most of the inventory comes from thousands of miles away — Peruvian grapes, Mexican watermelon, Vietnamese coconut — and is virtually indistinguishable from what you’d find at a Whole Foods in Austin or Manhattan.\n\n“I have definitely seen it become not bad, just less good,” said Ms. Judd, the Bay Area shopper. She added that as higher quality food has become available elsewhere, “Whole Foods has been less rare and special feeling.”\n\nShe added, “I don’t really want to put my grocery shopping dollars in the pocket of Bezos,” referring to Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos.\n\nAnother change is that as Whole Foods has become less visible publicly, others have stepped into the pulpit where it used to lead the healthy food movement.\n\n“Originally the movement was liberal,” said Sonalie Figueiras, editor of the progressive food website Green Queen Media. “Now it’s right-wing. Where is Whole Foods in the story? They moved the needle on food culture. They mainstreamed a lot of these things.”\n\n“The left led the way on health and wellness for a long time,” Ms. Clark said. “I don’t know why, but they handed the baton to the right.”\n\nBut there may be signs that the company is still looking to read the cultural winds.\n\nRecently, it introduced a new design for its shopping bags, covering them with the slogan “It’s What’s Not in the Bag,” and a list of all 562 ingredients the company bans from its shelves.\n\n“When I saw those bags, I thought the message they’re sending is ‘Everyone’s talking about this now, but we’ve been in the trenches,’” said Helena Bottemiller Evich, a former Politico reporter who runs the influential blog Food Fix. “Of course they did it without touching MAHA as a topic. It was very subtle, and also not subtle.”\n\nFollow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

The rest of the cuts, some of which will affect Paramount’s international employees, will come later.\n\nOverall, Paramount is planning to cut roughly 10 percent of the combined company.\n\nIn a memo to employees Wednesday, Mr. Ellison said that the cuts were focused on eliminating redundant jobs or phasing out positions not in keeping with Paramount’s evolving priorities.\n\n“These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,” Mr. Ellison said in the memo.\n\nParamount employees, who have been subjected to near-annual corporate reorganizations, have been bracing for layoffs for months. When Skydance announced its merger with Paramount last year, the company said it was looking for $2 billion in synergies, Wall Street argot for cost-cutting.\n\nMr. Ellison signaled earlier this year that major changes were coming. In September, he sent a memo telling employees they would be expected to return to the office five days a week in the coming months.

in the Netherlands head to the polls on Wednesday in elections, one issue will stand out as the most important for many, especially younger people: a rising shortage of affordable housing.\n\nFor large groups of students, graduates beginning work, young adults ready to start families and people looking for social housing, finding an affordable home or buying a property in the Netherlands has become nearly impossible.\n\nToo many people are looking for homes, and there are not enough available. That has plunged many Dutch cities into an affordability crisis, for renters as well as for prospective home owners.\n\n“I’d prefer to live by myself, but that’s impossible, even though I earn enough,” said Charlotte Stienstra, 33, a project manager in Amsterdam.\n\nWhen her long-term relationship ended last year, she moved out of the house she had been renting since she was a student, hoping to buy a place. But getting on the property ladder proved unattainable. Instead, Ms. Stienstra moved in with a roommate in the northern part of Amsterdam, an area with a lot of new construction.\n\n“It’s pretty much a full-time job on the side to find something,” she said.\n\nThe problems on the housing market in the Netherlands are the result of a near perfect storm many years in the making, experts say.\n\nThe population has grown more over the past decade than the government expected because of an influx of migrants, a mix of workers, expats, students and refugees. At the same time, the average size of households has shrunk — people are living alone more often and longer — increasing the necessity for more, often smaller, homes.\n\nAnd since the economic crisis of 2008-9, not enough new homes have been built to keep up with the demand, Peter Boelhouwer, a professor of housing systems at Delft University of Technology, said in a phone interview. Building new homes in the Netherlands comes with many local rules and environmental regulations, which can delay the number of homes being built.\n\nTogether, these factors have contributed to an estimated shortage of roughly 400,000 homes in the Netherlands, or about 5 percent of the housing stock, according to the Dutch research firm ABF Research.\n\n“There’s an accessibility problem,” said Hans Koster, a professor of urban economics and real estate at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “There isn’t much left for first-time buyers or expats.”\n\nPoliticians across the spectrum call housing one of the country’s main issues, but no single party has been able to take clear ownership of the situation, according to a recent poll, although many have ideas.\n\nD66, a center-left party, has promised to build 10 new cities.\n\nThe left-wing alliance between the Labor Party and the Green Party, placed second in the polls, called public housing its “top priority” and proposed on its website a tax on landlords’ vacant properties.\n\nThe far-right Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders, which has the largest share of seats in the House of Representatives and has been leading the polls, wants a “crisis plan” and “fewer rules.” Mr. Wilders, who has long campaigned against migration, has also said he wants to stop giving asylum seekers who have valid permits to stay in the country priority to social housing.\n\nThe group of people Mr. Wilders is talking about makes up about 13 percent of people waiting for social housing in Amsterdam, said Anne-Jo Visser, the director of the Amsterdam Federation of Housing Associations. “That’s not how we’re going to solve the big problem,” she said.\n\nThe wait time for one of Amsterdam’s roughly 190,000 affordable housing units is just under 10 years, Ms. Visser said.\n\nBesides first-time buyers and people looking for social housing, middle-income renters are also having trouble.\n\nThe number of private rentals has dropped, partly because of a 2024 affordable rent law that has made it less financially attractive for landlords to rent out properties, causing many of them to sell their properties instead.\n\nThis is the problem that Elisha van Kouwen, 25, a medical student in her final year, has encountered. Her landlord is selling the building where she shares an apartment with two friends, she said.\n\nPriced out of the rental market, Ms. van Kouwen said she would move back in with her parents in the city of Utrecht. “You’ve built a life somewhere,” Ms. van Kouwen said, “but it’s very difficult to find a place to live.”\n\nIsa Kashi, 27, moved to the Netherlands a year ago from the United States to complete a master’s degree in Amsterdam, and said she had been surprised at how difficult it was to find a place to live. “There’s just constant stress about housing among my friends here,” she said. “It’s constant worry simmering in the background.”\n\nMs. Kashi moved to the Netherlands from New York, she said, a city with a housing crisis of its own and rising rent prices. Still, she said, finding an apartment to rent in Amsterdam had proved even more difficult.\n\n“In New York, I feel like you’ll find something. There’s enough inventory,” she said. “Here, there just straight up aren’t enough places.”\n\nRosanne Kropman contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/world/europe/when-caregiving-makes-women-ill.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:43:22-04:00","title":"When Caregiving Makes Women Ill","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the emergence and expansion of the 'Italy Syndrome'—a psychological condition affecting women from Eastern Europe who return from long-term caregiving jobs in Italy.

all the other patients,” Dr. Andriy Kiselyov, a psychiatrist, remembered telling a colleague. They had a form of depression that did not respond to traditional treatment.\n\nThe women shared another trait. Both were returning from working as caregivers in Italy.\n\nSoon, he started to notice that others who had returned were similarly affected. He and his colleague started informally referring to the malaise as the “Italy syndrome.”\n\nThat was 20 years ago in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, when, needing to feed their families, many women from across Eastern Europe migrated to Italy to fill its expanding need for elder care.\n\nIn the decades since, doctors across Eastern Europe have adopted the term, not as a scientific or medical diagnosis but as casual shorthand to describe caregivers’ psychological distress.\n\nThe term is now familiar to groups representing caregivers’ employers, and to the women who whisper among themselves about the insomnia, anguish and depression they feel after spending years away from their families tending to older, often disabled people abroad, in near-confinement with them.\n\n“The fact that such a syndrome has the name of the country that raised me gives me goose bumps,” said Maria Grazia Vergari, an Italian psychologist who has focused on foreign care workers.\n\nThe women’s suffering is a hidden cost of a labor migration that has become increasingly essential in Italy, which has the oldest population on average in the European Union, and a vital financial lifeline for many immigrants.\n\nDespite the distress being first identified with Italy’s name, migrant care work is a global phenomenon, with thousands of workers from Moldova, Ukraine and Romania, but also Peru or the Philippines tending to the older in much of Western Europe.\n\nFar from all workers return home damaged. Yet the syndrome has rippled through Europe not only geographically, but generationally. Doctors say they are also diagnosing mental health and behavioral problems in children who stayed back while their mothers were absent.\n\nThere is now a “post-Italy syndrome,” too, said Dr. Cristina Elena Dobre, the manager of the Socola Institute of Psychiatry in Romania, the country where most of Italy’s care workers come from.\n\n“You have a beautiful house, you have some money in your account,” Dr. Dobre said, “but you have a totally shattered family.”\n\nThe Socola psychiatric hospital, a sprawling 19th-century complex, is nestled in the verdant woods of eastern Romania. The surrounding countryside is dotted with quaint houses adorned with rose bushes and cherry trees, many of them built with remittances from legions of Romanian women who left to work abroad.\n\nEven today, a quarter of Romanians live outside Romania, once an impoverished Soviet satellite.\n\nAmong those who left was Corina Vasiloaia, now 48, who moved in with an older Italian couple in the Tuscan city of Pistoia.\n\nAfter two years, Ms. Vasiloaia said in a recent interview at her house in Romania, one of her employers developed dementia and had manic attacks and hallucinations. She would shout and ask to eat breakfast in the middle of the night, Ms. Vasiloaia said.\n\nSoon she could not sleep either, she said, and started fearing she would “go mad.” Slowly, she started hearing voices. She initially brushed them off, but they continued, until one day she ran out of the house shouting.\n\n“I was screaming to God, ‘God, help me, come and get me out!’”\n\nMs. Vasiloaia was hospitalized in Italy, then in Romania. She did not have any pre-existing conditions, said her doctor, Raluca Modoranu, the primary psychiatrist at Socola, but five years after returning from Italy, she is still under medication.\n\n“Before going to Italy,” she said, “I was fine.”\n\nRomania’s health ministry has acknowledged the existence of “Italy Syndrome” but does not keep an official tally of those affected, making the scope of the phenomenon hard to gauge. A spokesman for Socola hospital said doctors there had treated more than 900 patients with the syndrome since 2016. Doctors at Socola say some of those have experienced burnout, psychosis and attempted suicide.\n\nDr. Modoranu said she was following dozens of patients whose syndrome had become chronic.\n\nSleep deprivation often combines with other factors that are typical of caregiving jobs, doctors said.\n\nLive-in caregivers are expected to be available 24 hours a day, unlike nurses in hospitals or retirement homes who have special training, shifts, private lives and homes.\n\nUnlike other migrants, the women working as caregivers often cannot take their children with them. They are likely to witness the deaths of the patients they have single-mindedly dedicated themselves to.\n\nWhile many women recount positive experiences in Italy, with understanding and generous employers, for some the difficulty of work spent cleaning, bathing, dressing and feeding is compounded by the fact that they are highly educated professionals like engineers, teachers, architects.\n\n“These people were completely erased by care work,” Dr. Vergari said.\n\nThat was the case for Veronica Durughian, 73, a doctor who left Moldova because her wages were low and often went unpaid.\n\nIn Italy, she worked for a nonverbal woman with Alzheimer’s disease, then for another one who called for her parents all night. A third woman she cared for was constantly hostile, criticizing her every move.\n\n“I cried for no reason, I got up in the morning and cried and I did not sleep at night,” she said. “It ruined me.”\n\nShe was prescribed antidepressants, which she continued to take for about a decade.\n\nNow back in Moldova after about 20 years in Italy, she attends learning programs for retired women, many of whom have also returned from Italy.\n\n“Many of us have that syndrome,” she said. “Many of us bear the scars.”\n\nExperts have described a “caregiver syndrome” for those who look after chronic patients, and also a “Ulysses syndrome” — the mourning for home that affects many migrants.\n\nIn a way, “Italy syndrome” combines both.\n\nItaly has introduced some measures to improve work conditions, but regulating an industry largely hidden within a family’s private household remains difficult. Nearly half of all domestic workers are still employed off the books, leaving them particularly vulnerable.\n\nLorenzo Gasparrini, the secretary general of Domina, a group of employers of care workers, has called for tax breaks for Italian families so they can afford to legalize the workers, and organizes workshops to prepare the workers for the job.\n\n“You cannot take away their suffering,” said Mr. Gasparrini. “But you can alleviate it.”\n\nThe need for caregivers shows no signs of abating. In Italy, there are about 1.6 million domestic workers, most of them migrant women, and about half of them care for old people, according to a recent study by Domina.\n\nCases of dementia are also on the rise in Italy, but cultural norms and a stagnant economy make it difficult for families to take their parents to nursing homes.\n\n“It would be like abandoning him,” said Marzia Meloni, 28, whose family employs a full-time Romanian care worker in Rome for her grandfather, who has Alzheimer’s.\n\nMs. Meloni said the family was doing its best to pay their caregiver a fair salary and allow her to spend a month back home every year. But, she acknowledged, “It’s tiring work,” adding, “I could not cope with leaving my family.”\n\nNow, a generation into the wave of migration from Eastern Europe, the effects of the Italy syndrome have metastasized in many families. The children of women who left home are showing up in psychiatric wards, too.\n\nMihail Tamba was only 8 when his mother left Moldova for Italy to work as a caregiver. He hoped that, like his cousins, he would receive toys and new clothes from abroad. When she returned, bringing a jar of Nutella, Mihail said he could not recognize her.\n\nHe struggled to connect with her, he said. For most of his youth, his mother continued to come and go from Italy, and Mihail lived with uncles and neighbors, but mostly with his stepfather, who drank and was prone to violent attacks.\n\n“There was nobody around to protect me,” Mr. Tamba, now 30, said. “That’s when my depression started,” he added.\n\n“We had to go through abandonment, through solitude, through everything only to be fed,” he said. “And this is something very painful.”\n\nDoctors in Romania say they are alarmed at the rate at which youths who grew up without their mothers are now suffering from depression, attachment issues, substance abuse, ADHD and even attempted suicide.\n\nLoredana Balan, a child psychologist in the Romanian city of Suceava, said that last year nearly half of her patients had at least one parent working abroad, and 15 percent had a mother in Italy.\n\nLucia, 58, a Moldovan care worker who asked to be identified only by her first name because she is still working with a family in Verona, said that after she arrived in Italy in the early 2000s, her daughter tried to kill herself at 16.\n\nNow Lucia gets up at night, thinking she is hearing the older woman she cares for calling her, only to find her asleep. But despite being “sick with stress and solitude,” she is not going home.\n\n“Nobody is waiting for me at home anymore,” Lucia said. When she sees her children, she added, “they are like strangers.”\n\nDzvinka Pinchuk contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/climate/klamath-salmon-recovery.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:03:35-04:00","title":"A River Restoration in Oregon Gets Fast Results: The Salmon Swam Right Back","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After over a century of absence, Chinook salmon have returned to the headwaters of the Klamath River in Oregon, marking a major ecological and cultural milestone.

The dams had blocked salmon and other fish from traveling upriver. They were removed in 2023 and 2024, the culmination of decades of efforts by Native American groups — including the Yurok, Karuk and Klamath tribes — along with environmental organizations, anglers and others.\n\n“It was both a blessing and filled with remorse,” said William E. Ray, Jr., chairman of the Klamath tribes. Many people had “fought hard all those decades” for the restoration effort, he said, and would not see the results. But, he added, “it was also very joyous.”\n\nThe Klamath River runs about 260 miles from its headwaters in south-central Oregon to the northern California coast, emptying into the Pacific near the town of Klamath. For thousands of years, it had robust populations of salmon, trout and other migratory fish that are central to the diets and cultures of the tribes that live along its banks.\n\nBy the early 1900s, settlers were eyeing the river for its irrigation and hydropower potential. The four dams recently removed were built between 1912 and 1962. They, along with smaller dams, canals and water diversions, blocked the passage of fish and altered the river habitat. Populations of Chinook salmon, historically the most abundant fish in the Klamath, dwindled to near zero and disappeared completely upriver from the dams.\n\n“These fisheries made up half our diet” and were important for medicines, Mr. Ray said. Losing the salmon “pecked away at the tribes’ viability, our ability to exercise and protect our living culture.”\n\nDemolition on the last dam was completed in October of 2024. Just days later, salmon were swimming upstream, passing through the former dam sites and heading for Upper Klamath Lake, the last stop before the smaller tributary streams where they would spawn.\n\nBut a few obstacles remained, and biologists weren’t sure the salmon could get around them. Several remaining dams had fish ladders, the ascending artificial pools and falls meant to help fish bypass dams and other infrastructure on their way upstream. But they were built decades ago, not to modern specifications, and designed for trout, not salmon.\n\nScientists rushed to get equipment in place to track the progress of the salmon and see whether they could navigate the old ladders. As scientists were installing the cameras in late September this year, salmon were already swimming through.\n\n“That was incredible,” said Mark Hereford, a project lead for the restoration effort with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nOne of those cameras captured a Chinook salmon leaping up one of those older fish ladders, providing the first documentation of the salmons’ progress upriver. Scientists then equipped some fish with trackable radio tags as they passed through the fish ladders.\n\nThe tagged fish proved to be pioneers. The trackers revealed that by mid-October, a few dozen salmon had swum roughly 30 miles through Upper Klamath Lake and reached tributaries of the Klamath, considered the river’s headwaters. One year after the last of the dams came down, salmon are spreading throughout the uppermost reaches of the river.\n\n“We were ecstatic,” Mr. Hereford said. “We didn’t know how long it would take. But to have them up here a year and a couple weeks since the last dam’s removal is pretty incredible.”\n\nScientists have been cruising the tributaries on paddle boards, counting salmon. They estimate, conservatively, that at least 140 adult fish are spawning in the tributaries as of late October.\n\nIt will very likely take years for the salmon to fully recover. Water quality in the Upper Klamath is a concern. Agricultural runoff has polluted the watershed with phosphorus, rendering some water bodies unsafe for drinking or swimming. And a network of irrigation canals threatens to divert fish away from tributaries.\n\nFunding is also a question mark. The Klamath tribes and other groups involved in the restoration work have received millions of dollars from the federal government, but recent delays and grant cancellations have created uncertainty around what work will be able to proceed.\n\nThe Klamath tribes, for instance, had more than $3.1 million in funding from the U.S. government promised to help with restoration efforts, including the installation of screens to prevent salmon from ending up in irrigation canals.\n\n“That’s been tied up since November of 2024,” Mr. Ray said. “And that’s not just for the hard restoration work. That’s also for our crew of tribal members who rely on that for their jobs and their income.”\n\nBut after so many decades without salmon in the Klamath River, the tribes are celebrating the conservation success. “This is a renewal of our culture that we’ve had for thousands of years,” Mr. Ray said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/opinion/nazi-tattoo-graham-platner-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:03:43-04:00","title":"A Nazi Tattoo Exposes Democrats’ Greatest Weakness","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the controversy surrounding Graham Platner, a progressive Democratic Senate candidate in Maine, who has a Nazi-style Totenkopf tattoo acquired in 2007 during a Marine leave in Croatia.

a progressive candidate for U.S. Senate in Maine, to understand why so many Democrats have been frothing at the mouth over his candidacy for months. His beefy tattooed arms and weathered face made him look like a live-action Popeye. He’s often styled in a dirty ball cap and ragged T-shirt, implying a sort of everyman machismo.\n\nIt’s the kind of look that suggests Platner could be the Democratic Party’s new great white hope — a working-class white man who can speak to class antagonism in an economically unequal electorate.\n\nThere’s just one teensy-weensy problem. It turns out that friend-of-the-white-working-class had a Nazi tattoo.\n\nThe tattoo resembles a Totenkopf, a well-known symbol of official Nazis, the Nazi-adjacent and people who just think that Nazi iconography is tough. The gist is that Platner got the tattoo in 2007 in Croatia when he was on leave with his fellow Marines. Platner has said that he didn’t know the symbol’s semiotics. He only knew that Marines get “terrifying-looking” tattoos.\n\n(It’s worth stating that Platner’s former political director has questioned his claim of ignorance. The campaign said the director’s allegation was a “a lie from a disgruntled former employee.”)\n\nPlatner’s campaign has been busy handling the fallout from the tattoo and his Reddit comment history, which was sometimes racist, misogynistic and homophobic and sometimes antifascist and antiracist. It’s the kind of messiness the internet inculcates. No one with a social media history is pure. After 18 years sporting what may or may not have been a symbol of the SS, Platner announced last week that he had the tattoo covered up. We are far enough away from his Democratic primary next June that all this should end up as just another weird little political story in an extraordinary political moment in American history.\n\nOr it would, except over the weekend, several prominent Democrats took time out of their remaining days on God’s green earth to lecture Democratic voters on learning to forgive.\n\nChris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Platner sounds like a mistake-making human being who was, like so many soldiers, going through a “difficult time.” The tattoo, his words implied, shouldn’t worry us too much. Platner is a man who can speak to “working-class concerns,” and that is what the party must prioritize.\n\nBernie Sanders, the longtime senator from Vermont, also had plenty to say. He had endorsed Platner early in his campaign. After the tattoo debacle, Sanders did not revoke his endorsement, saying that there are “more important issues” worth our focus.\n\nBernie’s got us there. There are more important issues. A gilded, would-be emperor is sitting atop the wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world. How did he get there? A cosplay of economic populism that elevated a fixture of the tabloid press to the captain’s chair of Western democracy. It was turbocharged by his willingness to cozy up to radical right-wing racists, promising them legal, political and cultural clemency for their racist deeds.\n\nNow, Republican politicians are free to steep themselves in white Christian nationalism to play to the base that Donald Trump built for them. This country is being ruled by a powerful minority that espouses deplorable minority views that polling shows a majority of voters in this country disagree with. That is the big problem.\n\nIt is also the same problem as a guy wearing a Nazi tattoo.\n\nI cannot swear to know the minds of men like Murphy and Sanders. But, were I a betting person, I’d wager someone else’s riches that they know racism and xenophobia are inextricably linked to America’s inchoate understanding of class politics. They know that “working class” has become a powerful political totem of its own — a discursive sleight of hand used to separate out white voters’ concerns as more legitimate, more materially grounded, more important than other voters’ concerns.\n\nThese senators are demonstrating a willful blindness that has become endemic in the Democratic Party. Their rhetoric — and the conventional wisdom that flows from it — suggests that we cannot talk about economic solutions without abandoning our commitment to the Black, Latino, gay, transgender and female poor that are the lifeblood of the Democratic Party’s base. The conceit at the heart of that belief is that poor white people are too racist, and too uniquely ignorant of their racism, to vote in their best interests. Therefore, Democrats have to accept a little racism to win the working class.\n\nIt is an old argument. History will tell you that negotiating with racism or fascism or authoritarianism never ends well.\n\nIt is also a cop-out that can sound like political pragmatism: The idea that we simply must learn to overlook bad behavior as mere human foibles. Who among us, it is implied, has not said or done or etched a hateful symbol of exclusion and oppression into our minds or bodies? If Democrats are to win back the “working class” that they have lost to Trump, they have to look beyond silly things like Nazi iconography or a little casual racism or a soupçon of sexism and anything else that the “woke” left of the party cares about.\n\nI find it hard to imagine that we would be having this conversation at all were Platner anything other than a fit middle-aged white guy who dresses like a stock photo of a “real man.” Our culture is built to eternally forgive men, generally, and white men of means, especially, for their mistakes. Every single time, they were young and immature and it would be a shame to hold them accountable for anything they did wrong. The rest of us just need to be strong-armed into the forgiving and forgetting portion of the program.\n\nThat is how you get to the place I found myself this week, reading apologia for a hateful symbol pretending to be sound, hard-nosed political analysis.\n\nNow, I know for a fact that the working class in this country looks more like a Latino woman who cleans houses than it looks like Platner, a former defense contractor turned oyster farmer with some leftist political beliefs.\n\nI also know a lot of actual poor white people. The kind of poor white people who don’t even make enough or have enough to be counted among the working class. The people who rely on SNAP benefits for their meals and emergency rooms for their health care.\n\nSometimes they subsist on a diet of racist notions to explain why their lives are as hard as they are. Sometimes those poor white people even have racist tattoos. I live in the South. There is no shortage of Confederate flags and “Don’t tread on me” tags on display in hot, humid months.\n\nOnce, at a meeting with tenant organizers in the center of white American poverty in Appalachia, a young white guy showed up to a meeting with his Stars and Bars tattoo on display. The poor white rural women and working-class Black women who run those meetings took this guy to task. They told him (colorfully) to get himself together. And the next week they all protested their landlord together.\n\nTheir coalition-building wasn’t the kind of kumbaya that Platner apologists are talking about, where a room full of people were expected to swallow their outrage to preserve one man’s feelings. There was accountability. There was education. And there was meaningful action. There was not a college degree or a political donor among them, and yet, somehow, actual poor people figured out how to handle racist iconography without scapegoating minorities or making excuses for a white man’s mistakes.\n\nHere’s the thing. The Democratic Party has a problem. The party’s leaders think they have a problem with Trump voters. Some polling says white men without college degrees don’t like them, don’t trust them and won’t vote for them, so they think the only logical way forward is to pander. Their polling addiction ignores more complex political instruments telling them that the working class isn’t just white men and that centrism isn’t enough to bring white voters back into the fold.\n\nIt is going to take hard politics. The kind that shows up in communities between elections and solves problems that don’t sound glamorous on television talk shows. It looks like facing down the Klan in a trailer park, not complaining about racism while doing far too little to avert it. It means believing that racism is not a natural condition of poverty but a political weapon that rich men use to constrain poor people’s political power. And — most critically — it looks like not wanting, even for a second, to be confused with the people who would do that. You don’t wear a red hat as a joke. You don’t fly the ironic flag of historical hate to get a rise out of people. You don’t wear the cool tattoo for over a decade that maybe, kind of, possibly, probably looks like something horrible and hateful.\n\nIt is a remarkably low bar to clear. And a white working-class aesthetic is not nearly enough to clear it. Real working-class politics does not assume the worst of working-class people’s impulses. It does not launder their concerns for political points. It certainly does not argue, directly or indirectly, that a little racism is a good thing for reaching them.\n\nI don’t particularly care about the symbols people use to signal their membership in a group. Maybe you do need a terrifying tattoo to be a real Marine. And maybe sometimes that terrifying tattoo might resemble Nazi iconography. If you are willing to accept that from a distance, as many Democrats say they are, a person may not be able to tell the real symbol of hate from its doppelgänger, that is for you to live with.\n\nBut, I do care about the political trade-offs we will ask people to make in the name of pragmatism. If the Democratic future requires us to exchange our discomfort with casual Nazism to advance a political agenda, I am not interested. Maybe other voters are — some polling suggests that young voters still support Platner. And maybe Platner will find a way to redeem himself. No one owes him that chance, but there is still a way forward. It’s called doing the work.\n\nBut don’t tell me that excusing that tattoo is good politics. It is the exact same politics that the right is selling, in a different outfit.\n\nPoor people can be self-determined. They prove it every day, mostly by surviving while being poor in a country that is mean and nasty and hostile to them. There is a rich history of multiracial, cross-class organizing in this country, even in the South, where so many people pretend racism is just too strident for working-class politics to thrive.\n\nIf that history exists and if that culture still thrives in the poorest corners of our country, why do so many people feel the need to work so hard to redeem a man who had a Nazi tattoo?\n\nThat’s a question for Democrats.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Instead, Mr. Ciattarelli has shoehorned some policies and rhetoric popular with President Trump’s base into his own long-held message about the financial ills of the state.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli’s current pitch to voters includes many themes from his first gubernatorial campaign eight years ago, including his emphasis on lowering property taxes and a school funding formula he sees as harming suburban and rural communities.\n\nBut they are now accompanied by Trumpian flourishes, decrying “open borders” and “sanctuary cities” and praising the president’s signature legislative achievement, the One Big Beautiful Bill. He has appeared with vaccine skeptics and ridiculed transgender athletes. He has campaigned with Vivek Ramaswamy, the Trump-emulating Republican candidate for governor in Ohio, and far-right media luminaries like Jack Posobeic.\n\nHe studiously avoids making the president a key character in his pitch to voters, and largely avoids referring to Mr. Trump by name. But asked in a debate to grade Mr. Trump on his tenure so far, he gave him an “A.”\n\nIt is a dramatic departure from Mr. Ciattarelli’s first campaign for governor. That effort featured a wonky, statistics-driven stump speech on economic issues, accompanied by a plain-text PowerPoint presentation and occasional open criticism of Mr. Trump, whom he had earlier called a “charlatan” and “not fit to be president.”\n\nFour years later, when he ran for a second time, Mr. Ciattarelli railed against the shutdown policies of the Covid pandemic, tiptoeing closer to the MAGA wing of the Republican Party, though he remained critical of Mr. Trump’s actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\n\n“He’s 180 degrees from where he was in ’17,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who ran some of former Gov. Chris Christie’s campaigns. “Jack has done a good job of understanding that there are certain things that are out of your control. And one of the things that’s out of your control is how other people feel about Donald Trump. And so what he’s trying to do is make sure people know that he agrees with Trump on certain things, but has a different style.”\n\nSuch an approach amounts to a bet not yet tested in a competitive election since Mr. Trump’s return to power last year: that the margins in a close race can be made up by tacking closer to the Republican base in a general election, and that Trump supporters will turn out even without Mr. Trump atop the ticket.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the shift is endorsed by the president.\n\nIn pledging his support for Mr. Ciattarelli this year, Mr. Trump recognized his change. “Jack, who after getting to know and understand MAGA, has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!),” the president wrote on social media.\n\nOf course, in his race against Representative Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee, Mr. Ciattarelli is not simply playing to the president’s base. Earlier this month, he received the endorsement of Nicholas Sacco, the Democratic mayor of North Bergen, the latest in a string of Democratic mayors breaking with their party to side with the Republican candidate.\n\nNavigating the Trump administration has not always been simple. Over the past few weeks, the president promoted a conspiracy theory about Tylenol, causing Mr. Ciattarelli to distance himself from that report. Then, Mr. Trump announced he had “terminated” the Gateway Project, the most critical and expensive infrastructure project in modern New Jersey history.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli’s close-but-not-too-close-to-Trump strategy was on display last week on the eve of the start of early voting.\n\nWith the Democratic cavalry — former President Barack Obama, current governors and future party leaders — descending on New Jersey to support Ms. Sherrill, Mr. Trump instead hopped on the phone.\n\nThere would be no photo ops, nor any risk of energizing the anti-Trump Democratic base with a personal appearance by the president in the state.\n\nInstead, the president and the candidate held a “telephone rally,” an old-school, audio-only event where supporters could dial into a phone number provided by the Ciattarelli campaign to listen to Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli emphasized his gratitude, saying how “thankful” he was to Mr. Trump three times in his 50-second introduction.\n\nMr. Trump, in turn, repeatedly praised Mr. Ciattarelli as “fantastic” and attacked Ms. Sherrill and the “radical left.”\n\nThe entire event lasted 12 minutes.\n\nA third-generation Italian American from New Jersey with a preference for Frank Sinatra over Bruce Springsteen, Mr. Ciattarelli arrived in Trenton nearly 14 years ago as a freshman assemblyman with an accountant’s background and a hope that Republicans could pass some reforms with Mr. Christie, a Republican, in the State House.\n\nDeclan O’Scanlon, a veteran Republican legislator, recalled meeting Mr. Ciattarelli on the floor of the State Assembly on his first day. It took “seven minutes and 37 seconds” into their first conversation, Mr. O’Scanlon recalled, to realize he had a new legislative partner.\n\nBut Mr. O’Scanlon said it was also evident that Mr. Ciattarelli would grow restless in the legislature. In 2015, with accusations of corruption swirling around Senator Robert Menendez, Mr. Ciattarelli’s name came up as a potential candidate.\n\nInstead, Mr. Ciattarelli announced his candidacy for governor in October 2016.\n\nHis campaign was centered around presentations made on PowerPoint slides in the meeting rooms of chain hotels, as he tried to win voters over with statistics on school funding. His pitch started with a family photograph, as Mr. Ciattarelli mixed the slapstick comedy of a motivational speaker with the analytical obsessions of a tax accountant. He pledged to be above the partisan fray.\n\n“I’m not rigid in my ideology,” he said in June 2017 at a campaign stop in Hasbrouck Heights. “I’m not a hyper partisan. I’m about solving problems.”\n\nAs a relative unknown, Mr. Ciattarelli lost his first bid in the primary to Kim Guadagno, then the lieutenant governor to Mr. Christie, by 15 points. Unbowed, he vowed to run again.\n\nBy 2021, though many in the state still considered him a moderate Republican after the launch of his second campaign, Mr. Ciattarelli took a decidedly more combative approach.\n\nWith the polarized politics from the pandemic still raw, Mr. Ciattarelli seized on discontent over the state’s strict lockdown policies, putting him in line with more of the Trump base, though with rarely any mention of Mr. Trump himself.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Ciattarelli was determined to make the pandemic about the state’s Democratic governor, Philip D. Murphy, blaming him for the deaths of seniors in nursing homes in the early days of the crisis.\n\nHe focused intensely on mask mandates, especially in schools, claiming that masks inhibited learning and that parents — not the governor — should be able to choose.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli walked a finer line on vaccinations. While he tepidly opposed requirements, he spoke encouragingly of the vaccine.\n\n“I’m vaccinated, and I certainly would advocate for it again,” Mr. Ciattarelli said in an interview with local media in 2021. “I understand people not wanting to make the choice. I support their right to not make that choice, but I would certainly advocate for it.”\n\nIn a subsequent interview, Mr. Ciattarelli praised Mr. Trump’s leadership in fast-tracking the vaccine, a project known as Operation Warp Speed.\n\nBut he sought to keep his distance from the election denier movement that followed Mr. Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, culminating in the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nAnd he spoke forcefully about the mayhem at the Capitol, calling Jan. 6 “a very, very sad day in our nation’s history.” “The president’s rhetoric on that day,” he said, contributed to the riot.\n\nIn November 2021, his newly combative campaign brought him within three points of Mr. Murphy, a shocking result in a race most polls had as a runaway victory for the Democratic incumbent.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli’s concession speech included a promise: He would run again — and begin immediately.\n\nRunning for governor for four years straight offers a lot of opportunities to show up at party functions and build relationships with the many fiefs that control New Jersey politics.\n\n“He continued to go to every pancake breakfast around the state,” said Alexandra Wilkes, a Republican operative who worked on his 2021 campaign. “And on multiple levels — county level, municipal level, different clients — if they needed something, we called Jack. Like, oh, I need a speaker. I need a check. I need something. Just call Jack and he was always there.”\n\nOften, he could be found in diners. Mr. Ciattarelli frequently cites a desire to win over “all 600 diners” in the state. (His preferred diner order: a BLT on toasted rye, to help him keep a “32 waist.” But if he has extra time, it’s a bowl of onion soup “without the cheese on top.”)\n\nHis relationship-building extended across the aisle. After the Democratic primary for governor in June, Mr. Ciattarelli called Mayor Steven Fulop of Jersey City, who lost to Ms. Sherrill, and left a voice mail message complimenting him on the race. He has since kept in touch with the mayor, who was critical of Ms. Sherrill during their primary battle, but endorsed her the night she became the Democratic nominee.\n\n“He’s a very savvy, relationship-driven person,” Mr. Fulop said. “He’s nurturing a lot of relationships that the Democrats kind of take for granted.”\n\nThe election of Mr. Trump and recent Republican gains in the state crystallized for Mr. Ciattarelli that he needed to run a different kind of race in 2025. Gone would be any criticism of Mr. Trump. Instead, he would wrap his core policies with nods to Trumpism.\n\n“They worry about pronouns, I worry about property taxes,” Mr. Ciattarelli said during a Republican primary debate.\n\nThe approach during the primary — lead with MAGA, finish with Jack — netted him the coveted endorsement of Mr. Trump over a Republican rival who was decidedly to the right of Mr. Ciattarelli on many issues.\n\nIn the general election, there has been little moderating of his message. He still proclaims his No. 1 executive order will be “ending sanctuary cities” while blaming “illegals” for many of the state’s ills. He vows to unshackle police officers to be more aggressive in a “law and order” state.\n\nBut he’s no longer airing the “Trump Backs Jack” digital ads that he ran in the primary campaign. Indeed, his entire ad campaign is devoid of Mr. Trump, except for one ad in which he blasts his opponent for repeatedly invoking the president.\n\n“Come on,” he says in the ad. “What does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?”\n\nBut as Mr. Ciattarelli has tried to walk a careful political line, the world of MAGA has tried to claim him as one of their own.\n\nIn mid-October, the chairman of the Cape May Republican Party organized a rally titled “America First: Return to the Wildwoods,” a reference to a raucous rally Mr. Trump held in 2024 that drew tens of thousands of people to Wildwood, N.J.\n\nThis year, Mr. Trump did not attend, but the event had all the trappings of a modern MAGA gathering: far-right influencers, red baseball caps and escalating rhetoric.\n\nMr. Posobeic, a far-right media personality, delivered a speech about how the Department of Justice would be “coming for” enemies of the president. And he mused about setting up an immigrant detainment center in New Jersey similar to the one nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.\n\n“What should the New Jersey one be?” he asked. “How about the Boardwalk Brig? We’ll have them right here. You can throw tomatoes. It’ll be great.”\n\nBut Mr. Ciattarelli, who spoke earlier, didn’t change his stump speech much at all.\n\nTracey Tully and Mark Bonamo contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/world/americas/teotihuacan-writing-mystery.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:01:20-04:00","title":"New Crack at an Ancient Puzzle Reignites Debate for Archaeologists","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study by archaeologists Christophe Helmke and linguist Magnus Pharao Hansen from the University of Copenhagen proposes a novel method for deciphering the ancient writing system of Teotihuacan, a major Mesoamerican city that flourished from the 1st century B.C. to around 500 A.D.

The symbols have long confounded archaeologists, even as they have deciphered the writings of other cultures, leaving generations of scientists to debate puzzle pieces — signs and languages separated by hundreds of years — that never quite seemed to line up.\n\n“There was always this kind of sense that, ‘well, this looks like the best match,’ but the readings that were suggested always had some problems,” said Christophe Helmke, an archaeologist at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nNow, he and a linguist at his university, Magnus Pharao Hansen, have proposed a new way of looking at the puzzle. Rather than apply a language like Nahuatl — which the Aztecs spoke — they tried turning to a far older one, they reported in an article in Current Anthropology.\n\n“This is where our proposal comes in: We have a reconstruction of the language that’s contemporary with the writing system,” Mr. Helmke said.\n\nFounded around the first century B.C., Teotihuacan reached its zenith around 500 A.D., drawing people from around Mesoamerica to its monumental avenues. But the city was largely abandoned by 750 A.D., long before the Aztecs came to rule the area and set up their own capital nearby, where Mexico City now lies.\n\nSo Dr. Pharao Hansen set about the painstaking work of reconstructing an ancient language, Uto-Aztecan, through its not-so-ancient descendants, like Nahuatl, Cora and Huichol — tracing a family tree of words across huge periods of time.\n\nThis would not be the first time someone applied a reconstructed language to reading a text, but nobody had done it with this language before or with this script, he said.\n\n“And we have found a few fits — that’s the brilliant part,” Mr. Helmke said.\n\nThe researchers proposed interpretations for several symbols, with Dr. Helmke saying they have another 18 readings they “feel very, very good about.”\n\nThe scientists acknowledged, though, that they face the same daunting limitation that has frustrated researchers for decades. There are only about 300 known texts from Teotihuacan, a tiny figure compared with the thousands of documented Aztec or Maya texts that helped scholars learn those writing systems.\n\nSo while archaeologists not involved in the research were excited about the new approach,  it has also revived old debates and prompted hard questions from experts.\n\n“Each article on Teotihuacan writing IS a good step forward, because each attracts a generation of new linguists who bring their insights,” Joyce Marcus, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, said in an email. “The major problem has always been the tiny corpus of hieroglyphs from Teotihuacan; there are still so few examples of each hieroglyph.”\n\nIn some cases, the skepticism was intense, even as scholars expressed praise for the researchers.\n\n“I find that what they have come up with about Teotihuacan writing and language falls far short of being convincing,” said Lyle Campbell, a linguist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He said that the Teotihuacan symbols themselves “present major problems,” including the difficulty of interpreting what they depict, “speculation about both the form and meaning of signs,” and the infrequency of the signs.\n\nDavid Stuart, an archaeologist at the University of Texas at Austin, said: “This is an important contribution, but there are a lot of questions. Cristophe and Magnus have put together a very tight kind of constellation of clues here, but I think it’s a proposal that needs to be tested much further.”\n\nAdding to the complexity of the challenge, Dr. Stuart said, is that Teotihuacan was a cosmopolitan city with people from all over Mesoamerica, speaking their own languages.\n\n“Just the social fabric of that ancient community makes the question of language very messy, because there were no doubt many languages being spoken on the street if you walked around 500 A.D.,” he said.\n\n“There have been lots of possibilities out there,” he said. “As an archaeologist or historian of Mesoamerica it’s been really frustrating that it’s been this burning question. But I have a suspicion we’re going to be asking this question for a long time to come.”\n\nDr. Helmke and Dr. Pharao Hansen said they hoped that there might yet be more texts to be found on murals, ceramics or other artifacts in the old city.\n\n“Less than 5 percent of the whole site has been excavated,” Dr. Helmke said. “That’s after more than a century of intensive archaeological investigations, just because the site is so big.”\n\n“So,” Mr. Pharao Hansen said, “there’s a good possibility that others will be able to check whether our proposals hold water in the future.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/arts/television/stephen-colbert-trump-mri.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"02:12:56-04:00","title":"Stephen Colbert Spots Something in Trump’s ‘Perfect’ M.R.I.

Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.\n\nOn Air Force One this week, President Trump told reporters that he’d recently had an M.R.I. scan, and that the results were “perfect.”\n\n“Some of the best M.R.I. reports they’ve ever seen,” Stephen Colbert said on Wednesday. “In fact, we here at ‘The Late Show’ were able to acquire a copy of Trump’s M.R.I.”\n\n“Wait a second, what’s that in his stomach? It’s the Epstein files!” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n“Quick reminder: People don’t just ‘get’ an M.R.I. It’s usually something you only get when the doctors think something’s wrong with you. Scans are typically ordered for disease detection and monitoring, or to detect bone or joint abnormalities. Wait a second: bone abnormalities? If he aced it, that means his bone spurs are gone! Congratulations, Mr. President, you’re going to Vietnam!” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n“Well, guys, today, President Trump was in Tokyo, where he attended a meeting and ate lunch with the new prime minister of Japan. The prime minister said it was her first time seeing someone dip their sushi in ketchup.” — JIMMY FALLON\n\n“The prime minister gifted Trump a golf bag, a golden putter and told him that she had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump was like, ‘I think I found my soul mate.’” — JIMMY FALLON\n\n“Japan is trying to get on Trump’s good side to escape his, you know, his random tariff spree. So they gave him a couple gifts for America’s upcoming 250th birthday: some fireworks and 250 cherry trees, or, as it will be known in history books, ‘How Eric Trump started the D.C. wildfires.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n“Wow. OK, she is a great gift giver. A golf ball covered in gold? That is a combination of two of Trump’s favorite things. I mean, how could you even top that? Maybe an Epstein Island made of Lee Greenwoods?” — DESI LYDIC\n\n“The charm offensive seems to have worked, though. Trump praised the new Japanese prime minister as a winner, he said they’d become very close friends, and he told reporters he has caught more shrimp in his mouth at Benihana than any president in history.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\nThe singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus told Desi Lydic what makes a good love song on Tuesday’s “Daily Show.”\n\nSarah Paulson, the “All’s Fair” star, will appear on “The Late Show.”\n\nLily Allen’s “West End Girl” is a salacious autobiography of a pop album.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/world/europe/annabel-goldsmith-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:00:09Z","title":"Annabel Goldsmith, a Queen of British High Society, Dies at 91","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Annabel Goldsmith, a central figure in British high society, died at 91 in London.

inextricably linked with London’s nightlife through the ritzy club named after her, died on Oct. 18 at a hospital in London. She was 91.\n\nHer daughter Jemima Khan said on social media that Ms. Goldsmith died in her sleep.\n\nIn 1963, her first husband, Mark Birley, gave her name to his new nightclub — and Annabel’s, in the upscale Mayfair neighborhood, quickly became a place to see and be seen. The club, which was sold in 2007 as part of a deal valued at more than 90 million pounds (over $200 million today) and has since moved to a new location nearby, is still among the city’s most exclusive spots.\n\n“Although I have never particularly liked the name myself, Mark thought it was a good one for a club,” Ms. Goldsmith wrote in a 2004 memoir. “I look back on his decision with pride and consider it the most tremendous compliment he could ever have paid me.”\n\nMembers of the royal family have long frequented the club, as have celebrities like Frank Sinatra, Kate Moss and Harry Styles. Even Queen Elizabeth II walked through the doors once with Ms. Goldsmith, Billy Martin, a spokesman for the club, said. (It was reportedly the only time the queen ever visited a nightclub.)\n\nAnnabel’s opened when London was finally emerging from its postwar slump. The city “had started to dazzle with a new and magnetic color,” Ms. Goldsmith wrote in her memoir. And she seemed to be the embodiment of it.\n\nBut as often as she was seen at Annabel’s, she was not a natural night owl. “I have never been very good at late nights,” Ms. Goldsmith wrote. She nevertheless had the strong character, sense of humor and ability to throw memorable parties — as well as the noble lineage — to become “a high-society ‘it girl,’” as The Telegraph put it.\n\nAnnabel Vane‐Tempest‐Stewart was born on June 11, 1934, in London. She was the second child of Robin, Viscount Castlereagh, and Romaine (Combe) Vane-Tempest-Stewart. In 1949, her father became the eighth Marquess of Londonderry, giving the teenage Annabel the title of lady.\n\nShe attended Southover Manor, a boarding school for girls, and then Cuffy’s Tutorial College in Oxford. Both of her parents died when she was a young adult: her mother from mouth cancer; her father from the effects of alcoholism.\n\nAnnabel’s personal life was notoriously tangled, and made her a frequent presence in the British tabloids.\n\nIn 1954, when she was not yet 20, she married Mr. Birley, the son of a noted society portrait painter. She later wrote that the two grew apart “almost imperceptibly to ourselves.” Mr. Birley was all but consumed with running Annabel’s, while she spent much of her time raising their children.\n\nIt didn’t help that her husband was a serial adulterer, and she was unfaithful, too. In the mid-1960s, while still married to Mr. Birley, she began an affair with James Goldsmith, a flamboyant British-French financier. Mr. Goldsmith was also married at the time.\n\nShe and Mr. Goldsmith had three children, two of them born while she was still married to her first husband. She later wrote that she and Mr. Birley “discreetly divorced” after the birth of her son Zac Goldsmith.\n\n“Neither Jimmy nor I really wanted to get married again,” she wrote, but she and Mr. Goldsmith married to legitimize their children in 1978, by which time he had fallen in love with someone else. A few years later, he moved to the United States, while she and the children remained in Britain.\n\nIn 1994, Mr. Goldsmith founded a short-lived political party that campaigned for a referendum to be held on Britain’s relationship with the European Union. After he died in 1997, Ms. Goldsmith continued to support the cause on his behalf. In the 2001 general elections, she funded a campaign against pro-European candidates.\n\n“I feel I owe it to Jimmy to carry on where he was forced to leave off,” she told The Telegraph.\n\nIn 1970, her younger son from her first marriage, Robin, was severely injured when he was mauled by a tiger at a zoo. In 1986, her older son with Mr. Birley, Rupert, went missing while swimming off the coast of Africa and was presumed drowned.\n\n“It was worse than my parents dying,” Ms. Goldsmith told The Guardian. “But I said to myself: ‘I have six children. I’ve lost one. I have to be strong for the rest of them.’”\n\nThe interior designer Nicky Haslam, a longtime friend, said in an interview that while Ms. Goldsmith always had a certain gaiety, “you could tell there was an underlying line of tragedy that could not leave her.”\n\n“People all think about her as this sort of party girl,” he added, but she was more than that: “She had a wonderful memory for poetry and things like that, which she very rarely displayed.”\n\nAmong her confidantes was Diana, Princess of Wales, who spent many weekends toward the end of her life at Ms. Goldsmith’s home in the Richmond area of London.\n\n“I was aware that she came as much for the security and refuge that she found in the place as for the company of my family,” Ms. Goldsmith wrote. “I think she did regard me as something of a surrogate mother.”\n\nMs. Goldsmith is survived by two children from her first marriage, Robin and India Jane Birley; three children from her second marriage, Ms. Kahn, Zac Goldsmith and Ben Goldsmith; and 18 grandchildren.\n\nIn addition to her 2004 memoir, “Annabel: An Unconventional Life,” and another memoir, “No Invitation Required” (2009), Ms. Goldsmith wrote several other books, including “Copper: A Dog’s Life” (2006), about one of her many dogs, and “The Pelham Cottage Years” (2009), about her early years with Mr. Birley.\n\nUntil the end of her life, Ms. Goldsmith hosted an annual summer party. The writer Taki Theodoracopulos, a friend, said in an interview that those events always had an ideal mix of guests.\n\n“The better kind of journalists, aristos, writers, a lot of bad boys, a lot of naughty girls,” he said. “It was perfect.”\n\n"}]}
