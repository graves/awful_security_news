\n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:44 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the summer of 2024, a previously healthy 47-year-old father collapsed and died in the bathroom of his New Jersey home. An autopsy provided no answers. Everything looked normal, and his death was ruled sudden and unexplained.\n \n\n   \n  His widow reached out to a friend, a pediatrician. Would she read the autopsy report?\n \n\n   \n  The pediatrician, Dr. Erin McFeely, acted on a hunch and contacted Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia who had discovered almost two decades earlier that tick bites could cause people to develop an allergy to red meat.\n \n\n   \n  The allergy is unusual because the reaction doesn’t happen right away. People start to feel sick hours after they unwittingly eat beef, pork or lamb. Often, they’ll wake up in the middle of the night with symptoms that seem more like a bad bout of food poisoning or stomach flu than an allergy.\n \n\n   \n  Because so many people have potentially been sensitized to meat after tick bites but don’t know it, Platts-Mills and others have wondered whether there were unexplained deaths that were really severe reactions to a sugar found on mammalian cells, including those in red meat, called alpha-gal.\n \n\n   \n   The man’s case , which was detailed Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, turned out to be exactly what Platts-Mills had feared and is believed to be the first documented death linked to a red meat allergy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time I’ve heard a story that I thought we could sort out,” said Platts-Mills, who is part scientist and part Sherlock Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  “We need the serum” – the clear part of the patient’s blood – which was taken during his autopsy. He asked McFeely, “Can we get it?”\n \n\n   \n    Tick bites turn deadly\n \n\n   \n  The man’s story started with chigger bites, the case study says. But they weren’t chiggers; they were baby lone star ticks, about the size and color of a grain of sand.\n \n\n   \n  The man had been bitten by dozens of these tiny seed ticks on a camping trip with his family.\n \n\n   \n  “And this tick, the mothers, lay 5,000 eggs at a time, and the larvae will bite you,” Platts-Mills told CNN . \n \n\n   \n  In many parts of the eastern United States, the deer population has reached unsustainable numbers. Deer are the main hosts of the lone star tick, and as deer populations have grown, tick populations have exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “That combination of so many deer and so many mothers and the larvae biting means that vast numbers of people are sensitized, of whom a minority get food-related symptoms and then are at risk of severe events,” Platts-Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Alpha-gal allergy is a reportable diagnosis in only three states – Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia – so the actual number of cases in the US is not known. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  that as many as 450,000 Americans may have the allergy, but Platts-Mills estimates that as much as 5% of the population may be sensitized to red meat because of tick bites and not know it.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are not severe and can be managed by avoiding exposure to the sugar, which is found in food as well as in some pharmaceutical products. Symptoms range in severity from itchy hives or a rash to nausea and vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the lips or face, dizziness or fainting, and severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnose the condition by taking a careful history and controlled testing for a reaction to the sugar.\n \n\n   \n  Sometime after the camping trip, the case study says, the man’s family ate a late steak dinner. He woke at 2 a.m. with intense stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. He was in rough shape, but after two hours, his symptoms subsided.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, he told one of his sons, “I thought I was going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  His wife said they considered going to a doctor, but since the symptoms had eased, they didn’t know what they would say.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that a doctor’s visit would have helped. Too often, doctors don’t recognize alpha-gal allergy.  A 2023 CDC survey  found that 42% didn’t know what it was, and 35% said they lacked confidence to diagnose or manage it.\n \n\n   \n    An unrecognized allergy\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks later, in September 2024, the man and his wife went to a cookout, where he had a hamburger about 3 p.m. He drank a beer and came home and mowed the lawn. But by 7:20 p.m., he was vomiting again. His son called his mother and told her, “Dad is getting sick again.”\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the son found his father unconscious on the bathroom floor. He couldn’t be revived.\n \n\n   \n  Platts-Mills says that when he   was back in his lab, having gone through the necessary layers of permission to get the man’s postmortem blood samples, he cursed himself for not driving up to New Jersey to collect them himself.\n \n\n   \n  The delivery company lost track of them briefly, he said. He imagined them sitting for hours in the back of a hot truck, the valuable information they contained being baked away.\n \n\n   \n  They finally arrived in his lab in April, and he tested them for levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies, Y-shaped proteins primed to latch onto allergens like ragweed and pollen. The man had antibodies to both alpha-gal sugars and red meat.\n \n\n   \n  Next, Platts-Mills sent some of the blood to the Mayo Clinic lab, which tested it for an enzyme called tryptase that’s made by immune cells called mast cells. Tryptase breaks down proteins and is a marker of allergic reactions.\n \n\n   \n  The man’s tryptase levels were over 2,000 nanograms per milliliter, among the highest values ever recorded in cases of fatal allergic reactions called anaphylaxis.\n \n\n   \n  The man had died of eating red meat – the first known food allergy fatality linked to alpha-gal syndrome.\n \n\n   \n  Other people  have died of reactions to alpha-gal sugars , but those cases have involved sugars attached to a chemotherapy drug called cetuximab, which was how the syndrome was discovered in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “We gave them closure,” Platts-Mills said of the family in the case study.   “People make a big fuss about closure, but you don’t get it until you see it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/lamonica-mciver-charges-new-jersey-immigration-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Judge Denies Rep.

LaMonica McIver, who was  charged with assaulting federal agents  during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her  May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center  in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver  has pleaded not guilty  and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  The acting US attorney in New Jersey,  Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision is pending.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a  2019 appropriations bill  spelling out that authority.\n \n\n   \n  McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District.

brazen settler attacks against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs said settlers attacked the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit in the northern West Bank, calling it a “heinous crime and a blatant assault on the feelings of Muslims.”\n \n\n   \n  “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens’ properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The settlers attacked the mosque early Thursday before morning prayers, according to the Mayor of Deir Istiya.\n \n\n   \n  “Many houses and cars were not attacked, but rather the attack was on a religious symbol to provoke Muslims with offensive phrases against the Prophet [Muhammad] and Muslims,” Abdul Rahim Zidan said in an interview with state-run Palestine TV.\n \n\n   \n  Images shared by the ministry showed writing in Hebrew on the exterior of the mosque saying, “Mohammed is a pig,” a reference to Islam’s prophet, and “Not afraid of Avi Bluth.” Bluth is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander in the West Bank, who issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the settler attacks and calling the perpetrators an “anarchist fringe youth.”\n \n\n   \n  Images showed parts of the

The repeated attacks have marred this year’s olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. The video showed smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women wailing as men carry extinguishers and water buckets in a scramble to douse the fires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN visited the site of the attack and saw charred vehicles, and the damage left around the Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was just a message to scare us, to scare our employees… to try to enforce their reality on the ground… (but) we will continue operations, they can’t stop us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack.

\n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:18 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three Chinese astronauts will return to Earth on Friday, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.\n \n\n   \n  The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China’s Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they’d even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.\n \n\n   \n  But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-day wait, they are finally heading home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).\n \n\n   \n  The spaceship will return to the Dongfeng landing site in northern China’s Inner Mongolia region, according to state media. The three astronauts – Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie – are in good shape, and preparations for their landing are underway.\n \n\n   \n  The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China’s Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.\n \n\n   \n  Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a  nine-hour sortie , and it’s about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.\n \n\n   \n  The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.\n \n\n   \n  The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed  bans on Chinese citizens  with US visas participating in NASA programs.\n \n\n   \n  The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually  returned home  in March.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-yoon-drone-charges-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Phone notes that reveal an alleged plan to bait Kim Jong Un with drones","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korean prosecutors allege that former President Yoon Suk Yeol and senior defense officials planned to send drones into North Korea’s airspace to provoke a military response from Kim Jong Un, particularly targeting his personal residences and symbolic sites such as Samjiyon and Wonsan.

notes that reveal an alleged plan to bait Kim Jong Un with drones \n       \n  By Yoonjung Seo, Brad Lendon, Mike Valerio, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:40 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Secret drone flights from South Korea to the heart of Pyongyang were part of a ploy by the former president to rattle the North Korean leader, South Korean prosecutors have alleged as they released new details of plot they say preceded a foiled attempt to  declare martial law. \n \n\n   \n  Memos found on a senior defense official’s phone purportedly reveal plans by former president Yoon Suk Yeol and two other senior defense officials to aggravate Kim Jong Un enough to justify a shocking late-night military control order issued last December.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the evidence on Monday, appearing to confirm North Korea’s claims that South Korea sent covert drones to the country to drop anti-regime leaflets last October. The flights prompted a rare and fiery statement from Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s powerful sister.\n \n\n   \n  The North vowed to sever all road and rail connections to the South,  blowing up two roads  within its territory, but stopping short of military action. Weeks later, Yoon declared martial law, citing the need to protect the liberal South from “North Korean communist forces.”\n \n\n   \n  The snap decree was lifted within hours when South Korean lawmakers pushed past troops to vote it down, the first step in a reckoning for Yoon that’s still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n   A new indictment Monday  adds to Yoon’s mounting legal battles, which include a trial underway for alleged insurrection, and provides more pieces to a political puzzle that’s yet to be fully explained.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon denies he ordered drones to fly to Pyongyang to provoke North Korea and that he attempted to stage an insurrection through martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, called the indictment “a one-sided prosecution” that “fails to uphold even the basic tenets of legal logic, beyond being absurd.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the spokesperson and a prosecutor for the counsel, Park Ji-young, said prosecutors were “appalled” at what they had uncovered – and on Monday they released memos they say support their claim.\n \n\n   \n    Drones buzzing Kim’s home\n \n\n   \n  The allegations date back to last October, when North Korean state media reported that South Korean drones had  violated Pyongyang’s airspace  on multiple occasions, dropping anti‑regime leaflets.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released photos showing one drone lodged in a tree, described by analysts as resembling a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA also showed images of a drone it said was spotted flying low in the skies above the home of North’s Korean authoritarian supreme leader.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Byung-joo, a retired Korean Army four-star general now a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party, which sits in opposition to Yoon’s former party, told CNN in July that he had received details of the drone flights directly from whistleblowers of South Korea’s Drone Operations Command.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kim, the flights took place on at least three occasions, October 3, October 8-9, and November 13 of last year.\n \n\n   \n  “It is believed that by sending drones into the heart of North Korea and dropping leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un, the aim was to provoke a military response from the North,” the South Korean lawmaker told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like holding a knife to (North Korea’s) neck,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Kim Yo Jong issued her statement on October 12, condemning the airspace incursions and warning of “severe consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Kim Yong-hyun, then South Korea’s defense minister, initially denied sending drones to North Korea, but soon changed his response to say he “could not confirm” North Korea’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  After Yoon’s disastrous attempt to impose martial law, lawmakers from the now ruling Democratic Party demanded an inquiry into allegations the former president conspired to spark a national security crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Once in power, the lawmakers passed a bill to appoint an independent counsel, who released memos on Monday that they say reveal evidence of covert discussions about Yoon’s plans to provoke North Korea, a country with a long history of bombastic threats against South Korea and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  Among notes found on a phone belonging to the former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung were references to creating an “unstable situation,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Must find and exploit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that can produce short-term effects. To do that, we must create an unstable situation or seize an opportunity that has been created,” read one note drafted October 18 last year, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Another note read: “Targeting where (North Korea) loses face to such an extent that they feel they have no option but to respond.” Locations listed included the capital, two nuclear facilities, Kim’s vacation homes, as well as Samjiyon and Wonsan.\n \n\n   \n  Samjiyon is regarded as a sacred site in North Korea for being the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, and a symbolic location tied to his grandfather’s anti-Japanese resistance.\n \n\n   \n  The Wonsan-Kalma tourist area is one of Kim Jong Un’s flagship development projects, that has been hailed as a “great success” by the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Another memo from October 23 stated, “Goal and final status,” containing phrases such as “At minimum-national security crisis” and “At maximum-Noah’s flood,” in a possible reference to Noah’s Ark, where the only survivors of a biblical flood were those on board a mighty ship.\n \n\n   \n  A later note dated November 5 stated, “Enemy action must come first. There must be a wartime situation or a situation that cannot be controlled by police forces. Create the enemy’s conditions… we must wait for the decisive opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Park, the prosecutor’s spokesperson, said further details could not be disclosed due to laws concerning military secrets.\n \n\n   \n  However, she added that evidence from a notebook belonging to former Defense Intelligence Commander Noh Sang-won suggested that discussions and preparations for the martial law were believed to have begun no later than October 2023, after a major reshuffle of South Korea’s military generals.\n \n\n   \n  “The (alleged) act of the President, who holds supreme command over national security, and the defense minister, attempting to use inter-Korean military tensions to create conditions for declaring martial law, is absolutely unacceptable,” said Park.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmaker Kim Byung-joo, the retired general, said he was surprised the North Korean leader did not order a response after alleged South Korean drones were spotted over the capital.\n \n\n   \n  “In hindsight, it was a godsend luck for South Korea that North Korea refrained from any military provocation and stopped at rhetorical threats,” he said. “Had North Korea chosen to respond with military action under those circumstances, it could have escalated into a localized conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s deployment of more than 10,000 troops to Russia as combat soldiers in the war against Ukraine may have dissuaded Kim from acting further, said Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “North Korea could have found it difficult to maintain two war fronts, at the time. Because it would have meant causing a significant gap in combat capability.”\n \n\n   \n    A frustrated leader’s shocking act\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, and his former defense officials Kim and Yeo, all face charges of harming the interest of the state by helping the enemy and abusing their power. The three are already on trial on insurrection charges relating to the  martial law declaration. \n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military has yet to comment on the investigation or the indictment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.  CNN has reached out to lawyers for Kim and Yeo. According to local media, Yeo has said he deeply regrets not challenging Yoon’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, a firebrand conservative who has long taken a hardline on North Korea, narrowly won election in 2022, but his ruling party never had a majority in parliament, and struggled to get its legislative agenda passed. It was a source of constant frustration for his administration, and towards the end of last year, that frustration exploded in spectacular fashion.\n \n\n   \n  On December 3, Yoon declared martial law in a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within the opposition parties in the government that were sympathetic to North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopters and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television.\n \n\n   \n  Though assembly members pushed through the soldiers and voted to overturn the martial law decree, Yoon’s actions triggered mass protests, legal challenges, and ultimately, his removal through impeachment.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say sending drone flights into North Korea could have been interpreted as an act of war, provoking a military response that could have escalated into war.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Peninsula has been divided ever since a brutal war between the North and South ended with an armistice agreement in 1953. But the hostilities have never officially ended and relations between the two neighbors have been precarious ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said if Yoon had ordered the drone flights, it “would represent a dangerous interaction of domestic politics and security policy” in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  “While some national security activities are necessarily clandestine and operate in legal gray areas, robust checks, balances, and policy vetting should ensure they serve national interests rather than personal agendas,” Easley said.\n \n\n   \n  Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the potential international ramifications of the case are considerable, especially for the United States, a South Korean treaty ally with tens of thousands of troops at bases on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Drone flights into North Korea, he added, would violate the armistice agreement between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that the North Koreans violate the armistice all the time, but they’re not held politically accountable for it at home,” he said. “In a democracy like South Korea you can be held politically accountable for that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/science/hitler-dna-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:23:00-05:00","title":"Researchers Say They Have Verified and Sequenced Hitler’s DNA: A New Documentary Reveals the Findings","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new documentary titled 'Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator' reveals that researchers led by geneticist Turi King have sequenced DNA from a bloodstained fabric taken from Hitler’s bunker in 1945.

A new documentary reveals the findings \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:23 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Researchers have analyzed a sample of DNA believed to belong to Adolf Hitler, which they say reveals the dictator of Nazi Germany had a genetic marker for a rare disorder that can delay puberty, according to a new documentary.\n \n\n   \n  The research, which took more than four years to complete, was led by geneticist Turi King, a professor at the UK’s University of Bath who is known for identifying the  remains of King Richard III . King said she verified that a piece of material taken from a couch in the bunker where Hitler shot himself in 1945 was soaked in the dictator’s blood by comparing a DNA sample recovered from the blood with a confirmed relative of Hitler’s.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to suggesting the possibility that Hitler had a hormone-disrupting congenital condition called  Kallmann syndrome , the documentary examined rumors that the dictator had Jewish ancestry and looked at whether he had a genetic predisposition to certain mental health conditions. Called “Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,” the documentary premieres Saturday on Channel 4 in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  However, the findings shared in the documentary haven’t been reviewed by other scientists in the field or published in a scientific journal, making it hard for experts not involved in the project to evaluate the validity of its assertions. King said that the analysis had been submitted to a “high-profile” journal and said she hopes the work will be published soon.\n \n\n   \n  The small patch of frayed fabric started its journey in 1945 in the hands of US Army Col. Roswell P. Rosengren, who was communications officer for Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower. When Rosengren was allowed into Hitler’s bunker by Soviet forces, he cut a swatch of material from a bloodstained couch, according to the documentary. The swatch stayed in Rosengren’s family before being put up for sale at auction in 2014 and purchased by the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t know what we were going to find,” King said. “It could have been the most boring genome on the planet, but it has been incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The most striking finding from the team’s analysis was that Hitler had a mutation on a gene called PROK2. Variants in this gene  are a cause of Kallmann syndrome  and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, King  said. In boys, these conditions   can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, they are characterized by low testosterone levels. You either don’t go through puberty or you go through a partial puberty … 5% of cases get associated with a  micropenis , ”    King said, referring to a small but normally structured penis.\n \n\n   \n    Clues in the historical record\n \n\n   \n  At the time of his death, Hitler was observed at the end of the sofa with a gun and blood splattered on the couch and the wall behind him, said Nicholas F. Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. He examined parts of the sofa, which is now in Russia, in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  “If the provenance of the sofa material used is confirmed to have come from the Bunker and from the settee that Hitler and  Eva Braun  died on, then the likelihood of the blood having come from Hitler is very good,” Bellantoni said by email.\n \n\n   \n  The new details that King put forth appear to align with the historical record, according to Alex Kay, an expert on Nazi Germany and senior lecturer at the Chair of War Studies at Germany’s University of Potsdam. Kay also appeared in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that a medical document from Hitler’s stay in prison after a failed coup known as the Munich  beer hall putsch  in 1923 suggested the dictator had right-side cryptorchidism — a condition in which a testicle fails to descend into the scrotum.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of Kallmann syndrome is, for me, personally, as a historian and as somebody who has spent more than 20 years researching the Nazis, a major finding,” Kay said. He added the information potentially explained Hitler’s lack of personal relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Kay and King said the findings also put to rest lingering rumors that Hitler had Jewish ancestry — speculation that stemmed from Hitler’s grandmother becoming pregnant while working in a Jewish household, according to the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Because the Y chromosome data analyzed in the research matched the DNA of Hitler’s male line relative, King said it’s not possible Hitler had Jewish ancestry. “If that was the case, we wouldn’t have got the DNA match with him,” King said. “That DNA match not only confirmed that this is Hitler’s DNA but also confirms that that story of human Jewish ancestry through his father is just simply not true.”\n \n\n   \n    The value of historical DNA\n \n\n   \n  King said she had some initial reservations about taking part in the documentary but decided to participate because she felt her expertise would   ensure that the analysis was scientifically rigorous. “This is also not just a documentary but an academic paper,” she said, adding she had no publication date to offer.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have previously used DNA to study well-known historical figures. Beethoven’s DNA, recovered from a lock of hair, revealed that the  composer had health issues . Archaeologists also widely use ancient DNA from human remains.\n \n\n   \n  However, without information on the quality of the genome, the raw data or how the analyses were done, it is not possible to assess the assertions made in the documentary, according to Pontus Skoglund, senior group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n \n\n   \n  “Stepping back, the scientific value of a media campaign such as this balanced against the possible stigmatization of individuals with these real diseases today can also be questioned,” Skoglund said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the researchers could have shared the findings with the scientific community on what’s known as a preprint server before a formal peer review and publication in an established journal.\n \n\n   \n  It’s plausible that historical DNA could be extracted from the piece of cloth, but there has to be good justification for studying the DNA from historical figures and a defined set of questions, said Tom Booth, Skoglund’s colleague and a bioarchaeologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “There are extensive historical records documenting the behaviour of Hitler in public and private,” Booth said via email. “(H)e is probably one of the most intensively studied figures in history, so I think it’s difficult to argue the DNA evidence adds much in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  “Even the Kallmann syndrome diagnosis might not be as straightforward as the headlines suggest. There can be a lot of variation in how it manifests physically, and while it is a plausible explanation for his undescended testicle, it doesn’t justify the amount of ‘micropenis’ in my newsfeed.” \n \n\n   \n    A ‘small, small puzzle piece’\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also said they calculated a polygenic risk score, which involves sifting through a person’s DNA to quantify disease risk. Their findings suggested that Hitler had an increased genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.\n \n\n   \n  However, polygenic risk score is a tool used today for research purposes — it’s not diagnostic and doesn’t mean that Hitler necessarily had these conditions, said Ditte Demontis, a professor in psychiatric genetics at Denmark’s Aarhus University, who was involved in the research and appears in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  “Currently, we are at a state where polygenic risk scores for psychiatric conditions are only used in the context of research,” Demontis emphasized. “We can say something at a group level but not an individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Demontis compared Hitler’s polygenic risk score with those of 30,000 Danish people and found that if Hitler lived today “his score for schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder was actually higher than 99% of the individuals in the Danish population.” It is also rare to have a high polygenic risk score for all three conditions, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not diagnostic, and I also want to stress that the score absolutely by no means leads to any certain kinds of behavior or actions,” Demontis said.\n \n\n   \n  King agreed. “We are at great, great pain not to stigmatize people with these conditions, because, you know … it’s incredibly rare that   people with these conditions go on to commit violent acts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And the other thing is that Hitler did not act alone, he had hundreds and thousands of people who helped him,” King noted. “They’re not all going to have the same genetic makeup as him. His genetics is just a small, small puzzle piece.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-mvp-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00-05:00","title":"Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani unanimously voted MVP for fourth time; Yankees’ Aaron Judge named AL’s back-to-back winner","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers is named the National League’s Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in MLB history to win the MVP award in both leagues.

superstar  Shohei Ohtani  is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League’s Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league’s best player. New York Yankees right fielder  Aaron Judge  took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani, sitting next to his wife,  Mamiko Tanaka , and their dog,  Decoy , when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.\n \n\n   \n  The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported  $700 million  contract.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight  World Series  win.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a  magical postseason run  that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to  pitching  in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.\n \n\n   \n  The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a  historic season  last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all  30 votes  to win unanimously.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That’s first and foremost, it’s icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”\n \n\n   \n  He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB’s all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.\n \n\n   \n  Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.\n \n\n   \n  Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he’s won.\n \n\n   \n  “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today’s game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”\n \n\n   \n  Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher  Cal Raleigh  and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with  17  first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn’t beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”\n \n\n   \n  With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates’ 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year.

That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials are in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/eric-swalwell-mortgage-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00-05:00","title":"Bill Pulte refers Rep.

‘attack on freedoms’ after 18-day ordeal in US \n       \n  By Kara Fox, Sana Noor Haq, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:42 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A British journalist and political commentator  detained  by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained  Sami Hamdi , a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport. ICE stopped him the day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala, while he was en route to Florida to speak at a similar event.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza as “political retaliation.”   \n \n\n   \n  Hamdi recounted his 18 day ordeal to CNN shortly after his return to London.\n \n\n   \n  “When I entered San Francisco airport to fly to Florida, I went through security. As I looked for my gate, D38 to Tampa, a man walked up to me and said… ‘your visa was revoked two days ago, so now you are here illegally.’”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said the news came as a surprise, and he told the officials who had approached him that he had not been informed his visa was under review. He said he was then presented with a memo from the US State Department that said his visa had been revoked, without a reason as to why.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about any evidence that would show that Hamdi had overstayed his visa on Thursday, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told CNN that he wasn’t able to speak on specific cases but said: “We’re going to enforce our immigration laws…We’re revoking visas when appropriate, in line with our national security.”   \n \n\n   \n  At the airport, Hamdi said he asked officers for an explanation for the revocation, saying that if there wasn’t one, he would just “book my ticket to London and fly home.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the officers then told him: “‘That’s not the way this works here,’” before escorting him out of the terminal to a vehicle that was waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said he was told to get in the car, but initially refused, telling the officers: “With the greatest of respect, this looks like the movies. I’m not getting in any black car. I’m a British citizen. I have rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his appearances on British TV, his analyses on Middle East developments, for his support of the Palestinian cause – and his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After advocating for a phone call, Hamdi, said he briefly spoke with CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties organization, before he was taken to an ICE facility over four hours away.\n \n\n   \n  “They loaded me into a van with tight cuffs on my feet and on my hands, and they drove me four hours…and a half… I had to do a swap in the middle with a different car. And then they took me to the middle of nowhere,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.\n \n\n   \n  Despite never being charged with a crime, Hamdi said he was kept in shackles in for-profit facilities with little oversight.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality is that those those facilities are dehumanizing to the human beings (there), and when you look at the stories of the other inmates, it only breaks your heart,” he said, recounting multiple stories of fathers with green cards who had been detained without charge.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not that the courts won’t find them innocent, it’s that it seems there’s a concerted effort to make sure they do not go in front of a judge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi said shortly after he returned back to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi first came under fire after speaking at an event in London in 2023 following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. There, he told his audience not to pity Palestinians but rather to “celebrate the victory,”    in remarks from a speech that he told CNN were taken out of context.\n \n\n   \n  In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “My argument was that we have to solve the issue of the rights of the Palestinians. We have to solve the issue of occupation, apartheid, and that will bring peace to the region,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” he said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he added, alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights organizations have criticized the actions of the Trump administration, saying that they violate free speech protections, which apply to anyone who is legally in the US, regardless of citizenship status.\n \n\n   \n  Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  While Hamdi said he is mulling whether to sue US authorities, he also said he would rather take what he considers a win, and instead “celebrate” the decisions of the “cool heads” in the US State Department and federal court system.\n \n\n   \n  “I won this case, the extremists failed to silence my voice, they failed to remove my freedom of speech. America stood with me,” he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending time with his family and a game of soccer over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  While he said he is grateful for the global attention brought to his case, he also implied that he is keen to exit the limelight.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story is about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/media/bbc-apologizes-trump-documentary-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:46:00Z","title":"BBC apologizes to Trump over editing blunder, rejects defamation claim","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC apologized to former US President Donald Trump over an editing error in its documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?', which misrepresented his January 6, 2021 speech by showing him saying 'we fight like hell' in a context that did not appear in his actual remarks.

over a documentary that Trump’s lawyers described as false and defamatory, seeking to defuse a row that has plunged the public broadcaster into its worst crisis in years.\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson said that lawyers for the broadcaster had written to Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President (Donald) Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any BBC platforms while rejecting that it was defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Trump’s demands for compensation the broadcaster said, “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the October 2024 documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC had already apologized for an error of judgment in the documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, but not before it had ignited a scandal that saw the resignations of its director-general and head of news.\n \n\n   \n  In the documentary, Trump’s January 6 speech was edited to show him saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the US leader said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” with “fight like hell” coming 54 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Trump said the British broadcaster had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s board has been criticized for responding too slowly to the editing screwup, which was revealed in a leaked internal memo that has created a firestorm of criticism and allegations of systemic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Deborah Turness, the outgoing CEO of BBC News who resigned on Sunday, has said that while mistakes were made, “allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to BBC News staff following her resignation, Turness said that the backlash surrounding the Trump documentary had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  The British public broadcaster’s next steps are not immediately clear.

\n   \n  President Donald Trump was briefed this week on options for military operations inside Venezuela as he continues to mull a path forward in the country, four sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to decide on how to proceed, and he continues to weigh the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign. The president has previously voiced reservations about taking military action meant to oust Nicolas Maduro, concerned about whether it would prove effective.\n \n\n   \n  While Wednesday’s briefing included an updated set of options for the president to consider, it did not indicate that he’s closer to making a decision, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the briefing said the options were similar to those that have been discussed within the Pentagon, and some publicly reported, in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The target options – which United States Southern Command has stood up planning cells to develop – are part of an operation dubbed “SOUTHERN SPEAR,” according to a senior US official aware of the planning. They were presented by top officials on Trump’s national security team, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the operation on X Thursday night, though he did not reveal details.\n \n\n   \n  “Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Command had  previously announced  an operation called Operation Southern Spear in January. An announcement at the time said it would utilize “long-dwell robotic surface vessels, small robotic interceptor boats, and vertical take-off and landing robotic air vessels” to help with counternarcotics operations.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Southern Spear. The White House did not comment on the briefing.\n \n\n   \n   The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” arrived in the Caribbean this week amid a massive scale-up of US military resources.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including  air strikes  on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN had  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action at all. Administration officials told lawmakers last week that the US  didn’t have a legal justification  that would support attacks against any land targets – though it is possible they could generate one. And Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/jesse-jackson-hospitalized-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:04:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, has been hospitalized and is currently under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement, balance, and eye movements.

  \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson has been hospitalized, according to a statement obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, 84, a protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), the Rainbow PUSH Coalition said Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “He has been managing this neurodegenerative condition for more than a decade,” the organization said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “He was originally diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease ;  however, last April ,  his PSP condition was confirmed. The family appreciates all prayers at this time.”\n \n\n   \n   Further details about his condition have not been released. However, there has been “significant improvement” in the civil rights leader’s condition over the last 24 hours under medical care, his son Jesse Jackson Jr. said Thursday in a segment during his weekday radio show.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of the Jackson family, we cannot extend enough of our gratitude for those of you who have expressed your thoughts and prayers,” he said on his KBLA show, “The Jesse Jackson Jr. Show.”\n \n\n   \n  PSP is “a rare neurological disorder that affects body movements, walking and balance, and eye movements,” according to the  US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .\n \n\n   \n  The disease typically begins in a person’s 60s and has some symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, it adds. Most people with PSP develop severe disability within three to five years.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s son said he started receiving text messages from his mother towards the end of his radio show on Wednesday, sharing that his father “was not having a good day.” By the time he got to him, his father was already in the ambulance, with police and the fire department at the scene, Jackson Jr. said on his show.\n \n\n   \n  “I jumped out of my car and jumped into the ambulance and rode to the hospital,” Jackson Jr. said. “The doctors were able to work on him to get him the necessary fluids he needs to sustain him.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson rose to national prominence in the 1960s and has spent more than six decades advocating for racial equality, economic justice and voter rights.\n \n\n   \n  In 1971, he founded Operation PUSH as a way to improve Black communities’ economic conditions across the US.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson  later launched  the National Rainbow Coalition, in 1984, with the goal of obtaining equal rights for all Americans, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Some 12 years later, the two organizations merged to form Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  The organization’s origins stemmed from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s Operation Breadbasket, founded by King,  according to the website .\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s health drew public attention in 2017 when he spoke openly about his  diagnosis of Parkinson’s , an incurable disease characterized by tremors, stiffness and impaired movement.\n \n\n   \n  “My family and I began to notice changes about three years ago,” Jackson wrote in a statement at the time, calling the recognition of the symptoms “painful,” and noting Parkinson’s was the disease “that bested my father.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he took   the diagnosis as “a signal that I must make lifestyle changes and dedicate myself to physical therapy in hopes of slowing the disease’s progression.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Jackson faced several health challenges, including gallbladder surgery and Covid-19 hospitalization with his wife. Later that year, he suffered a fall and hit his head while attending a meeting at Howard University in Washington, DC, and was kept in the hospital overnight for observation.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2023, Jackson announced his retirement as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, succeeded by Rev.

McCoul’s firing came after political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Gov.  Greg Abbott .\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after McCoul’s termination, Texas A&M’s then president,  Mark A.

He did not offer a reason for stepping down but he and the school had faced political pressure and criticism, including from Abbott, after the video was posted on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Bright, president of the American Association of University Professors A&M chapter, said he believes McCoul’s case opened the door for the university system to put this policy in place.\n \n\n   \n  “Our job is to teach facts, teach the truth, and if … we have to use a litmus test of whether or not it meets someone’s approval, and it could be quite frankly their political approval, then we have no truth,” Bright, who is a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told the AP ahead of the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  During Thursday’s meeting, eight Texas A&M professors and instructors, including Bright, spoke against the policy, with many calling on regents to rehire McCoul.\n \n\n   \n  Two A&M professors spoke in favor of the policy, including Adam Kolasinski, with the Department of Finance, who said he didn’t believe the policy violated academic freedom and that “academic freedom does not mean you get to teach whatever you want.”\n \n\n   \n  Regent Sam Torn said the policy was being put in place to “make sure we are educating, not advocating.”\n \n\n   \n  A Texas law that forbids Texas K-12 schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity took effect on Sept. 1.

The transfer of Goldin’s remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.

CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon in the middle of a rally in Caracas on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  His exclusive remarks come amid heightened tensions with the US, which has  deployed warships  to the Caribbean to target what it claims are drug trafficking vessels from Venezuela. Though Washington insists the military buildup is aimed at disrupting the flow of narcotics to the United States, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro urged the US against entering another prolonged conflict, asking its people in Spanish: “To unite for the peace of (the Americas). No more endless wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan.”\n \n\n   \n   Asked if he had a message for US President Donald Trump, Maduro replied in English: “Yes peace, yes peace.”\n \n\n   \n  He did not directly answer whether he was concerned about possible aggression from the US. Instead, he simply replied that he was focused on governing his country with peace.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro was attending a mass rally for Venezuela’s youth, whom he later urged to resist what he described as a threat of invasion from the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past three months, the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the Caribbean alongside more than a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform.”\n \n\n   \n  The build-up, considered the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989, has raised speculation that the US may be preparing for a larger conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US says it has carried out at least  20 strikes  against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing 80 people.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that the Trump administration is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside the South American nation. But the administration has also told Congress in recent days that the US did not have a legal justification that would support strikes within Venezuela, though CNN has reported that officials are considering what such a legal opinion would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela has responded by launching a massive  mobilization  of military personnel as well as militia forces made up of civilians. The units have been carrying out exercises across the country to prepare for any potential threat from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The country also appears to have installed large objects on a key highway that are commonly used to block military vehicles such as tanks. A satellite image captured by Vantor on November 10 shows “hedgehog” anti-vehicle obstacles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, which is the main route into the city from the coast. The obstacles first appeared there over a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, has some 123,000 members. Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/media/bbc-trump-panorama-legal-threat-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00Z","title":"BBC Signals It Will Fight, Not Fold Under Trump’s Political Pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC has refused to settle a defamation lawsuit from President Donald Trump’s legal team, instead affirming it will fight to defend its journalistic independence.

PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least half a dozen major media companies have stared down legal threats from President Trump this year. Some have chosen to fight, others have opted to fold. The BBC is signaling that it will fight.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the British national broadcaster responded to a  demand letter  from Trump’s lawyers by  apologizing for an editing error  but arguing that the president doesn’t have a serious case.\n \n\n   \n  The public response indicated that if Trump goes ahead and sues, the BBC will vigorously defend itself, rather than immediately seek to settle the matter out of court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a pivotal moment in the ongoing tug-of-war between Trump and the news outlets that strive to report on him independently and confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is a fight about stopping Trump from deploying his pattern of intimidation, bluster and threats against an organization that plays a huge role in setting the global media agenda,” Joel Simon, the founding director of the Journalism Protection Initiative, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Simon, who has been  chronicling  the BBC’s efforts to expand in the US, said the dustup is also “about the ability of the British public to determine what kind of media it wants, and what kind of BBC, without Trump mucking it up.”\n \n\n   \n  In the US this year, Trump has proven adept at applying political and legal pressure to media owners — and has squeezed settlement payments and other concessions out of some, but not all, of them.\n \n\n   \n  Media critics and consumers have worried that Trump’s attempts at intimidation and dominance have caused journalists to soften and self-censor aggressive reporting.\n \n\n   \n  But some newsroom leaders and media moguls have recognized that Trump’s tests are an opportunity to reaffirm their independence.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC seems to be doing that.\n \n\n   \n  As outgoing BBC director general Tim Davie said the other day, “We have to fight for our journalism.”\n \n\n   \n    No payout, no retreat\n \n\n   \n  Let’s be clear about what happened: Someone at the BBC’s “Panorama” newsmagazine program screwed up by stitching together two different clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech hours ahead of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  No one seemed to notice the error when the documentary first aired in October 2024. But when the editing error was publicized last week, the BBC was too slow to address the controversy, giving Trump even more of an opening to target the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness  resigned on Sunday , citing the need for leaders to take responsibility, even though the mistake was made much further down the editorial chain.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, BBC chair Samir Shah acknowledged an “error in judgment” with the clip. By then, Florida-based lawyers for Trump had sent the BBC a letter claiming the documentary caused Trump “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and warning of a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts scoffed at the letter, saying Trump’s chances of winning such a lawsuit were low.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has pursued other legal claims in the past despite a similarly low likelihood of success. And some institutions have folded under the pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Disney , the parent of ABC, and  Paramount , the parent of CBS, decided to strike settlement deals with Trump rather than risk court battles. Both media companies made payments toward Trump’s future presidential library, triggering widespread outrage.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as the BBC said it received a legal threat from Trump, speculation arose about a similar payout by the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  But there has been no such settlement or secret side deal, a senior BBC source told CNN. And if such a payout were ever to occur, it would be publicly disclosed. The BBC, after all, is primarily funded through license fees paid by British taxpayers.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s own news coverage of Thursday’s legal reply to Trump emphasized that the broadcaster had “rejected his demands for compensation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s lawyers had given the BBC a Friday deadline to respond. The president had no immediate reaction to the broadcaster’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    The pros and cons of standing tall\n \n\n   \n  News outlets that have stood up to Trump this year have garnered praise from readers. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, for instance, are both fighting suits that were filed on Trump’s behalf by the same Florida law firm.\n \n\n   \n  The suit against The Times was initially  thrown out  by a judge in September for being “decidedly improper and impermissible.”\n \n\n   \n  When the lawyers refiled a shorter version, The Times was forceful in its response. “As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: This lawsuit has no merit,” a newspaper spokesperson said. “This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate P.R. attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n \n\n   \n  Media executives have pointed out, however, that court battles can be costly and unpredictable.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials may find themselves hoping that Trump gets distracted and moves on to a new target.\n \n\n   \n  When Disney briefly suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration in September, the consumer backlash was swift, including in the form of Disney+ subscriber cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  And when Disney brought Kimmel back on the air — showing a willingness to fight after briefly deciding to fold — Trump made one more blustery threat against ABC. But then he evidently moved on; the government hasn’t taken any known action against the network, and the president hasn’t brought up Kimmel in nearly two months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-clase-ortiz-plead-not-guilty-gambling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:16:00Z","title":"Cleveland Pitcher Emmanuel Clase Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges Alleging He Rigged Pitches for Gamblers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase pleaded not guilty to federal charges alleging he bribed gamblers in the Dominican Republic to rig pitches, including throwing balls outside the strike zone and making specific pitch speed predictions.

Both are due back in court Dec. 2.\n \n\n   \n  The two pitchers have been on  non-disciplinary paid  leave since July, when MLB began investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched.\n \n\n   \n  According to prosecutors, the two accepted thousands of dollars in bribes to help two unnamed gamblers in their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on bets placed on the speed and outcome of their pitches.\n \n\n   \n  They allege that Clase, who is on the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract, began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023, but didn’t ask for payoffs until earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say Clase often threw the rigged pitches on the first pitch of an at-bat, making sure to throw the ball in the dirt and well outside the strike zone in order to assure the umpire called it a ball rather than a strike.\n \n\n   \n  During an April game against the Boston Red Sox, Clase even spoke to one of the betters by phone just before taking the mound, prosecutors contend. Minutes later, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph).\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say Clase recruited Ortiz to join the scheme earlier this year and sometimes provided money to the gamblers to fund the bets.\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s lawyer, Michael Ferrara, noted in court Thursday that the Guardians’ all-time saves leader voluntarily returned to the US to answer to the charges rather than make prosecutors seek extradition.\n \n\n   \n  “His actions speak louder than words. He poses no risk of flight,” Ferrara said as the judge weighed the conditions of Clase’s release. “He intends to stay through this.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Ferrara said Clase maintains his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,” he said in a Wednesday statement.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Georgalis, a lawyer for Ortiz, has also denied the charges, saying payments between his client and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for legal activities.\n \n\n   \n  Clase and Ortiz are each charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Following the pitchers’ indictments, Major League Baseball announced new limits on betting on individual pitches.\n \n\n   \n  The charges against Clase and Ortiz are the latest gambling scandals to roil American professional sports following the landmark 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that legalized sports betting in most states.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, more than 30 people, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, were  arrested in a gambling sweep  that involved leaked inside information about NBA athletes and rigged poker games backed by Mafia families.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-files-house-vote-johnson","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-05:00","title":"Johnson shifts strategy on Epstein files vote – as GOP leaders brace for mass defections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has shifted strategy to expedite a House vote on a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, aiming to force the Justice Department to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files.

Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — as supporters push for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  Republican sources say there’s a broad cross-section of the conference willing to support the plan — and it will be hard to limit defections.\n \n\n   \n  “No point in waiting,” one House GOP leadership source familiar with the strategy shift told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A House GOP lawmaker said of the speaker’s decision: “If you got to do it, might as well do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie told CNN on Wednesday that his hope is that a veto-proof majority will pressure the Senate to act over Trump’s opposition. It would require two-thirds of the House — or 290 votes if all members are present — for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get less than two-thirds vote when it comes up for a vote, I think it’s an uphill battle,” Massie said. “But if we are somehow able to get two thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president.”\n \n\n   \n  A Senior White House official told CNN that Trump was made aware ahead of time that Johnson was going to expedite the vote, and that the two had spoken about it.\n \n\n   \n  “It was made clear to President Trump, and he understands that this is an inevitable reality,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson sent the House of Representatives home for its August recess early – in part to avoid a  vote  related to the Epstein files. When the House returned in September, top congressional Republicans and White House allies were working  behind the scenes  to prevent the politically charged vote. And there was even a last-ditch effort by the president and his allies on Wednesday  to engage with  two of the Republican women helping the effort move forward before it was too late.\n \n\n   \n  But now, GOP sources told CNN, part of the calculation is that the momentum in the House is unstoppable and the only course of action is to send it over to the Senate to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it out of the House,” another GOP lawmaker in support of the strategy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, Massie and Khanna were expecting it to be weeks before their bill would get a vote on the House floor.\n \n\n   \n  Even after the bipartisan duo secured the 218 signatures needed to move forward on Wednesday, there was still a procedural process that had to play out because the effort did not have the blessing of House Republican leadership to come to the floor sooner.\n \n\n   \n  So when Johnson said Wednesday that he was going to expedite the process and put the bill on the floor next week, many were surprised.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson  said  on Wednesday, adding, “In the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given the ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the panel on Wednesday and top Trump administration officials  met with  GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of the few Republicans who signed onto the effort demanding DOJ release its trove of Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t block the parade, you might as well get ahead of it,” Khanna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  If Massie and Khanna’s bill clears the House, as is now expected, it’s fate in the Senate remains uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/fetterman-hospitalized-fall","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00Z","title":"Pennsylvania Sen.

 By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:56 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department is  suing California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/canada-ontario-bus-joyride-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:52:00-05:00","title":"Man takes bus for joyride in Canada, turns down passenger with expired pass","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, took over a transit bus after the real driver took a break and drove it for a joyride, during which he denied entry to a passenger with an expired bus pass.

Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to a court ruling, dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Of those arrested, 615 are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Cummings stated he would allow their release on a $1,500 bond and enrollment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Alternatives to Detention program, which can include electronic monitoring, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered the government to identify the people who are eligible for release by noon Friday and paused deportation proceedings for them until the next business day after their release.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the immediate release of 13 people who were arrested in violation of a consent decree that limits warrantless arrests, specifying they are to be released on their own recognizance without bond or conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The judge further ordered the government to produce by November 19 the names and threat levels of the approximately 3,000 people arrested since June.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented people – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  Challenges remain for those ordered to be released, immigration experts said in response to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested people have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week, finding her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his Customs and Border Protection agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  That news came days after Bovino was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/travel/worlds-best-cheese-2025-gruyere-switzerland","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:04:00Z","title":"Three cheeses on, we could still taste it: Swiss Gruyère crowned the world’s best cheese","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Swiss Gruyère from Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen won the 2025 World Cheese Awards, a global competition featuring 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries evaluated by 265 international judges in Bern, Switzerland.

Gruyère crowned the world’s best cheese \n       \n  By Barry Neild, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:04 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Remember that time you had too much   cheese, felt a bit queasy and — as a greasy sheen broke out on your forehead — you lied to yourself that it was salad from now on?\n \n\n   \n  Then spare a thought for the heroic judges at this year’s World Cheese Awards, who assembled on Thursday to anoint an aged Swiss Gruyère as the best cheese in the world for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This army of 265 cheese experts from all over the planet was tasked with wading through dairy concoctions of every shape, size, color and consistency in a large auditorium in the Swiss capital Bern. In the space of a couple of hours, each judge plowed their way through at least 40 cheeses — sniffing, stroking, crumbling, and finally, tasting to arrive at a score.\n \n\n   \n  The winner was Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen, a cheese made from cow’s milk at a small dairy in the Alpine lowlands of western Switzerland. “It’s an incredible honor,” said cheesemaker Pius Hitz, shortly after picking up the top prize.\n \n\n   \n  While the win in previous years has resulted in a surge in sales for the champion cheese, Hitz said his herd of red and white Fleckvieh   cows can rest easy. A production increase is unlikely, he said, so as not to disturb the delicate balance of the protected Gruyère market.\n \n\n   \n  Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen may have only traveled a few miles to the awards, but it was still a long journey to the top. More so for its rivals, many of which had to navigate long plane rides, tricky import legislation and the US shutdown even before the contest started.\n \n\n   \n  No fewer than 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries made it to Bern’s Festhalle venue where, as judgment day wore on, they made their presence known with cascades of intensifying odors that collided with sound waves from an ensemble of Swiss horns tooting in the corner of the auditorium.\n \n\n   \n    Soft pools of goo\n \n\n   \n  The cheeses were divided up across 110 rows of white-clothed tables under the scrutiny of two- or three-person judging teams. All wearing matching yellow aprons, they were drawn from the community of makers, mongers and mavens who make up the ranks of the international cheese cognoscenti.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 10 a.m., they began the Herculean labor of trying to find bronze, silver, gold and “super gold” contenders among the milk-based marvels — stripped of identifying features so they can be blind tasted — stretching before them.\n \n\n   \n  Holes were bored in giant waxy wheels, slivers shaved from wedges, spoons dipped into soft pools of goo. In between tastings, palates were cleansed with sips of water, bites of crunchy apples and, in some cases, emergency swigs of Coca-Cola.\n \n\n   \n  There were cow, sheep, buffalo, camel and donkey milk   cheeses. Manchegos, Bries, Camemberts, cheddars, Parmesans, Goudas. Orange cheeses, blue cheeses, green cheeses. Cheeses covered in wax. Cheeses covered in flowers. At least one cheese doused in whiskey and red apple juice.\n \n\n   \n  Some were hard. Some crumbly. Some dense. Some were light and fluffy. Some were so soft they needed to be in jars. Some, their tops cut off to reveal a moist interior glistening with mold, looked as if they might teem with lifeforms as yet unknown to science.\n \n\n   \n  All were awarded points based on appearance, smell, taste, texture and the feeling it gives in the mouth — not always a pleasant experience, apparently.\n \n\n   \n  “There were a couple of no-swallows today,” said Emma Young, a UK cheesemonger and author judging the wares laid out on table 26, pointing out a cheese that she thought might have encountered problems during the making process.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t all bad.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s bonkers,” Young added. “I’ve tasted some of the best cheeses I’ve had in my life — and some of the worst. It’s been so much of a palate workout.” She pointed to a cheese that earned top marks thanks to a “complexity” she put down to the varieties of milk used.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Biting into a cloud’\n \n\n   \n  “If only it tasted as beautiful as it looks,” said Ashley Morton, a judge on table 11, where an unusually bright blue cheese, made using spirulina algae, was attracting camera phones. Morton, a “cheese ambassador” originally from New York who goes by the nickname Brieyoncé, favored a raw goat cheese coated in a gray substance that was “almost like biting into a cloud.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look at the fruit level here,” said Jen Shelton, an organic milk expert originally from Kansas, discussing a large wheel of cheese covered in pressed grapes with fellow table-52 judge Charles Beauquesne, from France. The cheese then scattered onto the table. “It’s very crumbly,” she added. “Milky, but quite dry. The grapes give it a little bit of sweetness, but it’s claggy.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair made a note of the cheese’s score, wiped down their utensils with a paper towel   and moved on to the next candidate.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, many of the judges had made their final selection, carrying “super gold” winners to a separate judging area where a team of seasoned cheese experts pared the field down to 14 finalists. These were then tasted and scored live on stage, like an aromatic “Dancing with the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  The shortlist included a Japanese soft goat’s cheese with a texture like whipped cream, a UK hard cheese the color of a deep sunset, one US cheese and, inevitably, several more Swiss cheeses. It’s widely recognized that entries from the host country have a home advantage — cheeses are not great travelers — but locals don’t always take the crown. A Gruyère won in 2022 when the contest was staged in Wales.\n \n\n   \n  John Farrand, managing director of the event’s organizers, the UK-based Guild of Fine Food, said the World Cheese Awards stand out above other dairy contests around the planet because it can claim to be truly global — staged in different countries and involving such a diverse cast of entrants and judges. In 2026, the contest will move to Córdoba in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  The winning cheese of 2025 was championed by Perry Wakeman, one of the top-level judges who normally is found aging cheese at Rennet & Rind, near Cambridge, England. The Gruyère was a worthy winner, he said, describing its complexity: “Butterscotch, caramel. Savory, some fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal. The length was unbelievable. Three cheeses on, we could still taste it.”\n \n\n   \n  For onlookers, the cheese judging could be a frustrating process. Concerns over foot and mouth disease and other agricultural health problems meant that only judges who’d signed a waiver were permitted to sample the produce under the terms of the contest’s special import license.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the day, the auditorium tables were still groaning with leftover cheese that would sadly never be eaten. The contest organizers said that the remnants don’t completely go to waste, but would be recycled locally and “turned into energy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/california-trump-redistricting-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:38:00Z","title":"Trump Administration Sues to Stop California from Redistricting to Give Democrats More House Seats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has sued to block California’s redistricting effort, which was approved by 64% of voters via Proposition 50.

redistricting to give Democrats more House seats \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration moved Thursday to challenge California’s effort to redraw the state’s  congressional maps  ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, throwing the full weight of the Justice Department in the high-stakes battle over control the House of Representatives next year.\n \n\n   \n  After voters in the Golden State approved a ballot measure last week that allows state Democratic lawmakers to replace congressional lines drawn by the state’s independent commission  with new ones  that make five Republican-held US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the California Republican Party and others raced to court to block the redistricting effort.\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s move to join that lawsuit is a dramatic escalation in the legal challenge, which, if successful, could scramble Democrats’ plan to push back against a nationwide effort by Republicans, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to boost the party’s chance of holding on to their House majority through rare, mid-decade redistricting ploys across several states.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the Trump administration told the federal judge overseeing the case in the Central District of California on Thursday that days after the case was brought last week, the “federal interest” in the matter became clear given the constitutional issues and claims of race-based discrimination at stake in the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that the redistricting plan was sold to voters as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  “Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,” the Justice Department lawyers  wrote in court papers . “Because the Proposition 50 map does, the United States respectfully requests that this court enjoin defendants from using it in the 2026 election and future elections.”\n \n\n   \n  “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,” said Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, cast California’s plan as a “brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process.”\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    64% of voters backed Newsom plan\n \n\n   \n  Democrats argued the measure, Proposition 50, was necessary to counter Texas’ new congressional map, which Republicans redrew in a bid to gain five seats at Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  While Texas Republicans were able to draw new lines with legislation, California Democrats needed voters to pass a constitutional amendment to temporarily override the state’s non-partisan independent redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  Over  64% of voters  approved the plan.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats significantly outraised and outspent Republicans in the state. Newsom became the face of the measure, arguing that Democrats needed to “fight fire with fire” to prevent the president from skewing the 2026 midterm election map. Other key surrogates, including former President Barack Obama, joined the effort, which Democrats see as key to their chances of retaking the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not usual for the federal government to get involved in election-related cases. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department had its hands in litigation over state efforts to purge voter rolls and certain restrictive voting measures enacted in GOP-led states.\n \n\n   \n  The California case hasn’t developed much since it was brought last week. Newsom and the other stare officials named as defendants have yet to file responses to the allegations and the judge randomly assigned to the case has not scheduled any major court hearings. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been allowed to join the case to defend the redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n    Trump has backed pro-GOP efforts\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s decision to  join the California lawsuit  is noteworthy given Trump’s call for Republicans state lawmakers to redraw their maps ahead of next fall’s elections to help the very thin GOP majority in the House.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department’s involvement in the California effort is not the first time this year that it has inserted itself into the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  In July, as attention was turning to Texas’ congressional maps, a top DOJ official sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton that raised “serious concerns” about the “legality” of four districts in the state.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ official, Harmeet Dhillon, urged the state to “rectify” the issues or risk legal action from the department. The following month, several of the districts flagged by Dhillon were impacted by the state’s redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00Z","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a 43-day federal government shutdown—the longest in history—President Donald Trump signed a compromise bill that ended the impasse.

Trump on Wednesday night  signed  the compromise bill that ended the 43-day shutdown soon after the legislation  passed the House .\n \n\n   \n  The  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the bill extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the package, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions will continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The package fully funds the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance.

Brooke Rollins  told CNN  that all recipients should see their full funding by Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also replenishes SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund will also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one, though they should receive their  back pay  in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Rep.

Ford aircraft carrier , has raised speculation that both the United States and Venezuela may be  preparing for a larger conflict. \n \n\n   \n  While the US has characterized the buildup as aimed at combating drug trafficking, some experts have questioned why so much firepower is needed if the sole aim is targeting drug boats. They note that the ship’s arrival marks the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself – described as the US Navy’s “ most lethal combat platform ” – the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the region alongside more than a dozen warships – including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship and amphibious assault vessels – and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  That sort of firepower brings into sharp relief what experts characterize as the aging Soviet-era equipment Venezuela would be relying on if US President Donald Trump  were to decide  on military action inside the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the forces at Caracas’ disposal:\n \n\n   \n    A tough, but aging, Soviet image\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), has built a reputation over the past two decades as a regional military power a cut above most of its neighbors in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that image was forged through the sustained acquisition of Russian equipment under Maduro’s predecessor, the late President Hugo Chávez, a former professional soldier who owed his ascent to power to the revolutionary movement he founded within the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  After Chávez became president in 1999 (seven years after he organized a failed military coup), he funneled the country’s massive oil resources into the military, buying Russian equipment due to an informal US embargo and placing military men in key government positions.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, weapons systems such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 battle tanks, S-300, Pechora and Buk anti-aircraft missiles, portable Igla-S systems and Kalashnikov rifles – all designed in Soviet times, have come to define the FANB’s image. The arsenal distinguishes the Venezuelan forces from other militaries in the region, which tend to rely more heavily on US or European weaponry (though Venezuela still has some aging US-designed equipment from pre-Chávez days).\n \n\n   \n    A paper tiger?\n \n\n   \n  The problem for Venezuela is that while on paper it has a relatively well-equipped military, question marks hang over the maintenance of its equipment and the training of its personnel – not least because the country has suffered more than a decade of economic hardship, one of the world’s  highest rates of inflation  and a drop in oil production, all made worse by US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Partly due to this economic collapse, about 7.9 million Venezuelans – many of them young people of military service age – have left the country, according to UN data.\n \n\n   \n  Though the government “recently resumed modest maintenance and modernization efforts,” according to a 2024 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), years of underinvestment have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  “The FANB has a rather low level of operational capability and asset availability, partly because they’ve been through more than a decade of economic crisis in the country,” Andrei Serbin Pont, an analyst specializing in defense at the CRIES think tank, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Military and militia: In numbers\n \n\n   \n  Currently, the FANB has about 123,000 active personnel. The army  has 63,000, the navy 25,500, the air force 11,500 and the national guard 23,000, according to the IISS. These are supplemented by about 8,000 reservists.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to its regular military units, Venezuela can call on the Bolivarian Militia – a reserve force made up of civilians. It was created by Chávez and named after Simon Bolívar, the revolutionary who secured the independence of numerous Latin American countries from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  However, the true size of the militia is opaque. Prior to the recent US buildup, the IISS estimated its number at 220,000, but in August Maduro claimed he would deploy 4.5 million militiamen in response. Weeks later, he said he expected to call up a total of 8.2 million – though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of their training.\n \n\n   \n    Army: Loyal, but top heavy?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower:  With its 63,000 members, Venezuela’s ground forces account for the greatest chunk of its active personnel. They also have the longest history and are most politically aligned with the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Chávez, both the current interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, passed through the army – and Padrino is still an active four-star general.\n \n\n   \n  One indicator of how entwined the government and army have become is the unusual number of generals and admirals, with promotions being doled out for political loyalty. In 2019, that number was estimated at about 2,000 by Adm. Craig Faller, then chief of the US Southern Command, in a speech to the US Congress. “More than in all of NATO,” he pointed out. (In comparison, in 2025, the US had  about 850  for an armed forces 10 times larger).\n \n\n   \n  “Ecuador is a convent, Colombia is a university, and Venezuela is a barracks,” goes an old saying, attributed to Bolívar, that sums up the relationship of Venezuelans with the army.\n \n\n   \n   Weaponry:  Notable systems bought from Russia in recent years include 92 T-72B1 tanks – similar to those being used in Ukraine – and 123 BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, which equip the armored brigades alongside 81 AMX-30 tanks previously acquired from France, according to the IISS. Artillery systems include the Russian Msta-S self-propelled howitzer and Smerch rocket launchers.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿Led by:  The operational strategic commander of all of Venezuela’s armed forces is Domingo Antonio Hernández Lárez. His brother, Maj. Gen. Johan Alexander Hernández Lárez, is in charge of the army.\n \n\n   \n    Air Force: High standard\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  With 11,500 members, the Bolivarian Military Aviation, or air force, is the smallest of the country’s forces but takes pride of place due to the acquisition of Russian equipment that has set it apart among regional competitors in the Caribbean and most of Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  At the center of this arsenal are Sukhoi Su-30MK2s, high-performance twin-engine fighters that, even though developed in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, are unmatched in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-September, the FANB  shared videos  of two of its Su-30s armed with Kh-31 anti-ship missiles, also Russian-made, in a show of what remains its most advanced weapons system.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is thought to have had 24 of these planes at one point, but at least three have crashed, according to the IISS. The Venezuelan NGO Control Ciudadano says the accidents highlight “problems of system obsolescence and of maintenance and lack of spare parts.”\n \n\n   \n  The Su-30s coexist with a few old US F-16 fighters that Venezuela bought before Chávez came to power.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela also has Russian-built air defenses that include 12 batteries of long-range S-300 missiles; nine Buk systems and 44 Pechora units, both medium-range; and numerous portable Igla-S launchers, according to the IISS.\n \n\n   \n  These defenses, while advanced, would likely be the first targets of an opponent if a conflict were to break out, said Serbin Pont, the CRIES analyst.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Maj. Gen. Lenín Lorenzo Ramírez Villasmil.\n \n\n   \n    Navy: Weak point?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  The Bolivarian Navy, whose 25,500 members are tasked primarily with operations in the Caribbean, has lagged the other services in terms of arms purchases in recent decades.\n \n\n   \n  It currently operates only one Mariscal Sucre-class frigate (manufactured in Italy) and one Type-209 submarine (manufactured in Germany) in its sea fleet, according to the IISS. It also has nine oceanic and coastal patrol vessels, including four purchased from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  “The navy lost many of its assets that it had prior to (Chavez), and these were not fully replaced. The corvettes bought from Spain were never equipped with weaponry, until a few years ago when Chilean and Iranian anti-ship missiles were installed, but they do not have viable anti-aircraft defense systems,” said Serbin Pont.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Adm. Ashraf Suleimán Gutiérrez.\n \n\n   \n    And the militias?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Maduro has repeatedly played up the role of the Bolivarian Militia, formed in 2008 by Chavez to provide a loyal paramilitary force that, while technically part of the armed forces, comes directly under the control of the president.\n \n\n   \n  A definitive account of how many people belong to the Bolivarian Militia, an umbrella term for various groups that range widely in experience and ability, is hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  Days after news of the US naval deployment broke, Maduro said in August he was going to “activate … more than 4.5 million militiamen” taken from “all the factories and workplaces of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Missiles and rifles for the working class, so that they may defend our homeland,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He later suggested that the militia has more than 8 million members.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the discrepancies in number, Serbin Pont said that while there were some traditional militias composed of reservists with military experience, most of the groups showcased by the government on television and social media were too inexperienced to play a decisive fighting role.\n \n\n   \n  “Those people do not have sufficient training. There is no real armed structure to mobilize those elements, and those elements would not be effective in combat,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Their real use, Serbin Pont suggested, was serving “as an intelligence network and a repressive threat against the civilian population precisely because they are based on a network that penetrates the whole of society.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/alina-habba-office-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00-05:00","title":"Person ransacks New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office after being denied meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A person attacked and ransacked the New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office building after being denied a meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba.

handpicked prosecutor Lindsey Halligan \n       \n  By Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn  Polantz, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:55 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James battled the Justice Department in court Thursday over whether President Donald Trump lawfully appointed a prosecutor to go after his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  The two cases suffer from “a fundamental defect,” Comey’s attorney, Ephraim McDowell began the hearing, arguing that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan for the Eastern District of Virginia brought his client’s case before a grand jury alone despite having “no authority to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, then a White House adviser, was appointed after the previous interim US Attorney for the district was pressured to pursue indictments against the two, who Trump repeatedly has attacked and demanded be charged.\n \n\n   \n  One lawyer for the Justice Department, Henry Whitaker, argued Thursday that Comey and James were trying to “elevate what is at best a paperwork error.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey is charged with making a false statement to Congress and James with bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    The limit does not exist, DOJ argues\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of Thursday’s dispute is whether the 120-day limit imposed for interim US attorneys is truly a limit or a guidance for when the attorney general needs to reassess their selection.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorneys argue that following the limit, an interim appointee must be confirmed by the Senate or have their appointment extended by the judges of the district they serve.\n \n\n   \n  If Halligan can be appointed as the head prosecutor of the Alexandria, Virginia, office despite the limit on individuals serving in the job on an interim basis, McDowell argued, then that guardrail is useless.\n \n\n   \n  Her appointment, he said, acted as an “evasion of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued Thursday that the “government’s reading” of the federal law at issue requires the judge “to add words” to it.\n \n\n   \n  The underlying statute, Whitaker said, doesn’t say the attorney general can only “cram multiple appointments” in one, 120-day period, but instead can continue to select and re-evaluate.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not argue that the attorney general,” Whitaker continued, has a “fire and forget” authority. “The idea that we are going to try to evade Senate confirmation,” is “fanciful.”\n \n\n   \n     US v Trump  \n \n\n   \n  The Judge presiding over the issue of Halligan’s appointment, Cameron McGowan Currie, pressed Whitaker Thursday on whether the government believed the classified documents case in Florida against Donald Trump was incorrectly dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in that case,  Aileen Cannon,  found that then-special counsel Jack Smith was wrongly appointed in part because the Senate had not confirmed him to the role.\n \n\n   \n  The question drew gasps from the audience in the courtroom and came toward the tail end of the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker proceeded to walk a tight legal rope by arguing that Smith would not have even met the qualifications for a US Attorney and enjoyed “unique and broad” powers as a special counsel.\n \n\n   \n  “You wouldn’t have appointed Jack Smith” as a US attorney, Whitaker said, adding that “the attorney general has full authority” to appoint those who qualify.\n \n\n   \n     Missing time  \n \n\n   \n  Currie also laid into Whitaker during the hearing on whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had reviewed the grand jury transcript in James Comey’s case, noting there was no record of anything that happened after 4:28pm ET that day. Comey wasn’t indicted for nearly two hours after that, according to available court transcripts.\n \n\n   \n  “It became obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the entire proceeding, Currie said, adding that it appeared “there was no court reporter present” at the time of the missing portion.\n \n\n   \n  In preparation for Thursday’s hearing, Currie privately reviewed the transcripts and said previously that she thought looking at the transcripts was “necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN following the hearing, a representative for the Justice Department denied that there was anything missing from the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no ‘missing two hours.’ That time period refers to when the jurors were deliberating behind closed doors, which would not be included in a transcription,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ, however, did not offer an explanation for the gap in court.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said she would issue a decision over Halligan’s appointment before Thanksgiving, with both trials currently set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/20th-strike-us-military-boats-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:58:00Z","title":"US military carried out 20th strike on alleged drug boats, killing 4, official says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted its 20th strike on an alleged drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing four people, bringing the total fatalities to 80.

Trump administration officials  have acknowledged  they do not necessarily know the identities of the individuals aboard the vessels before they are targeted.\n \n\n   \n  The strike occurred on Monday, the official said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously announced two Sunday strikes, the 18th and 19th conducted by the US military, on two vessels each with three people aboard. Hegseth said in a post on X the following day that those strikes killed all six. The 20th strike was first reported   by CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  The attack   brings the total number of people killed by the US military’s strikes on the alleged drug boats to 80.

The ongoing campaign has also begun to surface tensions with allies; the United Kingdom has stopped sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels to avoid being complicit in the strikes,  CNN reported this week , which the UK believes are illegal. The president of Colombia also said this week that he had ordered his country to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the attacks stop.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Wall Street has its worst day in a month as traders dial back expectations for Fed rate cuts","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced its worst day in a month on November 13, 2025, as investors reacted to the end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.

(The White House said the emails “prove absolutely nothing.”)\n \n\n   \n  In one of those emails from 2011, Epstein expressed surprise to accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump’s name hadn’t surfaced amid accusations involving Epstein. Epstein added that Trump had at one point spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2019, Epstein appeared to signal Trump was quite aware of Maxwell recruiting girls from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 2000s, saying “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  While some have claimed these emails show Trump had knowledge of or even involvement in Epstein’s crimes, it’s not nearly so evident. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has acknowledged meeting Trump and never accused him of wrongdoing. And Trump has acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees including Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. (The big question there is whether Trump had any inkling about what Maxwell was recruiting a minor female like Giuffre  for .)\n \n\n   \n  But also notable on Wednesday was Trump’s reaction.\n \n\n   \n  As all this was going down, he and his White House seemed preoccupied with what appeared to an  11th-hour campaign to thwart  a House discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing the full Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  With the petition due to get a decisive 218th signature when a new Democratic member of Congress was sworn in later that day, the White House held a meeting in the Situation Room with a key GOP lawmaker who’d signed on, while another said she was playing phone tag with the president. Both GOP congresswomen later told CNN Trump hadn’t personally lobbied them to remove their names. But the president also  publicly pressured  Republicans who sided with Democrats on forcing Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  It was a weird move, to be sure. No Republicans removed their names from the petition, and Speaker Mike Johnson quickly said he would schedule a vote for next week on compelling the Justice Department to release the full files.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the measure passes in the House, that’s not the end of the story. The GOP-led Senate would still have to take it up, and Trump would still have to sign it. So it’s not like this will cause the imminent release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s resistance to something his base has long clamored for – and the optics of the Situation Room meeting in particular – would only seem to deepen the huge suspicions that a large number of Americans already harbor about the government covering up Epstein-related matters.\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at the big point here – and the political danger for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  This is merely the latest baffling episode in the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. Among  the others :\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump doesn’t have anything to hide, the danger here is in making it look a whole lot like he does.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are primed to believe there’s a real conspiracy beneath the surface, and Trump’s actions risk making him own it.\n \n\n   \n  The polling tells the tale.\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps Trump’s worst issue, by the margin who disapprove. Americans generally disapprove of his and the administration’s handling of the Epstein matter by around a 3-to-1 margin in most polls. The most recent poll, a Reuters-Ipsos survey from last month, showed Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of it 57%-19%. Independents disapproved 59%-10%.\n \n\n   \n  And like virtually every other survey on the topic, not even a majority of Republicans said they approved: 44%.\n \n\n   \n  Americans are also quite unhappy with the administration’s transparency and disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  An August  Pew Research Center survey  showed 63% of Americans and even 38% of Republican-leaning Americans had little or no trust in what the Trump administration was saying about the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, an  August Quinnipiac University poll  showed voters said 73%-16% that the Justice Department wasn’t being transparent about its investigation.\n \n\n   \n  All of that said, this is clearly not a top-tier issue for most Americans. Relatively few have seemed to be paying close attention. Only about one-quarter were following it “extremely” or “very” closely in the  Pew survey .\n \n\n   \n  But crucially, it’s also something Americans are liable to believe the worst about.\n \n\n   \n  To wit:\n \n\n   \n  That same poll showed even 33% of Republicans said Trump hadn’t gone far enough to get to the bottom of Epstein matters.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, only 26% of Americans and just 55% of Republicans were willing to rule out that Trump had engaged in crime with Epstein. (Trump hasn’t been charged with any crimes related to Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s a lot of Americans who are inclined to believe the worst here – or are at least willing to entertain it. People also seem to have very little confidence and trust in what the administration is doing or saying about all of this.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s conduct just keeps giving them reason to be suspicious.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/health/covid-vaccine-federal-recommendations-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00-05:00","title":"Conflicting advice on Covid shots likely to ding already low vaccine rates, experts warn","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vaccination rates for the covid vaccine in the U.S. have declined significantly, with only 23% of American adults receiving at least one dose during the 2024-25 season, despite ongoing public health risks.

About 75% of Americans had received  at least one dose  of the first versions of the vaccine by early 2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. But only about 23% of American adults got a covid shot during the 2024-25 virus season, well below the 47% of American adults who got a flu shot. The vaccination rates for  flu ,  measles , and tetanus are also going down.\n \n\n   \n  Yet covid remains a serious, potentially deadly health risk, listed as the primary cause of death on roughly 31,400 death certificates last year. By comparison, flu killed  about 6,500  people and pneumonia, a common complication of the flu, killed  an additional 41,600 ,  CDC data shows .\n \n\n   \n  As millions of Americans decide whether to get a covid shot this season, public health researchers worry vaccination rates will slide further, especially because Hispanic and Black Americans and those under 30 have lower rates, exposing them to serious complications such as long covid. Under the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the federal government has narrowed its recommendations on the covid vaccine, leading to a hodgepodge of rules on pharmacy access, with Americans living in Republican states often facing more barriers to getting a shot.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of misinformation is going around regarding covid,” said  Alein Haro-Ramos , an assistant professor of health, society, and behavior at the University of California-Irvine. “Vaccine hesitancy is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Food and Drug Administration  narrowed approval  for covid vaccines to those 65 or older and to adults and children with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for serious complications from covid.\n \n\n   \n  A month later, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  voted to recommend  “shared clinical decision-making” on the vaccine, pulling back from advising all adults to get vaccinated. The committee advised doctors to emphasize to adults under 65 and children that the benefits of the vaccine are greatest for those with underlying health conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance is rebutted by infectious disease experts who say most adults and children should get both the flu and covid vaccines, which are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. Several independent medical organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have reiterated their support for broad adoption of covid vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen states have taken steps to ensure most people can get a covid shot at the pharmacy without a prescription, with many states tying their policies to the advice given by medical organizations. And many of those states require insurers to cover vaccines at no cost, according to  a KFF analysis . In several other states, predominantly Republican, pharmacy access to vaccines may require a prescription.\n \n\n   \n  Among the most commonly cited reasons for covid vaccine hesitation are fears about side effects, long-term health consequences, the effectiveness of the vaccine, and mistrust of pharmaceutical corporations and government officials, according to  a 2024 review  of multiple studies, published in the journal Vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Covid vaccine hesitancy in the 2024-25 virus season was higher among Latinos; African Americans; men; uninsured people; and people living in Republican-leaning states, CDC data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Latino adults were significantly less likely than adults from most other racial and ethnic groups to get a covid shot last season, with a vaccination rate around 15%.\n \n\n   \n  Some of that may be due to age: A  disproportionate share  of Latinos are young. But public policy actions may also be a factor. The first Trump administration, for example, tied Medicaid to “public charge,” a rule allowing the federal government to deny an immigrant a green card or visa based on their dependence on taxpayer-funded programs. Some Latinos may be afraid to sign up for social services even after the Biden administration reversed those first-term Trump actions.\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos co-authored  a study  published in 2024 that found many Latinos were hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears about their immigration status, and that experiencing health discrimination like care denials or delays increased their vaccine hesitancy.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you trust the health care system, broadly speaking? Do you want to provide your information — your name, your address?” Haro-Ramos said. “Trust is critical.”\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos said the problem has likely worsened since her study was published. The Trump administration  revealed this summer  that it would give the personal information of Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many Latinos are  canceling doctor appointments  to head off possible confrontation with immigration enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  “People are avoiding leaving their homes at all costs,” Haro-Ramos said.\n \n\n   \n   Janani Rajbhandari-Thapa , an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, recently  co-authored a study  of covid vaccination among nearly 1,500 African Americans living in south Georgia. The study found that participants were more likely to listen to their health care providers than faith leaders or co-workers when seeking advice on getting vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of those studied had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but those who were unvaccinated were more likely to agree with false statements that tied vaccines to miscarriages, components’ remaining in the body for a long time, or even to the conspiracy that they implant a computer chip in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the clinicians who can take the messages about vaccination — that these are myths,” Rajbhandari-Thapa said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though covid hospitalization and death rates have fallen dramatically since the worst days of the pandemic, fatal complications related to covid remain most common among older people.  Around 89%  of U.S. covid deaths last year were among people 65 and older, compared with  about 81%  of flu and pneumonia deaths.\n \n\n   \n  As the pandemic falls into the rearview, young people have developed a sense of invincibility. Only 11% of Americans 18 to 29 received a vaccine during the 2024-25 virus season, the lowest vaccination rate among adult age groups. That’s far below the  70% of young adults  who got at least one dose of the initial covid vaccines by November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  While many people get covid after receiving a covid shot, because the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection wears off pretty fast, some misunderstand the purpose of the shot, said  Otto Yang , an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health.\n \n\n   \n  “They think, ‘Well, the vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting covid, so the vaccine didn’t work,’” Yang said. “And what they’re not seeing is that the vaccine prevented them from getting severely ill, which is ultimately the most important thing.”\n \n\n   \n  And the vaccine can help prevent long covid, which is a problem for all ages, Yang said. A recent Northwestern University study  found that  younger adults suffer worse symptoms of long covid than older adults.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Yang said, it is not a consistent choice to get a flu vaccine but forgo a covid vaccine, since both are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. It is clear, he added, that people with compromised immune systems and those at higher risk should get a covid shot. The decision is “a little bit less clear” for others but “probably most adults should be getting vaccinated, just like it’s recommended for the flu vaccine, as well as most children.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/chuy-garcia-election-gluesenkamp-perez","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"House Democrat accuses fellow Democrat of attempting to ‘anoint an heir’ in surprise floor move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a surprising and controversial move, House Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington launched a floor resolution to sanction fellow Democrat Chuy García of Illinois, accusing him of 'anointing an heir' by designating his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, as the sole successor to his House seat.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington took to the floor to launch the process of sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire — which meant that his hand-picked successor was the only person registered to run for his seat.\n \n\n   \n  Gluesenkamp Perez announced on the floor that she intends to force a vote to condemn García for the move, accusing him of “undermining the process of a free and fair election.” She is using special procedural powers — known as privilege — that mean her resolution is likely to get a vote on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement after her floor speech, Gluesenkamp Perez said García is attempting to “anoint an heir.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences. Americans bled and died to secure the right to elect their leaders. We can’t expect to be taken seriously in the fight for free and fair elections if we turn a blind eye to election denial on our side of the aisle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The move by the Washington Democrat shocked her own party. Multiple members told CNN that their party — including leadership — had no idea it was coming. Some were angry, insisting that Gluesenkamp Perez was going after García at an already fragile moment for the Democratic party, which was splintered over the ending of the 43-day government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But some Democrats have also called out García for the timing of his decision not to seek reelection in a way that effectively meant no other candidate could enter the race. That includes Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey — who succeeded former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was forced out of Congress because of a corruption scandal.\n \n\n   \n  “Rep Chuy García’s decision to end his re-election at the last second and plant his chief of staff as the only candidate to succeed him was undemocratic and should not be allowed. Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim  posted on X  after Gluesenkamp Perez announced her petition on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  García announced on November 4 that he would not run again for his House seat, citing the health of his wife, the death of his daughter in 2023 and his formal adoption of his grandchild just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, filed petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections to run for the seat that same day, just ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline for filing. But the congressman had already planned not to run, according to a report by  the Chicago Sun-Times.  (Patty Garcia has no relation to the congressman.)\n \n\n   \n  The congressman addressed the criticism  in an interview  with a local Illinois political publication, Capitol Fax, saying “I think I followed the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  As for his decision, García said many in his family were “begging” him not to run again after the adoption of his grandchild and his daughter’s death two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Those were just really big factors in me deciding that I could not, in good conscience, do it again, and decided in Washington one of those nights that the only recourse we had was to look at an option. And that’s when I thought that we could try to get my chief, Patty Garcia, on the ballot,” García told Capitol Fax.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN for comment, García’s office referred to a statement in which he said he “followed every rule and every filing requirement laid out by the State of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “Congressman García made a deeply personal decision based on his health, his wife’s worsening condition and his responsibility to the grandchildren he is raising after the death of his daughter,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  And some of his colleagues have defended the congressman.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois  called  García an “an unwavering fighter for our democracy and our communities,” in response to the move to sanction him.\n \n\n   \n  “It is disappointing that someone willing to compromise working families’ healthcare would use this moment for a cheap political stunt aimed at distracting people from an indefensible vote on tonight’s CR,” she said, referring to the fact that Gluesenkamp Perez  voted in favor of the bill  to reopen the government, which did not include an extension of expiring health care subsidies – a key demand from Democrats in the funding fight.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/tech/ai-safety-task-force-attorneys-general-openai-microsoft","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"OpenAI and Microsoft team up with state law enforcers on AI safety task force","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan coalition of North Carolina and Utah attorneys general, Jeff Jackson and Derek Brown, has launched an AI Task Force in partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft to establish voluntary safeguards for AI safety, focusing on protecting children and identifying emerging risks.

OpenAI and Microsoft have already signed on to the effort, and the attorneys general expect other state regulators and AI companies to join, too. The group will work to develop “basic safeguards” that AI developers should implement to prevent harm to users, especially children, and to identify new risks as the technology develops.\n \n\n   \n  There is no overarching federal law regulating AI, and some federal lawmakers have even sought to restrict regulation of the technology. Jackson and Brown were among the 40 attorneys general who earlier this year successfully  pushed for the removal  of an  AI regulation moratorium  from Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cuts package that could have blocked enforcement of state laws for a decade. (One federal AI law did pass this year: the  Take It Down Act , which specifically cracks down on non-consensual deepfake pornography.)\n \n\n   \n  Concerns about AI safety risks have only escalated in recent months, amid a growing  string of reports  about the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Facebook-parent Meta have also been scrambling to block young people from accessing adult content.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said he’s not hopeful Congress will move quickly to regulate AI.\n \n\n   \n  “They did nothing with respect to social media, nothing with respect for internet privacy, not even for kids, and they came very close to moving in the wrong direction on AI by handcuffing states from doing anything real,” Jackson told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of the task force announcement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the leading AI companies have begun to diverge in their approaches to safety. For example, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  said last month  that the company’s investments in child safety protections would enable it to “treat adults like adults,” including allowing verified adult users to engage in erotic conversations. Shortly after, Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  told CNN  his company would not allow sexual or romantic conversations, even for adults, and that he wanted to make “an AI you trust your kids to use” without a separate, young user experience.\n \n\n   \n  “This effort reflects a shared commitment to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while working collaboratively with stakeholders to understand and mitigate unintended consequences,” Kia Floyd, Microsoft’s general manager of state government affairs, said in a statement on joining the task force. “By partnering with state leaders and industry peers, we can promote innovation and consumer protection to ensure AI serves the public good.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever guardrails the task force develops will technically be voluntary. But the group will have another benefit, too: bringing states’ top law enforcement officers together to track AI developments and risks, potentially making it easier for them to take joint legal action if tech companies harm consumers. That makes this effort different from “a group of think tanks coming together” to create AI safety principles, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson would still like Congress to pass more AI legislation. But, he said, “Congress has left a vacuum and I think it makes sense for AGs to try to fill it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/28/entertainment/holiday-movies-bingo-game","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00-05:00","title":"Give Yourself the Gift of Playing Holiday Movie Bingo","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes holiday movie bingo as a fun, non-controversial activity for families during Thanksgiving gatherings.

blood and claimed she could multiply gnocchi for her followers, has been charged with fraud, along with her husband. They are due to stand trial in April.\n \n\n   \n  For years, faithful Catholic pilgrims flocked to a field outside Rome, belonging to Gisella Cardia – born Maria Giuseppa Scarpulla – and her husband Gianni Cardia, to pray in front of the statue of the Madonna of Trevignano. The statue was said to weep blood and transmit messages Gisella Cardia claimed were both from God and Satan, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who have been denounced by the Vatican, created a shrine to the Madonna statuette and regularly held prayer events, during which Gisella Cardia would take to the stage and preach.\n \n\n   \n  Her followers have told media that, although Gisella Cardia did not multiply bread and loaves, she would often show up with one box of pizza or a plate of gnocchi that somehow multiplied to feed the masses.\n \n\n   \n  The couple also collected nearly €400,000 ($465,000) between 2018 and 2024 from those who came to pray in front of the statue, promising that the money would go to children’s hospital, the prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia, which has charged them with fraud, confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor’s office has alleged that the money was used to spruce up the pilgrimage site and for a $40,000 car, and was not taxed in accordance with religious donations.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who will face trial in April, are accused of staging “apparitions” to make it seem that blood was flowing from the Madonna statue’s eyes for money.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged scam came to light in 2023 after a former follower contacted police. In an interview with state broadcaster RAI, he said he told officers that he’d found a coffin in his car following an alleged confrontation with Gisella Cardia.\n \n\n   \n  Police launched an investigation, testing the blood which turned out to match Gisella Cardia’s DNA, geneticist Emiliano Giardina of the public prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia said in a court report.\n \n\n   \n  At that time,  the Vatican  released a statement warning pilgrims to be wary of “the alleged apparitions and revelations reported by Mrs. Gisella Cardia… and by Mr. Gianni Cardia,” which it said had been judged to be  not supernatural .\n \n\n   \n  The couple’s lawyer Solange Marchignoli told CNN Thursday: “(Gisella) Cardia is relieved, as she believes this moment represents an opportunity to transparently reveal the truth of the facts and to definitively put an end to all forms of speculation, misunderstanding, and controversy that have, despite herself, involved her in recent months.” Marchignoli added that the couple “welcomed the trial and said it would be a necessary step to finally clarify, in the appropriate venues, every aspect of the case involving her.”\n \n\n   \n  One woman told a local news channel in an interview later broadcast by RAI that she witnessed Gisella Cardia multiplying pizza.\n \n\n   \n  “We were at her house for a rosary, and there were about 20 or 25 of us. After the rosary, we decided to stay there for a while to talk. At one point, someone brought a box of pizza. A person near us cut it and each of us went over there and took a little piece at a time… We all ate it. The pizza was never ending and this is all the work of Divine Providence through Gisella,” the woman said.\n \n\n   \n  Gisella Cardia herself also recounted a similar instance in an interview with La Repubblica newspaper when allegations of into fraud first surfaced in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “There was lunch left over, consisting of gnocchi and a bit of rabbit,” she said. “Everyone ate the gnocchi and rabbit, 15 people, and it’s incredible.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday he was classifying four groups in Germany, Italy, and Greece as Specially Designated Global Terrorists and intends to designate them as foreign terrorist organizations effective next week.\n \n\n   \n  The designations put the groups – Antifa Ost, Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI), Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice – in the same category with groups like ISIS-K and al-Shabaab.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes  amid a push  by President Donald Trump to target the Antifa movement, which often leans to the political left and lacks centralized structure or defined leadership.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump signed an order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and directing federal agencies to take action against it.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio on Thursday accused Antifa groups of ascribing to “revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, ‘anti-capitalism,’ and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas.”\n \n\n   \n  According to a State Department fact sheet, Germany-based Antifa Ost conducted attacks on individuals it deemed as “fascists” in Germany between 2018 and 2023 “and is accused of having conducted a series of attacks in Budapest in mid-February 2023.” It was designated as a terrorist organization in Hungary earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “FAI/FRI has claimed responsibility for threats of violence, bombs, and letter bombs against political and economic institutions, including a courthouse and other ‘capitalist institutions,’” the State Department fact sheet said.\n \n\n   \n  The fact sheet said Revolutionary Class Self-Defense had “claimed responsibility for two IED attacks targeting the Greece Ministry of Labor (February 3, 2024) and the Hellenic Train offices (April 11, 2025),” and that Armed Proletarian Justice “claimed responsibility for planting a bomb near the Greek riot police headquarters in Goudi, Greece on December 18, 2023.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result of the designations, any assets in the US from the groups will be blocked, and Americans are prohibited from “knowingly” providing material support to them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you plan to max out your contributions to your 401(k) or IRA next year, you will get to save a little more than you could this year.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS on Thursday announced cost-of-living adjustments to federal contribution limits for 2026 for key retirement savings vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  401(k) participants will be allowed to   put away up to $24,500 next year, a $1,000 increase from the current limit. The same increase will apply to 403(b)s, governmental 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone 50 or older in those plans can save more. Next year the so-called “catch-up contribution” limit rises to $8,000 from $7,500, for a total of $32,500. But those who are ages 60, 61, 62, and 63 may save even more – up to an additional $11,250, which is the same limit as this year, for a total of $35,750.\n \n\n   \n  There is another change, however, for the highest-earning older savers. Starting in 2026, if in the prior year you made more than $145,000 in FICA wages — that is income subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes — any catch-up contributions you make will  automatically be subject to income tax . So they essentially will be treated as  Roth 401(k)  contributions.\n \n\n   \n    New savings and income limits for traditional and Roth IRAs\n \n\n   \n  If you are eligible to put money into a tax-deductible IRA or an after- tax Roth IRA, you will be allowed to save up to $7,500, which is $500 more than you can sock away this year.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit if you’re at least 50 will be $1,100, up from $1,000 today.\n \n\n   \n  The income thresholds to determine whether you’re eligible to save in those IRA vehicles are also being adjusted.\n \n\n   \n  Those thresholds differ based both on your marital status and whether or not you’re covered by a retirement savings plan at work. (Here are the IRS’ new  income threshold breakdowns  across those categories.)\n \n\n   \n    Limits for Saver’s Credit and SIMPLE Accounts also change\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a low- or moderate-income worker, you may be eligible for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, also known as the  Saver’s Credit . It’s essentially a government-provided match on at least a portion of your retirement contributions to an IRA or workplace retirement plan. The credit, which won’t change next year, is worth up to $1,000 for single filers; and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n \n\n   \n  To qualify in 2026, your income may not exceed $40,250 if you’re a single filer or married filing separately, which is up $750 from this year’s income limit. If you file as head of household, your income may not be more than $60,375, up $1,125 compared to this year. And it may not top $80,500 if you’re married filing jointly, up $1,500.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re employed by a small business offering a  SIMPLE IRA  at work and put retirement savings into a SIMPLE account, you may save up to $17,000 next year, up from $16,500 today; although for some types of SIMPLE accounts the contribution limit rises to $18,100, up from $17,600.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit will be increased to $4,000 from $3,500 currently. Savers who are between the ages of 60 and 63 may contribute an additional $5,250, which is the same as this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:35:00-20:35","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 80","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military has conducted 20 strikes between September 2 and November 10, 2025, killing 80 people on 21 vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans.

2:35 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 80 people in 20 strikes that have destroyed 21 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n    November 6\n \n\n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, killing three people, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters,” Hegseth said in a  post on X , adding that US forces were not harmed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n    November 9\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific according, to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n    November 10\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon conducted  its 20th strike   on an alleged drug trafficking boat on November 10, a Defense Department official said on November 13.\n \n\n   \n  “The strike occurred in the Caribbean and four narco-terrorists were killed, no survivors,” the official confirmed in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/toy-story-5-teaser-watch-now","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-05:00","title":"Screens are the enemy in new ‘Toy Story 5’ teaser trailer","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The new teaser trailer for 'Toy Story 5' raises a timely cultural question: can physical toys remain relevant in an age dominated by screens?

Kevin Stitt has spared the life of a death row inmate just before he was set to receive a lethal injection on Thursday, commuting the man’s sentence to life in prison without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt formally granted clemency to Tremane Wood, 46, who was scheduled to die for the stabbing death of a man during a botched robbery in 2002. It is just the second time the Republican governor has granted clemency during his nearly seven years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation to commute Tremane Wood’s sentence to life without parole,” Stitt announced.\n \n\n   \n  “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” the governor said.\n \n\n   \n  In his executive order commuting Wood’s sentence, Stitt says Wood shall not be eligible to apply for or be considered for a commutation, pardon or parole for the rest of his life.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt previously granted clemency to  death row inmate Julius Jones  in 2021, but had rejected clemency recommendations in four other cases. A total of 16 men have been executed during Stitt’s time in office.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment with the governor’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I am disappointed that the governor has granted clemency for this dangerous murderer, but respect that this was his decision to make,” Drummond said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Wood was scheduled to die for his role in the killing of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farmworker from Montana, during an attempted robbery at a north Oklahoma City hotel early on New Year’s Day in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves, said she and her legal team are “profoundly grateful” for Stitt’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace,” her statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Wipf grew up in a Hutterite religious community in Montana, and his family and the surviving victim of the attack supported his clemency, Castro Alves said.\n \n\n   \n  George Burnett, one of the original prosecutors, said he’s concerned that a five-member parole board can have such a profound impact on a case that has been litigated for more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “Ronnie Wipf is buried on a lonely hill somewhere on the plains of Montana, and when his family visits him, they wonder what might have been,” Burnett said.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma’s Pardon and Parole Board  voted 3-2 last week  to recommend that the governor grant clemency.\n \n\n   \n  During the clemency hearing, Wood’s attorneys didn’t deny that he participated in the robbery but maintained that his brother, Zjaiton Wood, was the one who actually stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood was sentenced to life without parole. Before he died in prison in 2019, he admitted to several people that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.\n \n\n   \n  Castro Alves told the panel Tremane Wood had an ineffective trial attorney who was drinking heavily at the time and who did little work on the case. She also said trial prosecutors improperly concealed from jurors the benefits that witnesses received in exchange for their testimony. Wood’s attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution on these grounds, but were denied.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while in prison, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering attacks on other inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Wood, who testified to the panel via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but denied being the one who killed Wipf.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a monster. I’m not a killer. I never was and I never have been,” Wood said.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorneys also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution, but the court denied that request early Thursday.

will co-author a children’s book next year focused on the Declaration of Independence, a departure from the headier book the conservative jurist authored last year that  targeted burdensome government  regulations.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be titled “Heroes of 1776: The Story of The Declaration of Independence” and is set to publish in May, which Gorsuch indicated is timed to correspond to the 250th anniversary of the document’s signing.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the next year we’ll celebrate a lot of dates and events with fireworks and   I wanted to share with children some stories about the courage and sacrifice of the heroes behind 1776 who gave us our Constitution and our liberties,” Gorsuch told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be published by HarperCollins.\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch, who was President Donald Trump’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, published a decidedly adult book just last year that lamented out-of-control government bureaucracies and told the stories of Americans he said had been hampered by overzealous regulations and red tape.\n \n\n   \n  In that book, Gorsuch told the story a commercial fisherman in Florida who was threatened with a 20-year prison sentence for tossing undersized grouper overboard – a case that was decided by  the Supreme Court  in 2015. He also wrote about Marty Hahne, a Missouri magician who became a  cause célèbre for anti-regulation advocates   a decade ago when the US Department of Agriculture required him to draft an emergency disaster plan for Casey, a rabbit he pulled out of a hat at his shows.\n \n\n   \n  In June,  Gorsuch reported receiving a little over $250,000 in book royalties  – a roughly equal amount to what he reported a year before. Supreme Court justices, who earn more than $300,000 a year, are barred from receiving more than about $30,000 in outside income annually. But book revenue is exempt from that policy, creating an incentive for the nine to put pen to paper beyond their opinions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, has authored several children’s books, including one this year. Sotomayor reported nearly $134,000 in book-related income in her most recent financial disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett both zigzagged across the country this fall promoting new books.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh is working on book now. So is Justice  Samuel Alito .\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch is writing the book with Janie Nitze, who also co-authored Gorsuch’s book last year. It will be illustrated by Chris Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  In a promotional statement, HarperCollins said the new book would “dive into the stories of ordinary people willing to do extraordinary things” around the time of nation’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to know our shared history, and I think if we do that we’ll come to realize that all the things that separate us pale in comparison to the things that unite us,” Gorsuch told Fox. “I wanted to be part of America’s celebration and bringing us together again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/entertainment/sean-combs-release-date-2028","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ prison release date set for 2028","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a prominent music mogul, is serving a 50-month federal sentence for transporting women for prostitution after being convicted in a two-month trial, with no conviction on more serious charges of sex trafficking or racketeering.

than he thought.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Prisons pushed Combs’ release date to June 4, 2028, according to the agency’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ original release date – first reported in October, more than three months after a jury delivered a mixed verdict in his federal trial – had been scheduled for May 8, 2028.\n \n\n   \n  No explanation was given by the Bureau of Prisons for the pushed back date  and representatives couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The change could reflect an updated calculation or punishment if an infraction, if any, occurred.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ spokesman Juda Engelmayer told CNN they have not been given an explanation for the changed date yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still trying to find out what the dates mean and why and what the issue is, if there is one” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs was accepted into the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program, known as RDAP, at the low security prison in Fort Dix, NJ. Inmates who participate in the program often receive credits that can reduce time from their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “His only goal is he wants to work on himself, do better, be better, and get back to his family and be the father that they need. He’s not going to do anything to hurt that,” Engelmayer said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs had been sentenced to 50 months (roughly more than four years) by a judge after a two-month trial ended with him being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs was acquitted by a jury of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering for which he was facing decades and possibly life in prison if convicted.\n \n\n   \n  He has already served 13 months in jail and that will be credited to his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  He had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest. In late  October , Combs was transferred on Thursday to  Fort Dix , a low-security federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is appealing his conviction and sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ defense previously told CNN that they had approached President Donald Trump’s administration about a potential pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ attorney Nicole Westmoreland  told CNN  in August that it was her “understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon.” At the time, a White House official told CNN they “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any clemency request.”\n \n\n   \n  In October after Combs’ sentencing, Trump confirmed that Combs had requested a presidential pardon in connection with his federal criminal case,  telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins  “a lot of people have asked me for pardons,” including Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously indicated that he was unlikely to pardon Combs during an  interview  with Newsmax, saying, “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.” Trump said that this made pardoning Combs “more difficult to do.”\n \n\n   \n  During his trial, Combs’ defense admitted to his pattern of violent behavior against women with whom he was in romantic relationships over the years. The jury was repeatedly shown footage — first published in 2024 by CNN — of Combs violently beating his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016. The jury was also shown images of bloody gashes and bruises on Ventura’s body during trial.\n \n\n   \n  Ventura was the star witness of the case and testified that she was repeatedly abused by Combs and forced to take drugs and have sex with other men against her will throughout their 10-year relationship, during which he controlled her career and finances. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” also recounted psychological, financial and physical abuse by Combs who she said forced her to have sex with other men while she was under the influence of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  At his sentencing, judge Arun Submaranian  admonished Combs  for his abuse and rejected the defense’s “attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate consensual experiences or just a sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll story.” Submaranian said that the prosecution’s case “showed that (Combs) abused the power and control (he) had over the women (he) professed to love dearly.”\n \n\n   \n  “You abused them physically, emotionally and psychologically and you used that abuse to get your way,” he said, addressing Combs. “This was subjugation, and it drove both Ms. Ventura and Jane to thoughts of ending their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs is also facing roughly 70 civil lawsuits where most of the dozens of accusers — some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged incidents — claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs has denied all of the civil claims. Some of the lawsuits have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.

Key figures include former energy minister German Galushchenko, who has resigned amid allegations, and Timur Mindich, a former business partner of Zelensky, who has fled Ukraine and is under sanctions.

Ukraine’s ability to withstand the  Russian campaign , and carefully ration its power supplies, served only to cement its leader Volodymyr Zelensky’s credibility at home.\n \n\n   \n  Three years on, the picture is rather more difficult. Ukraine’s president finds himself under fire over a burgeoning energy sector corruption scandal, while his people face a fourth tough winter, with power cuts and heating outages as severe as ever.\n \n\n   \n  On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces find themselves losing ground across the east, most critically in the one-time  logistics hub of Pokrovsk , as key Western allies appear to be focused elsewhere. The war may still be Ukraine’s overriding priority, but corruption is likely Zelensky’s most immediate concern.\n \n\n   \n  The scandal, which centers on alleged kickbacks from contractors including those working to protect critical energy infrastructure, has already taken down two of Zelensky’s ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the government announced it was suspending German Galushchenko, the justice minister, who previously served as energy minister. Galushchenko said he would defend himself in the face of the allegations. Both he and his successor as energy minister have since submitted their resignations at Zelensky’s urging; swift parliamentary approval is expected.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Ukraine’s anti-corruption body announced it had carried out searches on dozens of properties – including one linked to Galushchenko – as part of an investigation into the alleged kickbacks.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said about $100 million had been siphoned off – between 10-15% of the value of the contracts – as state-owned businesses including Energoatom, which operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, paid companies for work done to enhance security at key sites.\n \n\n   \n  That the latest corruption scandal involves the energy sector gives it a particular edge. People in Kyiv are currently without electricity for eight to 11 hours per day, a result of Russia’s improved ability to strike  power plants and substations .\n \n\n   \n  Diesel generators, purchased during the first blackouts three years ago, have reappeared outside shops and cafes. Candlelit dinners have again become part of the daily routine.\n \n\n   \n  The blackouts can also mean heating is off, lifts in high-rise buildings do not work, and water supply is interrupted. The situation is usually worse in towns and cities outside the capital.\n \n\n   \n     Zelensky name-checked in court \n \n\n   \n  Court hearings on the investigation – live streamed on the public broadcaster’s website – have been underway in Kyiv since Tuesday and look set to continue for at least the next few days. They include snippets of what investigators say are 1,000 hours of recorded conversations between the suspects in the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a potentially damaging first, one of the conversations released Wednesday name-checked Zelensky himself. In a transcript read out in court, the man accused of masterminding the corruption scheme, Timur Mindich, appeared to suggest he had influence over the president, boasting to Galushchenko of his success in getting Zelensky to call the then-energy minister on the phone and invite him for a meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript contained no details of that alleged call, and Zelensky has made no comment. It is believed to be the first time his name has been mentioned, albeit indirectly, in a corruption case in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is Mindich himself, perhaps the most awkward element in all this as far as Ukraine’s leader is concerned.\n \n\n   \n  Given the codename Carlson by his alleged co-conspirators, Mindich is a former business partner of Zelensky, dating back to his previous career as a highly successful entertainer and producer.\n \n\n   \n  Mindich himself has made no comment on the accusations against him and has left the country, Ukraine’s state border agency said in a statement late Wednesday. The agency noted he had left legally, adding they had not received an order to stop him. Zelensky’s cabinet has now introduced sanctions on Mindich, which include a block on his business interests and bank accounts.\n \n\n   \n     Defeating Russia and tackling corruption \n \n\n   \n  Corruption allegations are nothing new in Ukraine. During the first months of Moscow’s full scale invasion, there was an unwritten understanding among Ukraine’s journalists and civil society that corruption investigations were not a priority. Defeating Russia was the only thing that mattered.\n \n\n   \n  That consensus began to decay after about a year. Since 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) has opened investigations into a series of scandals, including an illegal land development project involving a deputy prime minister and the embezzlement of public funds allocated to pay for soldiers’ food.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Zelensky has managed to avoid getting dragged into the scandals, though Ukrainians put him on notice in the summer with large anti-government protests – the biggest since the full scale invasion – after he approved a parliamentary move to neuter NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office. He backed down under pressure from key international allies, who have made anti-corruption an important plank of their long-term support for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister under Zelensky and now head of the Kyiv School of Economics, told CNN the president had to “act as harshly as possible” if he wanted to maintain popular support among Ukrainians. “(People) say, ‘Let’s see how he acts… if he’s not acting, then he’s with them (the accused). We’ll know if he’s acting… but if he really sanctions them, arrests them, prosecutes those who allow this to happen, then, okay, he’s good.’”\n \n\n   \n  Until Tuesday, Mylovanov was a member of the supervisory board of Energoatom, before resigning his position over what he said was the failure of company executives to act rapidly on the scandal, though he blamed the foot-dragging on cluelessness rather than corruption.\n \n\n   \n  It is too soon to assess whether this corruption scandal will cause any lasting  damage to Zelensky’s support among Ukrainians. Recent polling conducted by  the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, albeit before the latest allegations, shows popular levels of trust in the Ukrainian leader remaining at around 60% – down on the figures for earlier this year, but consistent with the levels enjoyed in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Tolerance of corruption has declined over the same period, though not dramatically.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hunder, who leads the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said it was essential that those who were stealing from the state were held fully accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a critical moment for Ukraine’s leadership to show that its commitment to integrity and accountability is unwavering,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mylovanov took a more pessimistic view of how the corruption scandal would likely play with the Trump administration, regardless of how Zelensky acts.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if they care or not,” he said. “But they will use it as a leverage point over Zelensky.”\n \n\n   \n   Victoria Butenko and Svitlana Vlasova contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-gas-leak-ammonia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:15:00-05:00","title":"Shelter-in-Place Order Lifted After Hundreds Evacuated and Dozens Hospitalized from Ammonia Gas Leak in Oklahoma","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Weatherford, Oklahoma, a leak of anhydrous ammonia gas from a tanker truck in a hotel parking lot led to respiratory distress among residents, with at least 36 people hospitalized and five transported by helicopter to Oklahoma City.

more of this,’ Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told Epstein, newly released emails show \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:01 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate have once again raised questions over  Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor ’s account of his friendship with the late sex offender and his denials of the allegations of his accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The former prince told Epstein and convicted child sex trafficker  Ghislaine Maxwell  “I can’t take any more of this” when informed 14 years ago that a British newspaper was going to publish a story about the trio.\n \n\n   \n  A fresh tranche of documents provided by Epstein’s estate, some of which also  mentioned US President Donald Trump , was released by the  US House Oversight Committee  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the thousands of documents was the email conversation from March 2011 in which Andrew repeatedly pleaded with the couple to make it clear that he had no involvement in the alleged activities.\n \n\n   \n  “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” Andrew wrote to Epstein. “I can’t take any more of this my end.”\n \n\n   \n  The messages were sent months after Andrew claimed to have severed all ties with the convicted pedophile in December 2010.  CNN has reached out to Andrew for comment following the latest release of material from the House committee.\n \n\n   \n  In what appears to be a separate email chain between the former Duke of York and Maxwell on the same day, discussing a response to the press enquiry from the Mail on Sunday newspaper, he wrote: “Hey there! What’s all this? I don’t know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can’t take any more of this.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew sent his messages after he was forwarded a right-to-reply email by Epstein from the newspaper, in which, he featured in several claims. The email alleged that a woman, whose name has been redacted in the released documents, worked as a masseuse for Epstein and met and had sex with Andrew at Maxwell’s London home in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  It alleged that the masseuse met Andrew again at Epstein’s New York residence where she and another girl were directed by Maxwell to sit on his knee, and he groped them before Maxwell directed the girls to have sex with him.\n \n\n   \n  It also alleged that the woman was later directed to stage an orgy for Andrew and Epstein on the financier’s private Caribbean island, Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  The emails appear to be referring to the claims of Virginia Giuffre, who has spoken extensively about her years of being sexually trafficked, allegedly at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein who  died by suicide  in April, repeatedly claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew while underage on three occasions – in London, New York and on Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  She alleged that third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein’s island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English,” as detailed in her posthumous memoir.\n \n\n   \n  She claimed that the-then prince  was aware  she was underage in the US when they were introduced.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew told the BBC in a television interview in 2019.  He said in the same sit-down that visiting Epstein in 2010  was the “wrong decision”  and that he regretted acting in a manner that was “unbecoming.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein confirms Andrew photo\n \n\n   \n  In another email exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein also appeared to discuss Giuffre and the now infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then-17-year-old. The now former royal has repeatedly said that he has  no recollection of the photograph  being taken and has suggested the image could be fake.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The disgraced financier also appeared to ask the journalist to investigate Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  “I never misled you, this girl is a total liar,” Epstein wrote in the email.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe your paper should jump on and show that (redacted)’s allegations re andrew (sic) are the same, she also accused numnerous (sic) people of having sex with her,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew reached an  out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, after  Giuffre’s memoir  reignited public attention on Andrew’s links to Epstein, he was officially  stripped of his titles  in an extraordinary move by his brother, King Charles III.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee  requested Andrew answer questions  as part of the panel’s investigation into Epstein and his accomplices. Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC that he has not responded yet to the committee’s invitation to testify.\n \n\n   \n    Mandelson in contact with Epstein until 2016, emails show\n \n\n   \n  The new cache of documents from the House committee also seem to shed further light on the extent of the contact between Epstein and Peter Mandelson, who was  recently fired  as British ambassador to the United States over his ties to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein’s birthday two weeks earlier. “63 years old. You made it,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that “you were right about staying away from Andrew.”\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson responds, “Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly what the two men are referring to. CNN has attempted to reach out to Mandelson for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson was fired as Britain’s ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship.\n \n\n   \n  Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson’s ties to Epstein were known prior to his appointment to the post in Washington in 2024. But the September emails sparked a crisis for Britain’s Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with many questioning why he appointed Mandelson despite concerns about his past.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Foreign Office told CNN at the time that the emails showed that “the depth and extent” of the now-ex-ambassador’s relationship with Epstein is “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  Following his dismissal two months ago, Mandelson said in a letter to embassy staff reported by the BBC that he continued “to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/health/pig-kidney-transplant-studies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00-05:00","title":"Doctors say they’re ‘measurably closer’ to making pig kidneys work for humans","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doctors at NYU Langone Health have reported a significant advancement in xenotransplantation, with two new studies showing that pig kidneys can function in humans without being rejected—specifically, a 61-day stable function in a brain-dead recipient, Maurice Miller, and a 271-day success in a living recipient, Tim Andrews.

11:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doctors at NYU Langone Health say two new studies show that they are a significant step closer to making kidney transplants from other species a real option in the near future.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have been searching for years for an alternative to human transplants because the donor supply cannot keep up with demand, particularly where kidneys are concerned.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90,000 people in the US are waiting for a kidney transplant, and about 11 of them die every day,  according to UNOS , the nonprofit that manages the nation’s organ donation system. But with an aging population and the rise in conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, the need will only grow.\n \n\n   \n  Dialysis can keep a person with end-stage kidney disease alive, but the process can be hard on the body and  can typically  sustain someone for only about five years, on average.\n \n\n   \n  In the search for an alternative, scientists have been turning to cross-species organ transplants, called xenotransplantation.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest hurdles they have to overcome is the body’s tendency to reject an organ transplant. New studies published Thursday in the journal Nature offer more information on how to prevent the body from rejecting the pig kidney, and the researchers say they think they’ve had a breakthrough in understanding how the immune system handles these kinds of transplants.\n \n\n   \n    The rejection issue\n \n\n   \n  The human immune system protects the body from threats like fungus or bacteria, but it can sometimes be a little overprotective.\n \n\n   \n  The immune system cannot distinguish between a bad foreign object that enters the body, like a virus, and a good one, like a donor organ. When either is introduced, the immune system goes into full protection mode, sending antibodies to attack whatever it identifies as the problem. Those antibodies can damage the donor organ and ultimately make a transplant fail.\n \n\n   \n  Even with human-to-human transplants, rejection is a big concern. For the rest of their lives, recipients must take powerful anti-rejection drugs that suppress the immune system. When the donor is a pig, scientists also genetically alter the organ to make it more compatible with the human body.\n \n\n   \n  The new studies aimed to take the closest look possible at how the human body rejects a pig organ.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at NYU transplanted an organ from a genetically modified pig into a person who was brain-dead: Maurice Miller, 57, who died from a mass in his brain in July 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors said Miller had always wanted to donate his organs but could not do so because he had cancer. Instead, they asked Miller’s family if they would donate his entire body to research.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers thought an organ transplant into a brain-dead person would allow them to test tissue samples and blood in ways that would be too intrusive with a living recipient or even with a non-human primate, said study co-author Dr. Robert Montgomery, chief of the New York University Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “This decedent might be the most highly studied human in history,” Montgomery said of Miller.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors removed Miller’s own kidneys and transplanted a genetically modified kidney from a specially bred pig from the biotech company Revivicor. Miller’s body was kept alive on a ventilator in the ICU for two months. During that time, doctors biopsied the kidney regularly, monitored his blood and tested other tissue samples.\n \n\n   \n  There were two episodes in which Miller’s body tried to reject the pig kidney, but for the first time in history of xenotransplantation, Montgomery said, they had success with   available rejection medication, and the organ continued to function. They stopped the experiment at day 61.\n \n\n   \n  This part of the work, Montgomery explained, would help doctors better understand what immunosuppressive medications would work best in other people who receive pig organs.\n \n\n   \n  “It also will give us a sense of relief moving forward in the clinical trials that we’re in the middle of right now, to know that when you put a pig kidney in a human, from a physiological standpoint, it just does its thing,” Montgomery said. “The kidney is capable of doing most of the things that a human kidney can do, and the things that it doesn’t, we either have redundancy and we don’t necessarily need it, or there’s a few drugs that we need to supplement. But other than that, we’re good to go.”\n \n\n   \n  The new research, he said, “brings us measurably closer to safe pig-to-human organ transplants.”\n \n\n   \n    Creating a detailed map\n \n\n   \n  During the episodes in which Miller’s body started to reject the organ, the doctors were able to create a detailed map of exactly how his immune system reacted to the pig organ and identify the pathways the body was using to reject it. They also were able to map out the genomics associated with those pathways, mapping 5,100 expressed pig and human genes and pinpointing every immune cell in the body to track immune behavior at this uniquely granular level.\n \n\n   \n  “We really were able to tease apart what happened on a nearly daily basis,” said study co-author Dr Brendan Keating, a member of the faculty in the Department of Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  They could also see   the differences in immune reaction to a pig organ versus what happens with a transplanted human organ.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers said they identified biomarkers in the blood that eventually may be used to detect organ rejection much earlier, before damage could be done.\n \n\n   \n  Although the study is a major step forward, Montgomery said, it involved just one person, so the findings will need to be replicated in others to see whether the reactions are consistent. The researchers just got funding to test immune suppression techniques in 20 additional patients, he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We’re getting better at this’\n \n\n   \n  In the past year alone, scientist have made enormous progress in understanding how pig kidney transplants work.\n \n\n   \n  The most notable success involved the case of Tim Andrews of New Hampshire, the fourth living person in the US to get a kidney from a genetically modified pig.\n \n\n   \n  Andrews set a record when his pig kidney continued to function ﻿for 271 days.  Doctors had to remove  the organ at the end of October, after they noticed a decline in function. But before that point, the transplant had worked so well that Andrews was able to take long walks and even throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game.\n \n\n   \n  The kind of research found in the new studies is important for the field, said Dr. Minnie Sarwal, co-director of the Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program at the University of California San Francisco.   \n \n\n   \n  “Sixty-one days of stable renal function is novel proof of concept, and I think it confirms that genetically engineered pig kidneys can sustain physiological function in human circulation,” said Sarwal, who was not involved with the new research. “As a first step, proof of concept, clearly, is very important, because it is bridging the gap between what we were previously worked working on with short lived preclinical models, and we are able to go to true clinical feasibility, even though it’s obviously not long-term. But 61 days is better than, let’s say, hours, or maybe a few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Sarwal, who focuses on therapeutic innovations for immunosuppression drug design, said the new studies also demonstrated that rejection was treatable.\n \n\n   \n  “That part’s not groundbreaking, but I think it’s very comforting that our current treatments would work in that model, which we expected they would, but confirmation is great to see,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Mapping immune reaction may give researchers other “druggable molecular checkpoints” so they can develop better immunosuppression options for transplant recipients, Sarwal said.\n \n\n   \n  Montgomery thinks his experiment can also give hope that xenotransplantation will be a more viable option someday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting better and better at this, and I think that’s the message that I would like to deliver,” Montgomery said. “There’s going to be ups and downs.

shutdown is over. Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. Staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports will be frozen at 6%, the Department of Transportation said Wednesday night, stopping short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers are now showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain at that level until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “If the FAA safety team determines the trend lines are moving in the right direction, we’ll put forward a path to resume normal operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said Tuesday that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would allow airlines to restore operations before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  But that will take some time.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in an earlier statement.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a statement Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week if the government reopens quickly. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/holiday-travel-spirit-airlines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Flying Will Stay Rough After the Shutdown.

The discount carrier’s rock-bottom fares forced much larger carriers, such as American, Delta and United Airlines, to keep their prices lower. That includes offering lower-priced seats at the back of planes, often on the same no-frills basis as Spirit.\n \n\n   \n  But Spirit, facing severe financial hardship, is now a fraction of the size it was just a year ago. That is impacting fares this holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  Even if flight cancellations because of the government shutdown are restored, there will be nearly 11,000 fewer Spirit flights this holiday season compared to last year, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium analyzed by CNN. That includes the period six days before Thanksgiving through the Sunday after New Year’s Day. The drop represents a one-third reduction in Spirit’s schedule, or a loss of nearly 2 million available seats.\n \n\n   \n  US domestic flights are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site Going.com.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I can’t pinpoint that and say all of that is attributable to Spirit,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for Going.com. “But it definitely is contributing to the higher prices we’re seeing.”\n \n\n   \n  Like most other low-cost carriers, Spirit has continually lost money since 2020, when the pandemic hit. Now in the midst of its  second bankruptcy reorganization,  the company once again warned investors on Tuesday there was “ substantial doubt ” over its ability to stay in business over the next 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Spirit is shuttering immediately. But the airline has been slashing flights in a desperate effort to stem losses, offering far fewer routes.\n \n\n   \n  The routes of virtually every US airline now have less overlap with Spirit than before, Raymond James airlines analyst Savanthi Syth said in a note to clients this week.   And with Spirit flying on fewer routes, the carrier won’t put nearly as much downward pressure on the fares of larger airlines.\n \n\n   \n  In August, when Spirit  first warned investors  about possibly being forced out of business, Spirit CEO Dave Davis told   employees the airline remained “critical” for flyers.\n \n\n   \n  “We have saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, whether they fly with us or not,” he wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/government-shutdown-ends-federal-workers-return","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:16:00-05:00","title":"The government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government shutdown, which lasted 43 days and ended on November 13, 2025, has not restored normal operations.

are not back to normal \n       \n  By Jeremy Herb, Tami Luhby, Sunlen Serfaty, René Marsh, Alexandra Skores, Ella Nilsen, Marshall Cohen, Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:16 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is over. But hundreds of thousands of federal workers   are coming back after 43 days to anything but normalcy, employees from across the country told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Workers who haven’t received a paycheck in weeks will still have to wait for back pay. Research grants will be delayed. Economic reports are likely to be scrapped. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through.\n \n\n   \n  And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers said that the shutdown has been an exclamation point on top of months of chaos as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and, in some cases, entire agencies since the president   took office in January. The administration  sought to fire  more federal workers when the shutdown hit, but the short-term funding deal halted those dismissals until the end of January.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it’s going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.”\n \n\n   \n  For the American public, the lingering effects of the shutdown could be felt for months or even years to come at the nation’s airports. Meanwhile, those receiving government assistance like food stamps are eagerly awaiting the government to finally get funds out the door.\n \n\n   \n    A slew of backlogs\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers back on the clock Thursday will need to assess how to address more than six weeks of   backlogs. Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee.\n \n\n   \n  A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check   their emails at approved times to look   for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn’t lock down after 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  It was “heart wrenching” to see the emails piling up, the person said, including with desperate pleas from parents of disabled children who filed discrimination cases with the department’s Office for Civil Rights. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency’s testing labs, said one worker at the agency’s   Human Foods Program.\n \n\n   \n  Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said.\n \n\n   \n  And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You’re talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.”\n \n\n   \n  A big focus at the National Park Service will be assessing any damage that occurred to parks during the shutdown, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n \n\n   \n  Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said.   But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, many parks didn’t get damaged,” Brengel said. “But this is unsustainable and everyone knows it.”\n \n\n   \n  At NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given,  CNN recently reported .\n \n\n   \n  Some of the sources CNN recently spoke to said they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by the Trump administration to quietly gut the Goddard campus during the shutdown — a claim a NASA spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA   engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.”\n \n\n   \n    When will employees receive back pay?\n \n\n   \n  When the  roughly 1.4 million federal workers  who have been furloughed or working without pay will receive their back pay may vary by agency. Many have  missed  two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, it only took a few   business days for workers to   be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left   amid the administration’s downsizing efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the complexity is that federal workers are not all paid at the same time since the government uses multiple pay systems, said Stier of Partnership for Public Service.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a huge undertaking on top of a lot of other things that the federal employees are going to have to be doing,” he said, though it should take a matter of days, not weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But   “until we get paid, everyone’s going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben   Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\n \n\n   \n    Effects on air travel could linger for years\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown brought chaos to US airports, and the impact   could linger well beyond  the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more   coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n   In May,   the Department of Transportation said   it would replace the decades-old Federal Aviation Administration infrastructure with a new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  At a Wednesday press conference at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said the software and upgrades the new system requires “would take longer than the three-year period,” originally promised.\n \n\n   \n    When will safety net programs be funded?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown wreaked havoc on the  nation’s safety net programs , most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly  42 million Americans  to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  Just when enrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will receive their  full benefits  for November will depend on where they live. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court  paused  a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending  partial benefits  last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month’s aid.\n \n\n   \n  After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. Some, however, could take up to a week to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The spending agreement signed into law takes the threat of another lapse of SNAP off the table in January when another shutdown could occur: The bill funded several agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, for the entire fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n \n\n   \n  It typically takes at least 30 days for the HHS to calculate states’ allocations and get the money out the door for LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

Last week was one of the platform’s busiest weeks in months.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year.\n \n\n   \n  “People want to stick it out as long as they can.

\nUpdated: \n        7:39 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of  Israeli  settlers launched an arson attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian economy ministry on Wednesday called on the international community to take action to stop the attacks. In Tuesday’s incident, perpetrators set fire to four trucks loaded with products from Al-Juneidi, and smashed windows and other property, it said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Anarchist fringe youth’\n \n\n   \n  A senior official from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) condemned the violence. “The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious,” Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth said in a statement shared by the IDF on Wednesday. “It must be dealt with firmly.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued it was unacceptable for “lawbreakers” to “harm property and innocent civilians” while diverting the IDF’s focus “away from its mission of security and counterterrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/homes/portable-mortgages-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00.000Z","title":"The Trump Administration Is 'Actively Evaluating' Portable Mortgages.

What you need to know \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has another idea to make housing more affordable: Let homeowners   take their mortgage rate with them when they move.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating” so-called portable mortgages. The proposal aims to address the housing market’s lack of supply.\n \n\n   \n  The administration   stepped up efforts to address housing affordability this past week. Pulte – who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-backed entities that guarantee more than half of US mortgages – said officials are also weighing  how to make mortgages assumable  and whether to introduce  a new 50-year mortgage option .\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%,  according  to a Redfin analysis of FHFA data. However, average mortgage rates have remained stubbornly stuck between 6% and 7% for the last few years. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates have been less willing to move and potentially pay hundreds more in interest each month on new mortgages at current rates.\n \n\n   \n  Allowing people to keep their lower mortgage rates could encourage them to move and free up supply. But there are questions about how that would work and whether it might wind up actually raising mortgage rates overall, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by CNN, the FHFA did not provide further details about its plans for portable mortgages. In a statement, a spokesperson said the agency was studying a “wide variety of options” to lower housing costs.\n \n\n   \n    How do portable mortgages work?\n \n\n   \n  A portable mortgage allows a borrower to transfer their existing mortgage and mortgage rate to a new property when they move, instead of taking out a brand-new loan.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, imagine a homeowner selling their house for $400,000 with half of that paid off on a 3% mortgage. With a portable mortgage, they could sell their home and transfer the $200,000 left on the loan to the new house, keeping the 3% rate.\n \n\n   \n  Things get trickier if the new home is more expensive. If it costs $450,000, for example, the buyer would need to cover the extra $50,000 either in cash or through a second, smaller loan likely issued at the current higher interest rate.\n \n\n   \n  The hope is that if homeowners could move without losing their low rates, more homes would go up for sale, giving buyers who’ve been locked out a better shot, Wachter said. But the effects on supply would likely be limited, and it might take Congress passing a law to iron out legal wrinkles.\n \n\n   \n    Might this backfire?\n \n\n   \n  Portable mortgages could disrupt the engine powering the US housing market: mortgage-backed securities. Those are essentially bundles of mortgages that banks or lenders sell to investors, which gives the banks the cash they need to issue new loans and keep the mortgage market flowing.\n \n\n   \n  If homeowners can take their loans with them when they move, fewer loans will be paid off early – which means more risk for investors, who might demand higher interest rates to compensate, Wachter said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, mortgage agreements are clear contracts tied to a specific property, with the home’s address listed as collateral. Transferring that loan to a new house would mean effectively rewriting the contract.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s too early to tell what’s going to happen, but it’s going to be a logistical nightmare,” said Justin Demola, the president of Lenders One, a national alliance of mortgage bankers. “All mortgages have a property address, a legal description. How do you get around that as you’re taking the mortgage to the next property?”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the administration considering?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is also looking into a 50-year mortgage, but the proposal  has drawn backlash  from some housing experts. They argue that the monthly savings would be minimal compared to the significantly higher interest costs over the loan’s life versus a standard 30-year fixed mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  The administration also brought up potentially allowing more assumable loans, meaning homebuyers can take over a seller’s existing mortgage and mortgage rate. Most government-backed loans, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, are already assumable. In fact, there are companies that help buyers find homes with assumable mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  However, Demola said he doesn’t see many first-time homebuyers assuming other people’s mortgages, since doing so typically requires a large cash payment or a second mortgage to buy out the existing loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Loans have been assumable forever. You don’t really see many being assumed right now,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-cemetery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Black Soldiers in WWII Removed from U.S. Military Cemetery Spark Controversy","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the winter of 1944, Black U.S. soldiers, including 1st Lt.

Jefferson Wiggins, along with hundreds of other Black soldiers, were tasked with burying the dead in the southern Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  What was once a fruit orchard would become the final resting place for thousands of fallen US service members. It was difficult, gruesome work, done in near-constant rain and snow with only pick axes and shovels. Years later, Wiggins would recall how soldiers under his command in the 960th Quartermaster Service Company cried as they lowered the bodies of men into their graves.\n \n\n   \n  The site, in the village of Margraten located in the southeastern part of the Netherlands, became  one of the largest American military cemeteries  in Europe. And for months, visitors to the cemetery, which is run by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), haven’t been able to learn about the soldiers’ work.\n \n\n   \n  In March, the small, little-known federal agency took down a display from the cemetery’s visitor center that commemorates the contributions of Black soldiers like Wiggins, who ultimately reached the rank of first lieutenant and died in 2013, and highlights the discrimination they faced. Most Black soldiers were limited to non-combat roles during World War II.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a matter of a panel that has my husband’s name on it. That’s not the issue,” Wiggins’ widow, Janice, told CNN. “The issue is that these are a group of men who contributed to their country, who, like almost every soldier during World War II, went through great trauma and bore that for the rest of their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins, who learned of the display’s removal in October from two Dutch filmmakers, said her late husband would “be disappointed, but not shocked.”\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t naive about the world he lived in,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC, which  oversees 26 permanent US military cemeteries , told CNN in a statement that the panel in question was taken down following “an internal review of interpretive content” under the agency’s previous secretary, Charles Djou, and there are currently four other displays highlighting individual African American servicemembers buried at the cemetery.\n \n\n   \n  Djou, a Biden appointee who says he was dismissed by President Donald Trump in April, told CNN in an email the panel’s removal was “done via an internal agency review at the prompting of the Trump administration.” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC said, “The panel was initially added upon request by the former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was determined by the previous secretary, following the internal review in March, that while 1st Lt. Wiggins’ quote represented the immense contributions of many African American service members during the creation of the site, portions of the panels were outside the scope of ABMC’s commemorative mission. There was no external consultation or direction regarding its removal.”\n \n\n   \n  The panel, which was added to an exhibit at the cemetery’s $6.7 million visitor center in 2024, was titled, “African American Servicemembers in WWII: Fighting on Two Fronts.” It described how Black service members, “despite the ongoing fight for civil rights at home during an era of racist policies” enlisted in every military branch and faced “the horrors of war.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins pushed for a panel shortly after the center opened in 2023, when she learned that none of the information or exhibits included any mention of the African American soldiers who buried the dead there. She worked with the former US Ambassador to the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal, and Mieke Kirkels, a Dutch oral historian, and the panel was installed months later.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The stark reality’\n \n\n   \n  Wiggins waited until the late 2000s to revisit the memories of his service, which he would recount to Kirkels for an oral history after learning that he was the last known Black member of his unit alive.\n \n\n   \n  The first person they buried was a young German girl, Wiggins recalled in the oral history  rereleased in 2025 . Her body had been mangled by machine gun fire; her head deformed by a grenade blast. As the Allied forces pressed on, more and more bodies of young American men arrived on trucks for Wiggins and his men to lay to rest. Many had been killed during airborne operations in the east or in the course of advances into German territory.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a permanent arrival of bodies, the whole day long. Sundays included, seven days a week,” Wiggins said. “I find it difficult, even now, to read in the paper that soldiers ‘gave their lives.’ … All those boys in Margraten, their lives were taken away.”\n \n\n   \n  “And here we all were - this group of Black Americans having to deal with these bodies of White Americans,” he said. “The stark reality was we had to bury those soldiers although we couldn’t sit in the same room with them when they were alive.”\n \n\n   \n  For Wiggins, remembering what he saw was a painful, but necessary act. Janice Wiggins said he would often tell her that “people should know.” The contributions of Black soldiers during the war had been frequently overlooked — and in some cases lost forever. A fire at the  National Personnel Records Center  in 1973 destroyed millions of files.\n \n\n   \n  “He never ever wanted the story to be about him. He saw his story as a vehicle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, a sharecropper’s son who had lied about his age to enlist in the military, became a lifelong educator and civil rights activist. He was 87 when he died.\n \n\n   \n    Removal causes local uproar\n \n\n   \n  Theo Bovens, a Dutch politician who leads the  Black Liberators in the Netherlands  project, told CNN that local and regional politicians have asked the ABMC to reinstall the panel, along with another that highlights Technician 4th Class George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier from Camden, New Jersey, who died while trying to save a fellow soldier who had fallen into a river in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC told CNN on Monday that the Pruitt panel is “currently off display, though not out of rotation.” The part of the exhibit featuring Pruitt and other African American servicemembers at the cemetery, the agency said, has panels that were “designed to be removed and rotated.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins told CNN that the “panels were never intended to be part of a traveling exhibit or rotation” and “were intended to be a permanent part of the Visitors Center exhibits.”\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Eijsden-Margraten has formally asked the ABMC to reinstall the panels, insisting that the community values the contributions of Black American soldiers that helped liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis 80 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The governing body of the Limburg Province said it hopes to make a direct appeal to US Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo Jr. who was confirmed in October.\n \n\n   \n  “The displayed panels depicted a history we must never forget, and from which we can learn a great deal—especially now, as global divisions are being increasingly magnified,” the body said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/nfl-week-11-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-05:00","title":"5 Things to Watch in the NFL’s Week 11: Spain Game, Revenge, and MVP Contention","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NFL is expanding globally with its first regular-season game in Spain, where the Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders will play at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, marking Spain as the seventh country outside the U.S. to host an NFL game.

Here are the 5 things to watch in the NFL’s Week 11 \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:30 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The NFL’s passport is getting another stamp, but the drama back home is just as intense.\n \n\n   \n   From revenge games to division battles, here are five things to know heading into Week 11.\n \n\n   \n    NFL heads to Spain\n \n\n   \n  For the first time ever, the NFL is headed to the Spanish capital.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders will square off in Madrid in the league’s first regular-season game in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The historic matchup will take place at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, home of Real Madrid, and will close out this year’s international slate. Spain becomes the seventh country outside the United States to host an NFL regular-season game, joining Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil and Ireland.\n \n\n   \n  So set those alarms early on Sunday – kickoff from Madrid is at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n    Falcons out for revenge\n \n\n   \n  The Atlanta Falcons will have extra motivation Sunday when they host the Carolina Panthers. The last time these two met in Week 3, Carolina rolled to a 30-0 win.\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta has dropped four straight and sits at 3-6. The offense has been brutal, converting just three third downs in its last three games – 3 for 29 in that span. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will need to steady the ship if the Falcons hope to stop the slide.\n \n\n   \n  The good news? Their next three opponents – Panthers, Saints and Jets – are all beatable.\n \n\n   \n    Stafford’s MVP case\n \n\n   \n  Matthew Stafford is on a tear. The Los Angeles Rams quarterback is rewriting the record book, becoming the first in NFL history to throw 20 touchdown passes without an interception over a six-game stretch.\n \n\n   \n  In his last three outings alone, Stafford has tossed 13 touchdowns. He’s now tied with New England’s Drake Maye as a favorite for league MVP.\n \n\n   \n  Another milestone: By beating the 49ers last week, Stafford’s career record finally hit .500 at 115-115-1. After all those rough years in Detroit, that’s no small feat. A win Sunday against the 7-2 Seahawks would give him a winning record for the first time – and first place in the NFC West.\n \n\n   \n     More Mile High Magic? \n \n\n   \n  Every week, the Denver Broncos seem to pull another rabbit out of the hat.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payton’s team has punted more than any team in the league, yet they have won a league-high seven straight and sits atop the AFC West at 8-2.\n \n\n   \n  During this streak, Denver’s margin for error has been razor-thin – wins by 4, 3 (twice), 2 and 1 point.\n \n\n   \n  At some point, the one-score magic runs out… or maybe this team just has it.\n \n\n   \n  But this week’s test is different: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs visit Mile High. The Chiefs are coming off a bye and a loss to Buffalo. History says that’s bad news for Denver – Andy Reid is 22-4 after a bye week.\n \n\n   \n    Lions vs. Eagles in a mega showdown\n \n\n   \n  Sunday Night Football brings a heavyweight NFC clash as the Philadelphia Eagles host the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The defending champs are 7-2, but their fans still feel disrespected. When the stage is big, the Eagles usually deliver – since 2021, they’ve won 10 straight against the Lions, Rams and Packers.\n \n\n   \n  Lions head coach Dan Campbell recently took over play-calling duties, and it paid off immediately with 44 points on Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The Eagles’ defense, though, is a much tougher test. This one could easily be a preview of the NFC Championship Game.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities plan to deport hundreds of sick Palestinian patients, including children with rare conditions and elderly individuals with chronic illnesses, from hospitals in East Jerusalem back to Gaza, despite Gaza’s healthcare system being largely destroyed and nonfunctional.

    \nUpdated: \n        6:32 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Yamen Al-Najjar recalls his past life – the days when he went to school and laughed regularly. Today, the 16-year-old lives with his mother in a cramped 6-square-meter room, just large enough to hold a hospital bed he seldom leaves.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is hard. I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities have decided to send all Gazan patients back home next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen and his mother are among at least 89 Gazan patients and their companions due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization has been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients early next week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT about the potential deportation of sick Palestinians to Gaza but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.”\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been update to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/solar-storm-northern-lights-forecast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:14:00-05:00","title":"Millions saw unexpected northern lights, as a wild solar storm unfolded across the world","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful geomagnetic storm, fueled by two coronal mass ejections merging into a 'cannibal storm' and a third storm arriving at Earth, caused dazzling auroras visible as far south as Florida and the UK.

lights, as a wild solar storm unfolded across the world \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:14 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For two nights, dazzling auroras delighted sky-gazers in unexpected places, including in the US as far south as Florida. The cause: dual solar storms unleashed by the sun reaching Earth.\n \n\n   \n  A severe storm was initially predicted for Thursday as well, with the potential for the northern tier of the US to see auroras again in the evening. Forecasters at the National Weather Service’s  Space Weather Prediction Center  now believe Wednesday night might have been the last opportunity for the most intense conditions.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to creating auroral displays, geomagnetic storms can disrupt   communications, the power grid and satellite operations. The Space Weather Prediction Center said it had otified power grid and satellite operators in the US so they could prepare.\n \n\n   \n  The British Geological Survey initially believed the current solar activity could lead to a G5, or an extreme geomagnetic storm — the highest level on the scale. The survey also dubbed Tuesday’s event a “cannibal storm” that disrupted communications and GPS satellite accuracy.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, two Coronal Mass Ejections lifted off the sun a few hours apart,” the survey’s geomagnetism team explained. “The first one was moving more slowly than the second  …  and so the second one caught up with the first one and they amalgamated together by the time they reached Earth. Hence, the term ‘cannibalised,’ as the second one gobbled up the first one.”\n \n\n   \n  Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in geomagnetic storms.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters at the Space Weather Prediction Center believe that the arrivals of the first two of three anticipated coronal mass ejections caused   Tuesday evening’s auroral display.\n \n\n   \n  “One of them packed a much stronger punch than we would have imagined originally,” said Shawn Dahl, forecaster at the center.\n \n\n   \n  When a storm reaches satellites stationed 1 million miles from Earth, forecasters can measure its speed, the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic orientation, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it pointed opposite Earth, or is it pointed the same as Earth?” Dahl said. “If it turns opposite Earth, then activity really quickly escalates, and those storm levels can dramatically increase very quickly. That’s what happened last night.”\n \n\n   \n  The third solar storm arrived at Earth Wednesday afternoon at 2:17 p.m. ET, with solar wind speeds over 2.1 million miles per hour (950 kilometers per second).\n \n\n   \n  But Earth appears to have been struck by a far flanking edge of the storm, meaning most of the magnetic cloud likely missed our planet, according to an  update from the center .\n \n\n   \n    Solar storm disruptions\n \n\n   \n  Among those feeling the storm’s effects is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The company was  expected to launch  NASA’s  Escapade mission  — twin satellites   set to head on a long journey to Mars — aboard its New Glenn rocket Wednesday. But the increased solar activity blocked that launch attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch,” according to a  post by Blue Origin  on social media platform   X. The company confirmed on X Wednesday evening that another launch attempt is now scheduled for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of activity around our sun   sparked the storms. Three X-class flares, the most intense type of solar flare, have released from the sun this week, followed by a series of coronal mass ejections.\n \n\n   \n  The recent surge in activity stems from an active region of sunspots on the sun called AR 14274, according to Ryan French, a solar physicist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  “AR 14274 still has the potential to produce more X-class solar flares,” French said. “However, the region is now rotating away from us, so any eruptions from future flares are increasingly less likely to hit us as the days pass.”\n \n\n   \n  An X-class flare released Tuesday created a large solar particle storm, the largest since 2005, according to the British Geological Survey. Tuesday’s solar activity also created the largest measured geoelectric field since the survey’s records began in 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field can reach the ground, which triggers electricity in rocks and essentially creates an electric field in the ground. “This is usually tiny on the order of 0.001 Volt per kilometer but during geomagnetic storms it can be much larger,” the survey team noted.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, experts documented a value of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, an unusually large number that “has not been recorded before,” according to the geological survey’s team.\n \n\n   \n  Large geoelectric fields can interfere with transformers and may even cause them to shut down or overheat.\n \n\n   \n    A changing solar cycle\n \n\n   \n  The sun has an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity. Heliophysicists believe the peak, called  solar maximum , occurred in October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we are still in a period of heightened solar activity, we are entering the decay phase of the solar cycle,” French said.   “(Although) sunspots and solar flares are fewer during this time, this is the period where the strongest solar flares typically occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up.\n \n\n   \n  For those in areas   with clear dark skies, keep an eye out for auroras, which could dip over the US. In the UK, sky-gazers in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland had a good chance of seeing them as well, according to the survey.\n \n\n   \n  The last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in  May 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  The storm was a historic one, but fortunately it didn’t reach the level of the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire and remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded.\n \n\n   \n  During the May 2024 geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.\n \n\n   \n  Before May 2024, the last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The recent outburst of activity reminds French of a severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth in  October 2024 . Tuesday night’s storm clocked in as third strongest solar storm of the current solar cycle, French said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/halligan-us-attorney-comey-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Judge Hears Arguments Thursday in Bid by James Comey and Letitia James to Disqualify Lindsey Halligan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James face a critical legal challenge as their defense attorneys argue that Lindsey Halligan, the only federal prosecutor who signed their indictments, is unlawfully serving as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

That period had elapsed by the time Halligan was installed as the interim US attorney for the judicial district in September.\n \n\n   \n  And, Comey’s and James’ defense attorneys say, the clock should not be reset just because a new person was appointed.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers, Comey’s attorneys warned that if the attorney general, who makes the appointments, could do so “back-to-back,” then the “120-day period would be rendered meaningless, and the Attorney General could indefinitely evade the alternate procedures that Congress mandated.”\n \n\n   \n  Under federal law, if the Senate hasn’t confirmed a nominee to serve in the role long-term and the 120-day period has passed, the judges in that judicial district must pick someone to serve in the role. In May, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia picked Erik Siebert, whose time as interim US attorney was coming to a close, to continue serving in the job.\n \n\n   \n   In Comey’s case,  his attorneys further argue that a different prosecutor wouldn’t be able to seek a new indictment against the former FBI director since the five-year statute of limitations in his case has already expired.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has  strongly pushed back , saying in court filings that even if the judge were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether because the indictments don’t “hinge on her validly holding that particular office” of interim US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the department have also claimed that Attorney General Pam Bondi can appoint a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.” But several other judges who have considered similar challenges to US attorneys in other states have rejected that argument in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge to Halligan’s authority is being heard in Alexandria, Virginia, by senior US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton who ordinarily sits in South Carolina. Currie was tapped to handle this part of the two cases given the role the other judges in the Eastern District of Virginia play in ensuring there is a top prosecutor in their district.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  James was charged last month with two counts: bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection to a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia. She has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Both trials are tentatively set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/style/escaramuza-cowgirl-fashion-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Escaramuza, an all-female equestrian sport imported from Mexico to the U.S., has long challenged gender norms in a traditionally male-dominated equestrian culture.

But the job isn’t done \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:56 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What does a cowgirl look like? For some, the question may call forth images of flanneled shirts, Stetson hats and bootcut jeans. But in escaramuza, the all-female equestrian sport imported by the US from Mexico, the answer is a little different.\n \n\n   \n  Before every escaramuza competition, each team lines up to have its uniforms measured. Strict guidelines dictate that the riders’ tiered Victoriana dresses, often vivid in color and trimmed with lace, must be long enough to cover their horses’ haunches. Glitter and beading are prohibited, but any accessories from earrings to brooches must match. Boots, too, should be identical throughout a team. Under each dress is a petticoat layer, as well as a pair of bloomers — both are to be steamed. One missing underlayer can disqualify the entire squad.\n \n\n   \n  Once they have passed their inspection, these spectacularly clad women go on to perform an elaborate synchronized routine while riding side-saddle. Their frothing dresses become fast-moving flurries of pink, purple and sky blue as they gallop across the arena.\n \n\n   \n  Photographer Constance Jaeggi spent the best part of two years traveling across the US to California, Texas, Idaho, Colorado, Oregon and Washington D.C. photographing these women, first for an exhibition at The National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, and later for the upcoming book “ Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home .”\n \n\n   \n  This visual clash — the strong, muscular horse working beneath layers of delicate petticoats — is one beloved by fashion. Dior’s former designer Maria Grazia Chiuri was inspired by the traditional costume of escaramuza, as seen via the brand’s 2019 Cruise runway show; while the September 2025 issue of Vogue, featured self-described horse girls Kendal Jenner and Gigi Hadid atop great steeds in lacy McQueen dresses.\n \n\n   \n  Jaeggi hopes people will come for her vibrant portraits of beautifully dressed women, and stay for a more layered and complex story about feminism, immigration and personal sacrifice. “I think the fashion aspect of it is the easy entry point,” Jaeggi said in a video interview.\n \n\n   \n  Along with taking their photograph, Jaeggi would watch hours of team rehearsals and often ate dinner with her subjects in their home. She interviewed the women and passed along their recorded conversations to Mexican-American writers Ire’ne Lara Silva, the 2023 Texas State Poet Laureate, and Angelina Sáenz, who wrote 15 accompanying poems each in both Spanish and English. The result is a tale of two halves — the calm, predictable waters of Jaeggi’s images, versus a tense storm brewing in the words of the poets.\n \n\n   \n   “When I started researching and speaking to the escaramuza, I realized how important the oral histories were to their story,” she said. Jaeggi was also “hyper aware” of the fact that she isn’t Mexican-American herself. “I don’t have that cultural, personal connection and I felt it was important to make sure that was a major part of the work.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead of visiting the sport’s home country, Jaeggi was instead drawn to the women who were working hard to establish escaramuza in the US. “In Mexico, it really is the sport of the wealthy,” she said. But the performers she met, most of them first or second generation immigrants, told a different story. From bake sales to fund the cost of the extravagant, hand-made dresses for competitions (the gowns cost roughly $300 to $400 each and are imported across the Mexican border) to putting gas in each others cars, the teams Jaeggi met were financially interdependent communities with one shared goal: furthering their athletic craft.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the stories I kept hearing was that it took them years, like a couple of generations, to be able to afford to have horses and to be able to do this sport,” she said. “It made it even more impressive to me, the fact that they dedicate so many of their resources to it.” When discussions moved onto the topic of immigration “there was some hesitance” for women to go on the record, Jaeggi said, because they were undocumented. That was in 2023 — before President Trump’s mission of  mass deportation  and deployment of ICE. “It’s a difficult political climate right now,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout Jaeggi’s book, there is an undercurrent of inequality that regularly bubbles to the surface. Escaramuza is a five- to 10-minute drop in the three-hour ocean of traditional charrería — the exclusively male ranching and horsemanship competition that is also Mexico’s national sport. Charrería was declared as Mexico’s national sport in 1933, though women were only allowed to perform as an entertaining half-time show in 1953. Escaramuza was not recognized as an athletic competitive event until 1992. Even today, the uniforms of male riders are not inspected as rigorously as their female counterparts, Jaeggi notes, a reason she coyly attributes to “interesting gender dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  While the women are eager to maintain their traditions and culture, they feel weighed down by the sport’s strict, essentialist views on gender. It’s a knotty back-and-forth that mostly comes through in writing. “Women/Are second class citizens in this sport,” reads one line of a Sáenz poem, “You are prettier when you are quiet.” In another work, “Machetona,” Silva interprets the struggle of a lesbian teammate who tries to rally against the inherent misogyny of escaramuza. The history of side-saddle, for example, comes from the fear that riding astride risks breaking a woman’s hymen, compromising the evidence of her virginity and, therefore, her value.\n \n\n   \n  “When it came to issues around gender and feminism, and pushing against some of these gender boundaries, I think most women were really willing to talk about it,” Jaeggi said. “They felt like their voices weren’t always heard in their community, and so there was a lot of frustration that was coming out. Those were really great conversations.”\n \n\n   \n  In “The Poetics of Home,” pride and frustration are intermingled in equal parts. But all can agree that an imperfect community is better than none. The “sisterhood,” as escaramuza is often referred to in the book, gives these women purpose, direction and a sense of belonging. “A sisterhood/Born of struggling and dreaming and training,” reads Silva’s poem “Lo Nuestro.” And as much as this sport is rooted in heritage, the women competing today have their sights set on the future. Jaeggi remembers a conversation with an escaramuza rider, who told her that “one of the main reasons she does this sport is she wants little girls, the next generation, to see that as a woman, you too can ride a horse.”\n \n\n   \n  “For a long time within charrería they weren’t,” she said. “The thought of having a woman compete alongside a man, or ride alongside a man on a horse, was unthinkable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/job-prices-debt-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Things are pretty crappy: 1 in 4 U.S. households are living paycheck to paycheck","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article from CNN, published on November 13, 2025, reveals that 24% of U.S. households are living paycheck to paycheck, spending over 95% of their income on essentials.

The bank’s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  They found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the “nice-to-have” things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.\n \n\n   \n     No margin for error \n \n\n   \n  Austin, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said he’s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year – everything from teaching to construction – with no luck.\n \n\n   \n  “To be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to own a house and start a family, but I don’t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Living in two different worlds’ \n \n\n   \n  The Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.\n \n\n   \n  Many are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trump  dismisses affordability concerns  as a “con job” conjured up by Democrats based on “fake” polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  “Higher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,” Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n     A growing wage gap \n \n\n   \n  The problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices – especially now that  inflation has reaccelerated. \n \n\n   \n  After-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That’s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.\n \n\n   \n  Wage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Wadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn’t been this high since 2016.\n \n\n   \n     ‘We’re getting nowhere’ \n \n\n   \n  For Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.\n \n\n   \n  Wages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.\n \n\n   \n  “We work full-time and have degrees. And we’re getting nowhere,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY - Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the “deepening affordability crisis” caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.\n \n\n   \n  For the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.\n \n\n   \n  “This could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,” Daco said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing “risk of labor market deterioration.” The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That’s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.\n \n\n   \n     Subprime auto loan troubles \n \n\n   \n  Some Americans are falling behind on their bills – especially those with low credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least  60 days late on their car loans  climbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  That is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  This trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.\n \n\n   \n  Bank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,” said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.\n \n\n   \n  Vanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn’t make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “The cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven’t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with “astronomical” medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  Jones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,” she said. “They need to walk in our shoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/china-iran-chemical-shipments-congress-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:17:00-04:00","title":"US Lawmakers Demand Answers from Trump Administration Over Chinese Chemical Shipments to Iran","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US lawmakers, including Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, have demanded answers from the Trump administration over reports that Chinese firms are supplying Iran with sodium perchlorate—a key precursor in ballistic missile propellants—since late September 2025.

      \n  By Gianluca Mezzofiore, Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:17 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US lawmakers have called for the Trump administration to respond to reporting that Chinese firms are helping Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program in defiance of United Nations sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The call, from Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, follows  CNN reporting last month  detailing what Western intelligence sources said were several shipments of sodium perchlorate, a missile propellant precursor, from China to Iran since the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  These shipments are “indispensable to Tehran’s efforts to rebuild its ballistic missile arsenal following its  12-day war with Israel  last summer,” the congressmen wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s support for Tehran’s rearmament is deeply concerning and provides yet another example of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) willingness to abet authoritarian aggression from Europe to the Middle East,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN’s reporting, European intelligence sources say 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas between late September and mid-October. The chemicals were bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers, the sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries, which analysts say could provide enough chemical for roughly 500 ballistic missiles, appear to show Iran is stepping up the rebuilding of its missile program, which was depleted by the conflict with Israel in June.\n \n\n   \n  They also come as there has been increased concern in Washington about  potential emerging coordination  between China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last month  for talks that resulted in an economic truce de-escalating their trade war.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s latest shipments of these critical chemical precursors indicate that US actions to date have failed to deter it from supporting Tehran’s procurement of offensive military capabilities,” Krishnamoorthi, who is the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, and Courtney, ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, wrote in their letter.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s support “not only increases Iran’s threat to its neighbors but also assists Russia and pro-Iranian proxy groups like the Houthis whose missile programs Iran has previously supported,” the Congressmen said.\n \n\n   \n  The shipments also “contravene sanctions the United Nations reinstated in September that prohibit international support for Iran’s ballistic missile program and development of nuclear weapons delivery systems,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  Krishnamoorthi and Courtney called for the Trump administration to explain what actions it was taking to “respond to the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) continuing support to Iran’s ballistic missile program,” including in coordination with US allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in April  announced  sanctions on a dozen entities and individuals based in Iran and China for their role procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions on Tehran were restored by a so-called snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms.\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n    China and Iran\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the UN sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue,” and may not see it bound by those rules, as such.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a question from CNN last month about the recent shipments, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while he “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporting last month followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew.\n \n\n   \n  Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had  previously been reported , and entities in China,  long a diplomatic and economic ally  of Iran, are also known to use a network of vessels to filter US-sanctioned Iranian oil to the country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/thailand-cambodia-border-clashes-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"1112-12-11","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00-11:29","title":"Trump’s Thailand-Cambodia peace agreement is falling apart after Cambodian villager killed in fresh clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump and signed in late October 2025, is collapsing after a violent border clash on November 12, 2025.

Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Kuala Lumpur in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Thai soldiers opened fire on civilians in a border village in its northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, killing one person and wounding three others.\n \n\n   \n  The Thai military opened fire at 3:50 p.m. and again some two hours later, ministry spokesperson Lt Gen. Maly Socheata said in a statement.  Cambodia accused Thailand of carrying out “provocative actions over the past few days with the intention of inciting clashes,” in violation of the peace declaration.\n \n\n   \n  The same village, which both sides claim, was the site of a confrontation in September between Thai security personnel and Cambodian villagers. Thai police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to suppress protesters, according to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Contradicting the Cambodian version of events, a Thai army spokesperson said Cambodian troops had opened fire toward the Thai side in its eastern Sa Kaeo province at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thai troops took cover and fired warning shots toward the direction of the gunfire in accordance with the rules of engagement,” army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suwaree said.\n \n\n   \n  There were no Thai casualties or injuries and the incident lasted about 10 minutes, Winthai added.\n \n\n   \n  The clash came after Thailand on Monday said it was “halting all agreements” with Cambodia and would explain its decision to Washington after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand. Thailand accused Cambodia of planting fresh landmines, a claim the Cambodian government denied.\n \n\n   \n  Though Wednesday’s clash was brief, it marked a significant reignition of hostilities after Bangkok and Phnom Penh’s peace declaration that included commitments from both sides to de-escalate tensions, withdraw heavy weapons from the border, and conduct de-mining efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he “strongly condemns” the latest clash as an act against international law, and called for an independent investigation into the incident.\n \n\n   \n  “I call on the Thai side to immediately cease the use of force against innocent Cambodian civilians,” Hun Manet said in a Facebook post, adding that Cambodia remains committed to the ceasefire agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought over their disputed border for decades, but the fighting in July was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the border flare-up.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border, and the territorial dispute over demarcated portions of it largely stems from a map drawn up by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony, which Thailand does not accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/house-vote-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00Z","title":"How Each House Member Voted on Ending the Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives voted to end a record-setting government shutdown by approving a Senate-backed funding bill, with a final tally of 222–209 votes.

The lawsuit alleged they forced her to become a “sex slave” to powerful men – including a royal prince later revealed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Mountbatten-Windsor, who  has been stripped of his prince title , has denied the allegation and  later settled a lawsuit  Giuffre filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  In several email exchanges on January 10, 2015, after the lawsuit was filed, Epstein and Maxwell coordinated their public response to the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Initial response, too many unanswered question [sic] raised, relationship with jeffrey/…I am writing to writin [sic] to respond to alleagtinoin [sic] that have been made wchich [sic] are categorically untrue,” Epstein wrote Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded by asking if her lawyer could speak with a lawyer, then wrote: “I have to distance myself from you in statement too.

I needs it asap.”\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein assured Maxwell he was on the phone with his lawyer about getting her a lawyer, she replied, “I need it written out in full.”\n \n\n   \n  “Call me,” Epstein replied.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell later  settled  a defamation lawsuit with Giuffre in June 2017 for an undisclosed sum.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the Justice Department this summer, Maxwell said her relationship with Epstein was  “almost nonexistent”  between 2010 and 2019 outside of corresponding over legal matters.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and a former Obama official\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In a March 24, 2018, email chain with  Kathryn   Ruemmler , a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein  shared  a Daily Beast article titled, “How Close Is Donald Trump to a Psychiatric Breakdown?”\n \n\n   \n  The exchange shows Epstein forwarding the story early that morning to Ruemmler, with her replying: “Not confidence inspiring.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein then responded: “but – accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  A year earlier in July 2017, Ruemmler wrote an email to Epstein saying, “Trump is truly stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  “Duh,” Epstein replied several hours later.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler and Epstein were corresponding at the time.\n \n\n   \n  But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   \n  Ruemmler did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2018, Epstein emailed Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior, writing:\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power. tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Epstein forwarded the same comment to Reid Weingarten, an  attorney  who worked for him.\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten replied that Trump was “starting to behave very erratically.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back: “borderline insane. and corroborated by some that are close.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein questioned whether Trump had ‘early dementia’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In early January 2018, as questions swirled about Trump’s behavior  following the release  of Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury,” Epstein exchanged a series of emails with a reporter at The New York Times discussing the president’s mental state.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the reporter an  excerpt  of the book that ran in New York Magazine.\n \n\n   \n  The reporter remarked that Trump was “looking/sounding increasingly unhinged,” Epstein replies, “no questions donalds statement is goofy. . early dementia?”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed then-Prince Andrew: ‘you ok?’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kara Scannell \n \n\n   \n  In March 2011, as the Epstein scandal was picked up by British tabloids focusing on then-Prince Andrew’s involvement, Epstein reached out to Andrew to ask how he was doing.\n \n\n   \n  “you ok?” Epstein wrote to an email identified as “The Duke,” an apparent reference to Andrew, known at the time as the Duke of York. “these stories are complete ant (sic) utter fantasy.”\n \n\n   \n  King Charles stripped Andrew of his prince title last month and forced him to move out of the royal residence. Andrew  relinquished his title  as Duke of York weeks beforehand.\n \n\n   \n    Jeffrey Epstein in 2018: ‘I know how dirty Donald is’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein wrote that, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the message on August 23, 2018, after Trump’s longtime fixer Michael Cohen  pleaded guilty  to federal campaign finances crimes. As part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors, Cohen  implicated Trump  in a 2016 hush-money scheme involving payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair, which Trump denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You see, I know how dirty Donald is,” Epstein wrote in the email. “My guess is that non-lawyers NY biz people have no idea what it means to have your fixer flip.”\n \n\n   \n  The email conversation began when Ruemmler sent Epstein a  New York Times column  about the Cohen guilty plea and what it might mean for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Her email said, “The principled case for impeachment is clear. What’s missing is the courage,” quoting the column.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was not impeached and he never faced any federal charges over the matter despite a  lengthy investigation . However, the Manhattan district attorney later won an indictment of Trump on state charges in connection with the matter.  Trump was convicted  last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payments.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein corresponded with Steve Bannon about then-Prince Andrew and Trump\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In early June 2019, President Trump made a state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was welcomed by the former Prince Andrew. A  photo shows Andrew grinning  as he shakes Trump’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  In a June 2019 email exchange with Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Jeffrey Epstein wrote, “prince andrew and trump today.. Tooo [sic] funny.” And then he added, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago [sic].”\n \n\n   \n  Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u [sic] the connective tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly Bannon meant by the message. Trump  fired him from the White House  in 2017, though Bannon remained influential in conservative politics as he does today.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Andrew  socialized together  in the 1990s and 2000s, per newspaper reports, alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sometimes at Mar-A-Lago. King Charles  stripped Andrew of his prince title  in October.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Bannon for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein said he ‘gave’ his young girlfriend to Trump in the 1990s. Trump has denied wrongdoing\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Aaron Blake \n \n\n   \n  Many of the exchanges from the emails feature people implying Epstein had damaging information about Trump and suggesting that he go public with it.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein generally didn’t engage with these suggestions. But at one point in late 2015, he told a New York Times reporter that he could produce “photos [sic] of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  Later in the same email string, Epstein also alluded to a woman he claimed both he and Trump had dated in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  “my 20 year old girlfriend in 1993, , that after two years i gave to donald,” Epstein said, linking to a webpage featuring the woman.\n \n\n   \n  A previously published lewd 2003 birthday album for Epstein’s 50th birthday alluded to a similar situation. It included a joke about Epstein having  sold “a ‘fully depreciated’ woman to Donald Trump.” \n \n\n   \n  Trump says the documents are a “hoax” and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-trump-emails-boebert-mace-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump is getting pulled deeper and deeper into the Epstein drama","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how new emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, released by the House Oversight Committee, have intensified the political scandal involving Donald Trump.

pulled deeper and deeper into the Epstein drama \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:57 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Jeffrey Epstein saga has a dastardly quality: The more anyone drawn into the morass tries to dig themselves out, the deeper they dig themselves in.\n \n\n   \n  The White House proved the rule yet again on Wednesday, on a shocking day of revelations in Washington over  Epstein emails  that mentioned Donald Trump multiple times and darkened a broadening shadow over his presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The question at the heart of a political drama that grew out of the profound tragedy of scores of young women trafficked and abused by Epstein is now becoming impossible for the president to suppress.\n \n\n   \n  Why is he so adamant that Americans must not see files related to a  onetime friend  he later denounced, even though there’s been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on his own part?\n \n\n   \n  A dizzying day of political intrigue Wednesday crushed Republican hopes of claiming the end of the  longest government shutdown on record  as an eye-catching win. It opened when House Oversight Committee Democrats  released three emails  newly acquired from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump. This was soon followed by a torrent of other emails, some referencing the president, from the GOP-led panel.\n \n\n   \n  It did not immediately appear that the trove of material created any new legal issues for Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it proved “absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But the explosive content — which included Epstein and his now-jailed accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell discussing Trump — was the kind of gossipy jet fuel that can ensure scandals defy all attempts at containment and significantly worsened Trump’s political predicament on the issue. It was also the latest twist in a story with an extraordinary capacity to tarnish reputations, which, unlike its main protagonist, will not die.\n \n\n   \n  Political earthquakes are now rumbling on both sides of the Atlantic. Washington is on scandal alert. In the UK, the aftershocks just led to the  defenestration of a prince  — Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — and the  dismissal of a lord  as ambassador to Washington — Peter Mandelson — both over their past friendships with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Most seriously for the president, Wednesday’s disclosures raised questions over whether he’s been fully transparent about what he knew about Epstein — a former fellow New York and Florida resident, who killed himself in prison in 2019. At the least, the emails implied Trump knew more than he’s been prepared to let on about a wealthy convicted pedophile who moved in the highest society circles alongside powerful men in New York and London.\n \n\n   \n  In one email on April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight Committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. They accused Democrats of hiding her name because she did not allege Trump did something wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in an interview this year that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Other material was embarrassing for Trump. Epstein called him “borderline insane” in  a 2018 email exchange  with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. In another email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017, a week after Trump signed an executive order banning the entry of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, Epstein said, “Donald is f**king crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  A year later, Epstein wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about him, in an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Epstein also emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and Ruemmler in March 2018.\n \n\n   \n    An overbearing White House response makes the political drama worse\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein saga has dogged Trump for months. He’s tried and failed to shut it down, for instance when he lashed out in a Cabinet meeting in July, telling a reporter he didn’t know why people were still talking “about this guy, this creep.”\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the latest focus on the Epstein affair has underscored why the Justice Department makes it a practice not to release investigative files when prosecutions are not deemed appropriate. Disclosures can harm the reputations of those involved when they are not charged or accused of wrongdoing, or are merely witnesses who provided testimony or were mentioned in evidence.\n \n\n   \n  But incredibly, the latest political ramifications of the Epstein affair were triggered by administration officials themselves, with Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi pledging to release files before going back on their word. That has created the frenzy of speculation over what is contained in the full record of the case.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s left Trump accused of a classic Washington cover-up. As Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw put it in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. “It would make a lot more sense for him to just say, ‘Let’s release the full files and get it all out there and get it all over with.’”\n \n\n   \n  Walkinshaw went on: “Why doesn’t he want to do that? What’s in those files that he wants to allow this drip, drip, drip of bad news to continue?”\n \n\n   \n  Despite new denials of wrongdoing by Trump and his aides, Wednesday’s releases set off the latest overbearing, and frankly strange, effort by officials to quell the drama. In an extraordinary meeting exclusively reported by CNN, top officials met a single lawmaker, Rep. Lauren Boebert, in  the White House Situation Room , a venue fabled for its use in national security crises. Multiple sources said before the meeting that a heavyweight line-up of Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was expected.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting raised the question of whether the White House hoped to get the Colorado lawmaker to pull her name from a petition that will force GOP House leaders to  allow a vote  on releasing investigative files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Boebert later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  It was another stunning twist in a saga that makes the White House look not just clumsy but as if it is trying to orchestrate a cover-up, even as Trump’s aides insist there is nothing to hide.\n \n\n   \n  The Situation Room meeting was just the latest bizarre intervention by Trump’s aides in the Epstein case. In July, Blanche traveled to interview Maxwell, and the Justice Department later released the transcript and tape of her saying that the president had never at any time behaved inappropriately. Shortly afterward, Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, was moved to a far less draconian prison.\n \n\n   \n  Underlining the failure of the latest White House damage-control effort, GOP Rep. Nancy Mace confirmed to CNN’s Jake Tapper that she did not intend to try to remove her name from the discharge petition. “I will never turn my back on other survivors,” she wrote in a text message. “The work is too important. No one believes us. And we never get justice.” The petition got its pivotal signature on Wednesday with the  swearing-in of a newly elected Democratic lawmaker , which had been delayed for weeks by Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n    How can Trump tamp down the controversy?\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s drama was precipitated by the return of the House for the first time since mid-September. The immediate focus on Epstein seemed to reinforce a claim by Johnson’s critics that one of his aims in keeping lawmakers at home during the shutdown was to tamp down the Epstein storm. If that was the case, he only made it worse. The speaker had no choice but to announce that the House next week will vote, against the wishes of the White House, on a resolution requiring the Department of Justice to release files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  One question now is how on earth does Trump — whose  approval ratings  are already dipping fast, and who is struggling to empathize with a wave of economic anxiety rippling across the country — ever make all of this go away?\n \n\n   \n  Time and again, the president’s achievements have been overshadowed by the return of the Epstein case. While it is not clear that this is an issue that will decide many votes in the 2026 midterm elections, it’s a constant distraction for the White House. Questions about Trump’s character and past did not stop him twice winning the presidency. But the Epstein issue is a rare controversy that has caused a backlash with his base, even though there’s no sign yet that it will sever his almost mythical bond with his most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  But on this question, at least, he’s failed to pull the GOP into line. He made increasingly frantic efforts on social media to portray the email releases as all part of a Democratic plot. His efforts failed. Now, the number of Republican lawmakers who back the release of the documents will be closely watched.\n \n\n   \n  Any large-scale Republican revolt against the president in the House vote could be latest sign that his impregnable support from the GOP on Capitol Hill is beginning to crumble, following the failure of his demands on Republican senators to remove the filibuster rule in their chamber, which frustrated him during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And a strong vote from Republicans to release the files might also heap more pressure on Republicans in the Senate to vote for disclosure. “I’ve already had a couple Republicans tell my office privately that they’re going to vote for it, and I think that could snowball,” Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has braved fierce pressure from the White House, told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n \n\n   \n  In another sign of growing tensions in the House, another Republican, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee launched an unsuccessful bid to force the release of all the Epstein files immediately. “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” Burchett said.\n \n\n   \n  This was the latest indication, that, in Epstein’s words, the “dog that hasn’t barked” over his association with Trump is barking now. Everyone in Washington and around the globe can hear it. And ominously for Trump, the White House seems to have no idea how it can be silenced.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/government-shutdown-funding-bill-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:16:00-04:00","title":"President Trump signs bill to reopen government, ending longest shutdown in US history","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan funding bill ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted 43 days and resulted in massive layoffs.

government, ending longest shutdown in US history \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Adam Cancryn, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:16 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed a funding package to  reopen the federal government , officially bringing a close to the longest shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  The final approval came hours after the House voted 222 to 209 to pass a deal struck between Republicans and centrist Senate Democrats that keeps the government running through January and ensures some key agencies will be funded for the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement, which ended a record 43-day stalemate in Congress, will also reverse the mass federal layoffs carried out by Trump during the shutdown. It paves the way for paychecks to flow to government employees, as well as the resumption of critical food and nutrition services relied on by tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday night cast the legislation as a victory over Democrats, calling it “a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was, they tried to extort.”\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t want to do it the easy way,” he said from the Oval Office, attacking what he called “the extremists” in the Democratic Party. “They had to do it the hard way, and they look very bad.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House signing ceremony was attended by a range of Republican lawmakers and capped a four-day sprint to pass the funding bill, after eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to compromise with Republicans amid worries about the shutdown’s widening economic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  The deal guarantees an early December vote in the Senate on the expiring Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made the focus of their demands during the shutdown fight. But a vote to extend the subsidies is unlikely to succeed, a likelihood that’s driven intense blowback across the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  Most congressional Democrats loudly protested the bill in the run-up to Wednesday’s vote over concerns Americans’ health care premiums will skyrocket without the subsidies, with only six House Democrats voting in favor of the package.\n \n\n   \n  “This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote. “Tens of millions of Americans are at risk of being unable to afford to go see a doctor when they need it.”\n \n\n   \n  Back in Washington for the first time since mid-September, Speaker Mike Johnson corralled almost all Republicans behind the bill, despite sharp complaints from some of his members over a contentious provision added by Senate Republicans that allowed senators to retroactively sue the Department of Justice for obtaining phone records during a Biden-era probe – potentially amounting to a major financial windfall for those lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson himself said he was blindsided by the language, and he said he didn’t know about it until the Senate had already passed the package.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked by it, I was angry about it,” the speaker said, though he added that he did not believe Senate Majority Leader John Thune added it in a nefarious manner. “I think it was a really bad look, and we’re going to fix it in the House.”\n \n\n   \n  To win over conservative holdouts, Johnson vowed that the House would take a future vote to strip that language — though it’s unclear if the Senate would take it up. Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas ultimately agreed not to amend the language in the current stopgap bill, since it would require the Senate to return to Washington to vote again and delay the end of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Conservatives like Roy had blasted that provision as “self-dealing,” since it would award senators $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their lawsuit is successful. The amendment appeared to benefit eight senators in particular who had been subpoenaed by the previous administration into investigations into Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, accused those eight senators of voting “to shove taxpayer dollars into their own pockets – $500,000 for each time their records were inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  The House Democrats who voted in favor of the compromise bill to reopen the government were: Reps. Jared Golden, Adam Gray, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Henry Cuellar, Tom Suozzi and Don Davis. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie voted and Greg Steube against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The end of the government shutdown will usher in a frenetic few weeks of work for the House, which has been largely shuttered since late September. As part of the GOP’s pressure campaign on Democrats, Johnson had decided to keep all members out of Washington until Senate Democrats agreed to back the GOP’s existing funding plan.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Republicans and Democrats have just four weeks in session before the end of the year — when those Obamacare tax credits expire. Trump has called for revamping the law rather than extending the existing subsidies, setting up a high-stakes showdown over health care that could carry political ramifications for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Obamacare was a disaster,” Trump said Wednesday night. “We’ll work on something having to do with health care. We can do a lot better.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are plenty of other deadlines, including Congress’ farm bill and a slew of expiring energy credits. \n \n\n   \n  House Republicans are also eager to pass as many spending bills as possible to improve their negotiating stance with the Senate ahead of that next deadline on January 30.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson also faces another hot-button issue: the question of how Congress should handle the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  Not long before the votes to reopen the government got underway, a newly elected Democrat — Rep. Adelita Grijalva — became the critical 218th signature to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release all of its case files related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson announced to reporters soon after Grijalva signed the petition that he will put a bill compelling the Department of Justice to release all of its Epstein case files on the House floor next week – earlier than expected, and after an extraordinary White House pressure campaign earlier Wednesday failed to convince any Republicans to remove their name from the petition.\n \n\n   \n  The effort coincided with intensifying scrutiny over the Epstein files in the House. Earlier Wednesday, House Democrats on the Oversight panel released  new emails that  showed Epstein had repeatedly mentioned Trump by name in private correspondence, and then the GOP-led committee released 200,000 pages of documents the panel received from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/americas/venezuela-us-aircraft-carrier-reaction-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00-05:00","title":"Venezuelans voice uncertainty, fear and skepticism after arrival of US aircraft carrier in region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The arrival of the U.S. USS Gerald R.

They may have lost much of their inland habitat due to encroaching dryland, a situation compounded by growing competition with other predators and the dwindling amount of prey, said co-author Michael Stein, a research associate at the University of New South Wales.\n \n\n   \n    A backyard trove\n \n\n   \n  The exact location of the discovery is a small town called Murgon, about three and a half hours’ drive from Brisbane, the capital of Queensland.\n \n\n   \n  Archer said he and his colleagues had been excavating there since 1983, and he could still recall how it all began.\n \n\n   \n  “UNSW colleague Henk Godhelp and I drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The residents “grinned and said ‘of course’” after hearing their homes were sitting on some prehistoric treasures, Archer recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we’ve already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s inherently difficult to identify an extinct species based on   an eggshell, said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist and author of “ The Secret Lives of Dinosaurs  — Unearthing the  Real  Behaviors of Prehistoric Animals.” He wasn’t involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, given that the eggshell was found in the same geological deposits and locality of the only known mekosuchine fossils from that period of time, Lomax said the authors made a solid argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of the key things here is that matching the fossil egg shells and the croc that laid them can provide new information,” he said. “It will help us to understand not only how they reproduced and where they laid their eggs, but the connection may help shed light on the lifestyle of these unusual crocs.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-discharge-petition-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:38:00-05:00","title":"The Epstein Files Petition Now Has Its 218th Signature.

What happens next? \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Adelita Grijalva’s swearing in on Wednesday made her Democrats’ newest member in the US House of Representatives and officially set in motion lawmakers’ effort to force a vote on a measure the White House has fought for months: a bill to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n  After her formal swearing in, Grijalva provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  As a refresher, a discharge petition is a critical tool at rank-and-file members’ disposal. Under the arcane procedure, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign one, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joined with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to spearhead this particular discharge petition, but while Grijalva provided the decisive signature, the effort faces a number of hurdles — and the bill is unlikely to become law.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, should it pass the House, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump, who has derided the effort. But the House vote would put lawmakers on the record on the issue, forcing Republicans in particular to choose between siding with Trump or backing the release of files that could shine new light on the crimes of the convicted sex offender.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the steps the House will have to take now that Grijalva has become the 218th signature:\n \n\n   \n    How long does it take to ‘ripen’?\n \n\n   \n  Even with Grijalva’s signature, an additional seven legislative days have to lapse before a member can move to bring the petition to the floor. The week is often referred to as the “ripening” period.\n \n\n   \n  Then, House Speaker Mike Johnson has up to two legislative days to schedule a vote. (But again, calendar days don’t always equal legislative days – the House must be in session.)\n \n\n   \n  That appeared to make the first week of December the earliest the House could actually begin considering a vote to release the Epstein files on the House floor. But in a surprise, Johnson said early Wednesday evening he’d put the measure on the floor next week. As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up to the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n    Can GOP leadership delay or dodge the effort?\n \n\n   \n  If he wanted to, Johnson does have a few maneuvers at his disposal to try to delay or derail the process, including an attempt to table a final vote on the matter or referring it to a committee. But Johnson’s saying the bill will come to the floor next week shows that he wants to bring this up for a vote.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker has previously indicated that if the petition gets 218 signatures, he will allow for a vote. “If they get their signatures, it goes to a vote,” Johnson told reporters last month.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson also called the effort a “moot point” on CNN earlier this week, citing the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein-related investigation and release of thousands of pages of documents.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming the process moves forward, the House would then have to take a series of procedural votes with hours of debate on the House floor before the bill would receive a final vote.\n \n\n   \n  And then, after all that, the bill would still need to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate – a dubious prospect – where 60 votes would be needed for it to advance, if it even got a vote.\n \n\n   \n    Will the Senate consider the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Even if Massie’s bill clears the House, there’s no guarantee it would get a vote in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether the Senate should vote on the bill, the Republican leader said he was “not sure what that achieves.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to force a vote in September on a bill calling for the release of the files, but Senate Republicans killed the measure — with all but two Republicans voting to derail it.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:12:00-05:00","title":"Johnson says House will vote next week on push to compel DOJ to release all of its Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the U.S. House of Representatives will vote next week on a discharge petition introduced by Reps.

release of all of the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein case files to a vote on the House floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said, adding, “in the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson was required to soon put the bill from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, on the floor after the pair  successfully deployed an arcane tool  in the chamber known as a discharge petition. But he had some leeway to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leaders’ suggestion that he would move more quickly than expected to put the bill before the full House is a reflection of the growing sense of agitation among members of his party on Capitol Hill. The House GOP – which is fiercely loyal to Trump – is not eager to take the vote, which goes against the president’s own wishes. But many members of the party are also sick of the months of growing pressure from some vocal members of their own party, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and feel they need to vote in favor of releasing the files or risk being accused of protecting pedophiles.\n \n\n   \n  “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” a frustrated Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters after he went rogue earlier in the day, taking to the House floor to try to force an expedited vote on the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m tired of messing around. The Democrats have had the Epstein files for four years, and now we’ve got it for nine months, and it’s going to be dragged into a bunch of nonsense. Let’s just take it to the floor. Let’s vote on it. Let’s get on with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The congressman’s push was denied because it did not follow the proper parliamentary procedure.\n \n\n   \n  Political pressure over that high-profile Epstein vote roared back to life on the Hill Wednesday, with House members return to Washington after more than a month away.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva’s afternoon swearing in as the House’s newest member delivered the decisive vote to the discharge petition to force a vote, despite GOP leadership’s opposition and an apparent eleventh-hour  pressure campaign  by the White House to avoid it altogether.\n \n\n   \n  As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up on the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require. But Massie and Khanna used the discharge petition because House GOP leadership did not want the bill to get a vote – leaving many expecting they would have to wait seven legislative days to circumvent leadership and come to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  While the floor schedule for next week has not yet been set, Johnson said leadership wants to bring up the measure “as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it. I mean, they have 218 signatures, that’s fine, we’ll do it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The House Committee on Oversight Committee on Wednesday released an additional 20,000 pages of documents the GOP-led panel had received from the late convicted sex offender’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In emails released as part of the tranche, Epstein, whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence over the last 15 years with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit – details seized on by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, however, brushed aside the  newly public details  when asked about them earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a massive distraction by the Democrats while we’re trying to get the government reopened and cover for their mistakes. I find it interesting that the press corps didn’t ask all these questions for four years during the Biden administration,” Johnson said, when asked whether he had any concerns about the new findings.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed by CNN why Congress shouldn’t release all Epstein documents when the president himself has said he supports doing so, Johnson said: “He is for maximum transparency. He said it as recently as a couple of days ago, and I talked to him about it today. He’s for everything coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Epstein-related pressure builds, two more House Republicans — GOP Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Eli Crane of Arizona — said they plan to vote for the bill to release the files when it comes to the floor. Neither had signed the discharge petition.\n \n\n   \n  Other Republicans, however, remain staunchly opposed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a vote against,” Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “My understanding and I’ve looked into it extensively is that the president didn’t like that guy, he had no friendly relationships with him.

Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal government shutdown provided  President Donald Trump  a weekslong reprieve from major revelations about his relationship with  Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  But as Congress looks to reopen the government this week, it’s clear Trump’s Epstein problem hasn’t gone away.\n \n\n   \n  The big news Wednesday morning was that House Oversight Committee Democrats released  three emails obtained from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump . Those emails came amid another huge release from the GOP-led committee of Epstein documents that  CNN is still reviewing .\n \n\n   \n  In one 2011 email, Epstein describes Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” He writes that someone who Democrats identify as an Epstein victim (but whose name is redacted in the released email) “spent hours at my house with him,” apparently referring to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans on the committee have since said the redacted victim who supposedly spent time with Trump  is Virginia Giuffre , one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. (Giuffre never implicated Trump in any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2019 email, Epstein appears to reflect on Trump asking Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to stop recruiting employees from Mar-a-Lago. In the email, Epstein says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2015 email, Epstein writes to author Michael Wolff about how Trump might handle questions about his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  (You can  see the emails for yourself here .)\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The White House on Wednesday said the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But what do these emails add to our understanding of their past relationship? Let’s break it down.\n \n\n   \n    Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and when\n \n\n   \n  There have remained huge unanswered questions about  what Trump knew and when about Epstein’s proclivities . That’s especially given Trump’s explanations have often  proved evasive or false .\n \n\n   \n  The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had “selectively leaked” the emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.\n \n\n   \n  To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein  liked women “on the younger side.”  A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein “ going after younger girls ” at a 1992 “calendar girl” event. Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein’s “swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls” and joking that it was nice of Epstein to “ let the neighborhood kids use his pool .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a “creep” — but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees, including Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago — but he seemed to be  quite reluctant to go into detail .\n \n\n   \n  The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being  recruited for .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he didn’t “know really why” Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation — and was aware of Epstein’s taste for young females — that would seem to raise red flags.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal actions,” Giuffre’s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in  a statement  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre “spent hours” at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell’s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn’t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein’s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump’s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s clear from Giuffre’s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends. “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,” Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses “next to the resort” who needed babysitting for their kids.\n \n\n   \n    The emails undercut Maxwell’s attempts to distance Trump from Epstein\n \n\n   \n  The Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so  despite  her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.\n \n\n   \n  (Trump at the time hadn’t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn’t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn’t explained how this happened, months later.)\n \n\n   \n  And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president.  She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But the new emails call her claims into question.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of Trump’s and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: “I don’t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of — I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.”\n \n\n   \n  But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein’s house, at least as of 2011.\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending “hours at my house” with Trump, Maxwell responds, “I have been thinking about that.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been  called into question .\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significant\n \n\n   \n  We surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There’s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  The timelines are important here.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein’s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently  stripped of his noble title .) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein  seemed to be going into legal attack mode .\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein’s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, Epstein described Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” This is an expression that comes from   Sherlock Holmes mysteries ; it basically means the absence of an expected event.\n \n\n   \n  Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected  news about Trump to have come out?\n \n\n   \n  (Years later, in June 2019, Epstein seemed willing to laugh about it in an email exchange with a redacted individual, who a source confirmed is Trump’s former White House strategist Steve Bannon. Epstein described a meeting between then-President Trump and Prince Andrew at a state visit as “Tooo funny,” adding, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago.” Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u the connective tissue.“)\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of the 2019 email about Trump and Maxwell is also relevant. That’s because it came during Trump’s first term as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump’s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ’s inspector general  said on January 30  of that year that he didn’t have the power to examine the situation. But  by February 6  the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors  as of early that year .\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump “of course” being aware of Maxwell’s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategize about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)\n \n\n   \n  In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to “let him hang himself” by denying being on Epstein’s plane or his house.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I know how dirty Donald is’: Several suggestions about what Epstein knew about Trump\n \n\n   \n  The newly released documents don’t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump’s possible impeachment: “you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.” (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about “the stories you could tell,” according to one of the released email exchanges. After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was “a phony rich person.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos “of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  He also told the person that he at one point “gave” his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.\n \n\n   \n  At other points in Epstein’s correspondence, Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,” Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. “Interested?”\n \n\n   \n    Trump is still feeding perceptions of a cover-up\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s reactions to the new documents Wednesday aren’t going to do anything to tamp down perceptions that Trump is trying to keep stuff like this hidden.\n \n\n   \n  CNN exclusively  reported  that the White House held a Situation Room meeting Wednesday with a key GOP lawmaker who’s signed onto an effort to force a House vote on releasing the full Epstein files, using what’s known as a  discharge petition  – something the White House wants to stop.\n \n\n   \n  That petition got a decisive 218th signature Wednesday from a new Democratic member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP lawmaker, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, later thanked White House officials for meeting with her in a post on X, writing, “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is also reporting Trump has  played phone tag  with another of the four Republican signatories, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. (She later said in a statement, “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”)\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s response to Oversight Democrats releasing emails that mention him was to publicly pressure Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap” on Epstein, Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else …”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional takeaways.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-administration-meeting-house-effort-epstein-document-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00Z","title":"Exclusive: Trump administration holds Situation Room meeting over House effort to force release of all of DOJ’s Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration convened a Situation Room meeting with Republican Representative Lauren Boebert and other key lawmakers over a growing effort in the U.S. House to force a vote on releasing Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

GOP lawmaker about an effort in the US House to force a vote on releasing Justice Department case files related to Jeffrey Epstein, according to multiple sources familiar with the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the meeting later Wednesday when asked about reporting that administration officials were huddling with GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that show the level of transparency when we are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns?” she told reporters at the press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt added: “I’m not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar confirmed the meeting in the Situation Room included Boebert, who has wanted the Justice Department to release its trove of Epstein files and has signed onto the effort in the House to force the vote compelling their release.\n \n\n   \n  That effort is now in motion after a newly sworn-in Democratic member of Congress provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  After the meeting, Boebert wrote on X, “I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  She later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, President Donald Trump and Rep. Nancy Mace, another Republican who’s signed the petition, had been playing phone tag for the past 24 hours. The South Carolina Republican sent a direct message to the president Wednesday outlining why she’s supporting the discharge petition, according to a source familiar with the message who said it largely mirrored a public statement in which she said: “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”\n \n\n   \n  But both the meeting and Trump’s efforts to talk to Mace underscored the administration’s concerns around the Epstein saga, which roared back Wednesday morning when the House Oversight Committee released more documents it had obtained from Epstein’s estate. (Leavitt said Wednesday the emails from that trove that mention Trump  “prove absolutely nothing.” )\n \n\n   \n  Besides Boebert and Mace, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is the other Republican who’s signed onto the petition from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, to force the vote on the release of the files on the House floor. The pair received the 218th decisive signature from Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva Wednesday afternoon,  allowing the push to force a vote to move forward. \n \n\n   \n  Had anyone removed their name from the petition before reaching 218, Massie and Khanna would have no longer had the support needed to move forward.\n \n\n   \n  Under the arcane procedure of a House discharge petition, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign on, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  The unreleased Justice Department files, which capture years of investigation into child sex trafficking, could include details the House hasn’t obtained.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the White House meeting, one source said it would also include Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi was seen leaving the White House at 1:10pm ET on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The controversy around Epstein and his contacts with other powerful people, including Trump, has divided the Republican Party in recent months, with Boebert being among the Republican House members publicly pushing for more transparency around the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any crime, and longtime Epstein contact and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell previously told Blanche in an interview this summer that she had seen no wrongdoing,  including by Trump.  \n \n\n   \n  At least two women who say they are survivors of Epstein’s abuse were expected to attend Grijalva’s swearing-in ceremony Wednesday afternoon, sources with knowledge told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The House effort to compel the release of the files, should it pass, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by Trump, who has derided the effort.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/louisville-ups-plane-crash-victims","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"All 14 Victims Identified from Fiery UPS Cargo Plane Crash in Louisville","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic incident on November 12, 2025, a UPS cargo plane crashed during takeoff at UPS Worldport at Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, killing 14 people.

Their names were released Wednesday as Mayor Craig Greenberg lamented the lives that will “forever be unfinished.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we share the names of those who we’ve lost, our city feels the full weight of this unimaginable tragedy,” Greenberg said at a news conference. “Behind every one of these names is a circle of family, friends, stories that will forever be unfinished.”\n \n\n   \n  Eight days after the plane plowed into the ground in a massive fireball, the local coroner’s office said it completed the grim tasks of recovering victims’ remains, identifying them and notifying their loved ones. Investigators from the  National Transportation Safety Board  remain at the crash site, Greenberg said.\n \n\n   \n  Victims included three pilots on board when the crash happened during takeoff at UPS Worldport, the company’s global aviation hub located at Muhammad Ali International Airport. They were Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.\n \n\n   \n  Dramatic  video  captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball.

The mother of his child, Tifany Torok, said in a GoFundMe account for Spray’s daughter that he “was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”\n \n\n   \n  The family of Louisnes Fedon, 47, said “his death has created a sudden and immense void that goes far beyond emotional grief”; a GoFundMe was set up by a friend of Fedon’s children. Like Spray, relatives say Fedon and his 3-year-old granddaughter, Kimberly Asa, were in the wrong place at the wrong time when the plane crashed to the ground just off the runway.\n \n\n   \n  Matthew Sweets, 37, was severely burned and died days later. He worked as an electrician and had two young children, Cohen and Rayne, according to his obituary.\n \n\n   \n  Another victim, Ella Petty Whorton, 31, was at the recycling business when the crash occurred. Her boyfriend, Eric Richardson, said they worked together collecting scrap metal to help make a living.

Adelita Grijalva is finally sworn in as the House’s newest Democrat, paving way for Epstein files vote \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After 50 days of waiting, Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn into Congress Wednesday, bringing an end to a contentious chapter in the US House of Representatives that included a  lawsuit  and  rising tensions inside the Capitol  over her seating.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson  had said  he would not swear in the Arizona Democrat amid the government shutdown until the House returned to legislative session, a delay that prompted outrage from Democrats. The swearing in took place after the chamber reconvened to vote on a Senate-passed bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Shaking her hand on Wednesday, Johnson described the disagreement over the delay in swearing Grijalva in as “some intense fellowship.”\n \n\n   \n  While she waited to be sworn in, Grijalva had been unable to perform basic constituent services or even open an office in her southern Arizona district. Previously describing herself as a “tourist with an office,” she told CNN that up until Wednesday she hasn’t had a working office phone, an office budget or the ability to use government systems. Residents of the sprawling district had been without a vote in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva was sworn in on the House floor to a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona’s 7th Congressional District elected me to represent them,” Grijalva said on Wednesday. “This is an abuse of power. One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing in of a duly elected member of Congress for a political reason.”\n \n\n   \n  Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva become the decisive 218th member in support of an effort to force the House to vote on the release of all of the Jeffrey Epstein case files, an issue that has roiled the House and sparked division among Republicans. Hours before her signature advanced the effort forward, top Trump administration officials  met with  at least one Republican who had also signed onto the petition.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors were in the gallery to watch Grijalva be sworn in.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we the American people,” Grijalva said. “That is why I will discharge petition right now to release the Epstein files. Justice cannot wait another day.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued that Johnson delayed swearing Grijalva in because she would be the deciding signature that would trigger the floor vote and pointed to other instances where Johnson moved quickly to swear in Republicans who won their special elections. Johnson said Wednesday he’d put the measure requiring Congress to release the Epstein files on the floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that’s different about me and the three other people that this speaker swore in in under 24 hours from the date of their elections is I’m the 218th signer,” Grijalva told CNN last month.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has defended his decision to delay Grijalva’s swearing by arguing that she won her race on September 23 when the House was already out of session and had vowed to swear her in as soon as the House returned.\n \n\n   \n  “I really like this lady. She is going to be an excellent member of Congress. She is a great person,” Johnson told Grijalva on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “She may not agree with me, but we followed the custom of the House on the timetable,” the speaker added. “I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn’t missed a vote and we’re delighted you’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  The House has been out of session since September 19, as Johnson put pressure on Senate Democrats to compromise with Republicans and vote to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown dragged on, the pressure on Johnson to swear in Grijalva mounted. Arizona’s Democratic senators got into a hallway confrontation with Johnson over the issue and other Democrats staged protests outside of the speaker’s office. Arizona’s attorney general even  sued  the House of Representatives over the delay, a move that Johnson  dismissed  as “patently absurd” and a bid for publicity.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva filled the seat vacated by her father, the  late Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva , who represented the district in Congress for more than two decades before  he died  after a battle with cancer in March. Running on the strength of her family name, she sailed to victory in the Democratic primary this summer and then defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the special election, capturing roughly 70% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson complimented Grijalva’s late father and reflected on his time working with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I just told her on the way in that she fills her father’s shoes, or she is going to try, no one can. He was giant around here, served a long time, served his state very well. I served under him on the Natural Resources Committee for awhile, admired the way he did the work, he was tenacious. So, she has a proud family legacy, and we’re delighted to have her here,” Johnson said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  When asked on Wednesday, why it took so long for her to be sworn in, Grijalva said, motioning toward Johnson, “that would not be my question.”\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva has been frustrated by the delay in her swearing in and has said the hardest part about delaying her swearing in was being unable to help her constituents during the longest government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve really missed the opportunity to be able to help constituents that are here that need services. So it’s been very difficult to sit it out while people come up to me and ask me for help,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/dhs-ice-immigrants-chicago-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:06:00-05:00","title":"DHS says agents were shot at amid chaotic day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood on Saturday morning during an immigration enforcement operation dubbed 'Operation Midway Blitz.'

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:06 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling  Thursday limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Thursday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melissa-hortman-death-vance-boelter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00-05:00","title":"Prosecutors turn over 130,000 pages of evidence in the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile case involving the murder of Minnesota lawmakers Melissa and Mark Hortman, and John and Yvette Hoffman, Vance Boelter is charged with federal and state murder and attempted murder charges.

and her husband said Wednesday that prosecutors have turned over a massive amount of evidence to the defense, and that his lawyers need more time to review it.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutor Harry Jacobs told the court that investigators have provided substantially all of the evidence they have collected against Vance Boelter. He’s  pleaded not guilty  to murder in the killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and to attempted murder in the shootings of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Some evidence, such as lab reports, continues to come in.\n \n\n   \n  Federal defender Manny Atwal said at the status conference that the evidence includes over 130,000 pages of PDF documents, over 800 hours of audio and video recordings, and over 2,000 photographs from what authorities have called the largest hunt for a suspect in Minnesota history.\n \n\n   \n  Atwal said her team has spent close to 110 hours just downloading the material — not reviewing it — and that they’re still evaluating the evidence, a process she said has gone slowly due to the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not unusual for a complex case but it is lot of information for us to review,” Atwal told Magistrate Judge Dulce Foster.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said he didn’t have a timeline for when the Department of Justice would decide whether to  seek the death penalty  against Boelter. The decision will be up to US Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n \n\n   \n  Foster scheduled the next status conference for February 12 and asked prosecutors to keep the defense and court updated in the meantime about their death penalty decision. She did not set a trial date.\n \n\n   \n  Hortman and her husband, Mark, and Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot by a man who came to their suburban homes in the early hours of June 14, disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car.\n \n\n   \n  Boelter, 58, was captured near his home in rural Green Isle late the next day. He faces federal and state charges including murder and attempted murder in what prosecutors have called a political assassination.\n \n\n   \n  Boelter, who was wearing orange and yellow jail clothing, said nothing during the nine-minute hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911 and has never had a federal death penalty case. But the Trump administration is pushing for  greater use of capital punishment. \n \n\n   \n  Boelter’s attorney has not commented on the substance of the allegations. His motivations remain murky and statements he has made to some media haven’t been fully clear. Friends have described him as a politically conservative evangelical Christian, and occasional preacher and missionary.\n \n\n   \n  Boelter claimed to the conservative outlet Blaze News in August that he never intended to shoot anyone that night but that his plans went horribly wrong.\n \n\n   \n  He told Blaze in a series of hundreds of texts via his jail’s messaging system that he went to the Hoffmans’ home to make citizens’ arrests over what he called his two-year undercover investigation into 400 deaths from the COVID-19 vaccine that he believed were being covered up by the state.\n \n\n   \n  But he told Blaze he opened fire when the Hoffmans and their adult daughter tried to push him out the door and spoiled his plan. He did not explain why he went on to allegedly shoot the Hortmans and their golden retriever, Gilbert, who had to be euthanized.\n \n\n   \n  Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said when she announced Boelter’s indictment on state charges in August that she gave no credence to the claims Boelter had made from jail.\n \n\n   \n  In other recent developments, a Sibley County judge last month granted Boelter’s wife a divorce.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/dana-williamson-indicted-former-california-governor-aide","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:05:00-05:00","title":"Former Aide to California Governor Indicted for Alleged Theft of Campaign Funds from Ex-Health Secretary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dana Williamson, a former top aide and chief of staff to California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been indicted on 23 federal charges, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, falsifying tax returns, and making false statements.

He is not implicated in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra’s dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra’s campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie’s wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n \n\n   \n  When Williamson prepared to join Newsom’s office in late 2022, she arranged for “Co-Conspirator 2” — an unnamed former public official — to take over her role in the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson told the Los Angeles Times that year that she planned to sever financial ties to her company while working for the governor. However the indictment includes details of emails, calls, and meetings between her and McCluskie regarding the alleged scheme and cover-up while she was Newsom’s chief of staff, a position she held until late 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the Covid-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n \n\n   \n  McCluskie signed a plea deal October 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: “Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”\n \n\n   \n  Becerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson faces 23 charges, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the US Attorney’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra’s campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom’s chief of staff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/uk/british-police-maga-influencer-incident-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"British Police Want to Speak to MAGA Influencer and Partner After London Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British police are seeking information from Trump-supporting influencer Melissa Rein Lively and German private equity partner Philipp Ostermann following a racially aggravated incident at Bond Street Tube Station in central London on October 11, 2025.

police published an appeal for information indicating that they want to speak to two people following what police called a “racially aggravated” incident in central London.\n \n\n   \n  The British Transport Police on Monday  released  a photograph of individuals they are seeking to question regarding the incident. CNN has identified the couple in the photo as MAGA influencer Melissa Rein Lively and her financier partner Philipp Ostermann.\n \n\n   \n  Police did not say whether they believed the couple was involved in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Police said the incident took place at 7.30pm local time on October 11 at Bond Street Tube station, in the heart of London’s shopping district.\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, police said a woman was racially abused and assaulted as she was entering a train station with her family.\n \n\n   \n  “The victim was entering Bond Street Underground station with her sister and two young children, one of whom was in a pushchair. A man and women were walking together in front of them when the woman collided with the pushchair,” police said.\n \n\n   \n  “The man then began shouting racial abuse at the victim and her family, before the woman grabbed her hair. When the victim tried to defend herself the man pulled out a small bottle and said it was pepper spray before spraying it in the direction of the victim and her family. The woman shouted abuse and made lewd gestures at them before both parties left the area,” police said.\n \n\n   \n  The use of pepper spray is illegal in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  “Officers believe the man and woman in the image could have information that may assist their enquiries,” police said.\n \n\n   \n   Rein Lively  is a Trump-supporting influencer and the head of America First PR, an Arizona-based company Lively has described as “anti-woke,” and Ostermann, a German businessman working in private equity.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Rein Lively and Ostermann. Rein Lively did not address CNN’s question for comment in her response but sent an unrelated press release. Ostermann did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Rein Lively’s account on X is temporarily disabled. Her company’s website details a plan to launch a transatlantic “sister agency,” in “alignment with our mission to protect and advance shared Western values called “Europe First PR.”\n \n\n   \n  Rein Lively is a known figure in conservative circles and campaigned for the White House Press Secretary role  last year , posting images of herself at US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club - the epicenter of his presidential transition - and speaking on right-wing news outlets about her bid for the job.\n \n\n   \n  But she is also known for an incident inside a Scottsdale, Arizona Target store during the height of the Covid 19-pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2020 a video of her destroying a mask display at the retailer went viral, leading to online commentators dubbing her “QAnon Karen.”\n \n\n   \n  Rein Lively, a former QAnon follower, gave subsequent interviews denouncing her behavior and involvement with the group she later called a “cult.”\n \n\n   \n  Ostermann, an Associate Director at a Munich-based private equity firm, was scheduled to speak at a private equity conference in London on October 14 .

Adelita Grijalva was  sworn in as the newest member of the House  after a weeks-long delay.\n \n\n   \n  The swearing in came ahead of a critical vote in the chamber to pass a Senate-approved bill to reopen the federal government and put an end to the longest shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats still vacant. Speaker Mike Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote.\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona Democrat’s swearing will pave the way for a highly anticipated vote to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Grijalva is expected to deliver the decisive signature on a petition from GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to force  a House vote  on the release of files related to the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had refused to call the House back into session or swear in Grijalva for weeks amid the government shutdown following her special election win at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker had indicated he would call the House back into session and swear in Grijalva once the Senate passed a bill to reopen the government – which they did earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  One of the vacant House seats, in Tennessee, leans Republican and will be filled by a special election next month. The other vacancy is in Texas where two Democrats have advanced to a runoff. That has not been yet scheduled but will be held early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-trump-emails-oversight-committee","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:29:00-05:00","title":"Epstein Mentioned Trump Multiple Times in Private Emails, New Release Shows","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, mentioned Donald Trump multiple times in private emails dating back nearly 15 years, asserting that Trump spent time at Epstein’s home and knew about the girls involved in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.

Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:29 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence that began almost 15 years ago with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit, according to newly released emails from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  The emails to longtime Epstein associate  Ghislaine Maxwell , who was convicted of sex trafficking after Epstein’s death, and the author Michael Wolff include conversations in which Epstein asserts Trump spent significant time with a woman whom Oversight Democrats describe as a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking. The emails also include a message in which Epstein asserts Trump “knew about the girls” — seemingly in reference to Trump’s  claim that he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club  for poaching young women who worked there, according to the newly released emails.\n \n\n   \n  The emails were released Wednesday morning by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which obtained them after  subpoenaing Epstein’s estate earlier this year , hours before the GOP-led panel released thousands more documents from the estate. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predated his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and the White House on Wednesday cast the issue as a “hoax” with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, Giuffre writes that her father, who was maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, got her a job as a locker room attendant. She wrote: “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. ‘Do you like kids?’ he asked. ‘Do you babysit at all?’ He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends, many of whom had children who needed tending.”\n \n\n   \n  She does not accuse Trump of wrongdoing in the book, “Nobody’s Girl.”\n \n\n   \n  About three years before the email – in June 2008 – Epstein had been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison after pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was released from prison in July 2009, having served just 13 months. Years later, his plea deal would face media scrutiny, including from the Miami Herald, and face widespread  criticism as being too lenient .\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in  an interview earlier this year  that she “never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings.\n \n\n   \n  “The President was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny amid a political firestorm in Washington over whether and when the federal government will release its files on the late sex trafficker who  died in prison in 2019 . The  controversy heated up earlier this year  when Trump’s own Justice Department declared that it  stood by its previous conclusion that Epstein died by suicide  and that it did not plan to provide any more information on the case.\n \n\n   \n  That sparked an outcry in Congress and among  some members of Trump’s own MAGA base , and it breathed life into efforts to pry loose new information. The House Oversight Committee successfully sought materials from the estate, and there is a separate effort underway in Congress to force a vote on compelling the release of more files from the US government. That effort received a critical, 218th supporter when  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  signed the discharge petition after being sworn in Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Wednesday criticized Democrats on the House Oversight Committee for releasing the messages, claiming the members “selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump’s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump echoed those criticisms in a series of Truth Social posts Wednesday afternoon, accusing of Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” and issuing a warning to Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” he added, as several GOP lawmakers have signed onto the House push to force a vote compelling the release of the Justice Department’s files related to Epstein. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term and about seven months before Epstein died by suicide in prison.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In her interview with Blanche, Maxwell denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the US president has denied any wrongdoing. He  filed a libel lawsuit  against the publisher of the Wall Street Journal and reporters who wrote  a story  about a  collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003 , including a note bearing Trump’s name and an outline of a naked woman.\n \n\n   \n  In a third email released by the Oversight committee and viewed by CNN Wednesday, Wolff — who published a book on Trump’s West Wing in 2018 — wrote Epstein with the subject line “heads up” on December 15, 2015. That was the day of a CNN Republican primary debate, but there is no mention of Epstein in the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you–either on air or in scrum afterwards,” Wolff reportedly wrote to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein, according to the email, responded, “if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff answered, “I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff has indicated publicly that he has interviewed Epstein, and The Daily Beast has reported it obtained recordings in which Epstein spoke at length to the author about Trump and claimed the two were close friends. Trump’s camp has called the recordings “false smears,” according to  the Daily Beast .\n \n\n   \n  Following the House Oversight Democrats’ release of the emails with Wolff and Maxwell, the GOP-led panel released an additional 20,000 pages it had received from Epstein’s estate, including messages where Epstein criticized his onetime friend after Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald is f**king crazy,” Epstein wrote in one January 2017 email to a New York Times reporter, one week after Trump’s inauguration. In another December 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, he called the president “borderline insane.” That same month he emailed former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior.\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power,” he wrote. “tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler, who did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, and Epstein were corresponding at the time. But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melodee-buzzard-disappearance-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Timeline of 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 9-year-old girl, Melodee Buzzard, disappeared from her home in Lompoc, California, on October 14, 2025, after being absent from school.

In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 10 , the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Mother arrested on false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard faces a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She was being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/climate/newsom-trump-invasive-species-cop30-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:31:00.000Z","title":"Newsom calls Trump an ‘invasive species’ and ‘wrecking ball’ in fiery remarks at COP30 climate summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom sharply criticized President Donald Trump, calling him an 'invasive species' and a 'wrecking ball' for abandoning U.S. climate action and rolling back clean energy policies.

species’ and ‘wrecking ball’ in fiery remarks at COP30 climate summit \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:31 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom pulled no punches at the COP30 climate talks in Brazil on Tuesday, calling President Donald Trump an “invasive species” and a “wrecking ball” during discussions about the US  absence from global climate action .\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, a Democrat widely viewed as a likely presidential candidate in 2028, is the most high-profile US political figure attending the talks in the Amazon city of Belém. The Trump administration made the unprecedented decision not to send a high-level delegation to the annual talks — the latest move in its sharp pull away from global climate action.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has spent the past year tearing up climate policies, seeking to  strangle clean energy projects , pushing other countries to buy US oil and gas and  withdrawing the US  from the Paris climate agreement. In a speech at the United Nations in September, Trump called climate change a “con job.”   \n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has a history of sparring with Trump, appears to be using COP30 as an opportunity to set out a different vision for US climate action. “I do not want the United States of America to be a footnote on climate policy,” he said at an event Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  He took sharp, personal aim at Trump for abandoning efforts to tackle the climate crisis. “He’s an invasive species. He is. He’s a wrecking ball president. And he’s trying to roll back progress of the last century … he’s doubling down on stupid,” Newsom   said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s stance is handing victory to China, he added. China is dominating clean energy supply chains and manufacturing “because they understand the great economic opportunity,” Newsom said.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom was also asked about the Trump administration’s reported plan to open the California coast to oil and gas drilling, as  reported  in The Washington Post yesterday based on a leaked draft map.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never going to happen. Over our dead body. Dead on arrival. Period. Full stop,” Newsom said. He asked the audience to consider why Trump might be targeting California. “He has no interest in opening up oil drilling rigs right off the coast of Florida, across the street from Mar-a-Lago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House shot back with its own fiery reply to Newsom’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, sent this in response to a request for comment: “Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing! If Gavin Newscum’s﻿   support for the climate agenda was sincere, he would not be attending a climate summit that required chopping down thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest for a special purpose highway. It’s time for Newscum and other countries to drop the climate facade. President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  The special-purpose highway Rogers referred to is a four-lane road built through the rainforest to Belém, which Brazilian authorities say was planned before the city’s COP bid.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also spoke about the need to make the climate crisis more tangible. Talking about average global temperature rises and using terms like “greenhouse gas” makes climate change seem “abstract,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  People can see climate change unfolding before their eyes, he added, referring to the  devastating Los Angeles wildfires  in January, which scientists say were made larger and more intense by planet-warming pollution.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also talked about the need for the Democratic party to reframe climate action around affordability in upcoming elections, pointing to rising energy costs as Trump pulls away from clean energy and an insurance crisis unfolding in the US as extreme weather becomes increasingly destructive.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to talk in terms that people understand … it’s about people, it’s about places, it’s about lifestyles, it’s about traditions,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-domestic-talent-jobs-h1b-visas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00-05:00","title":"Trump says United States doesn’t have people with ‘certain talents’ to fill jobs domestically","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the H-1B visa program, asserting that the United States lacks workers with 'certain talents' capable of filling critical domestic jobs, especially in complex and dangerous industries such as battery manufacturing.

says United States doesn’t have people with ‘certain talents’ to fill jobs domestically \n       \n  By Donald Judd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:27 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  told Fox News in an interview that aired Tuesday night the United States doesn’t have workers with “certain talents” to fill jobs needed domestically, defending the  H1-B skilled worker visa program. \n \n\n   \n  Pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether his administration would  reduce H1-B visas  over concerns it would depress wages for American workers, Trump told Ingraham, “I agree — but you also do have to bring in talent.”\n \n\n   \n  When the Fox host responded, “We have plenty of talented people here,” Trump replied, “No, you don’t, no you don’t … you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory where we’re going to make missiles.’”\n \n\n   \n  The president pointed to the  September ICE raid of a Georgia Hyundai facility , which saw authorities arrest and deport hundreds of South Korean contractors over their immigration status, as evidence of the country’s need for skilled foreign workers.\n \n\n   \n  “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments come just two weeks after he told reporters traveling with him to South Korea that he was   “very much opposed” to the raid  carried out by federal officers as part of his administration’s immigration crackdown at US worksites.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signed an executive action in September to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas. The move marked the latest in a series of efforts from the administration to crack down on immigration and place sharp new limits on the types of foreigners allowed into the country.\n \n\n   \n  The H-1B visa is a work visa that’s valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments during the interview drew criticism Wednesday from Republican Congresswoman — and Trump ally — Marjorie Taylor Greene, who  took to social media  to write, “I believe in the American people. I am one of you.”\n \n\n   \n  “I believe you are good, talented, creative, intelligent, hard working, and want to achieve,” Greene said on X. “I am solidly against you being replaced by foreign labor, like with H1Bs.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia congresswoman has been a fierce backer of Trump since being elected to the House in 2020, but has broken with her party in recent weeks over health care and Trump’s focus on international relations, which she’s said has come at the expense of domestic issues.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fired back at Greene’s criticisms in remarks from the Oval Office Monday, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins she’s “lost her way,” and is now “catering to the other side.”\n \n\n   \n  In the first part of the Fox News interview that aired Monday, Trump  took a swipe at the nation of France  while defending the enrollment of Chinese students at universities in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually think it’s good to have outside countries,” the president said when asked about enrolling Chinese nationals at American universities.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not the French. They’re the Chinese. They spy on us. They steal our intellectual property,” Ingraham responded.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you think the French are better?” Trump said. Ingraham replied, “Yeah,” to which the president said, “I’m not so sure.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/devil-wears-prada-2-teaser","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:13:00Z","title":"Meryl Streep reunites with Anne Hathaway in ‘The Devil Wears Prada 2’ teaser: ‘Took you long enough’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'The Devil Wears Prada 2' reveals a reunion of Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs, continuing their journey from the original 2006 film.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The American penny passed away today after a prolonged illness. It was 238 years old.\n \n\n   \n  The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia, overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach .  President Donald Trump announced via social media in February that he instructed the Mint to  stop making  the once-popular coin, citing the cost of production.\n \n\n   \n  The penny  costs nearly four cents  to mint, more than the coin’s worth. Once valuable enough to buy “penny candy” like gumballs and feed parking meters or toll booths, today the penny lives mostly in coin jars, junk drawers or “leave a penny/take a penny” trays.\n \n\n   \n  Beach said Wednesday that the final coins pressed will be auctioned off and that the actual last pennies put into circulation from the US Mint were struck in June.   \n \n\n   \n  The penny outlived its sibling, the half-penny, by 168 years. It’s survived by the nickel, dime, quarter, and rarely seen half-dollar and dollar coins.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its demise, the penny will remain  legal tender .\n \n\n   \n    Problems despite long planned end\n \n\n   \n  For a coin that seems obsolete, its removal from circulation is causing more problems than expected, especially for retailers.\n \n\n   \n  Some merchants plan to round prices to the nearest nickel, often a penny or two more. Others are asking customers to pay with pennies to help supply. But in some states, merchants could face legal trouble for rounding up or down.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, any savings from discontinuing the one-cent coin could be offset by the need to press more nickels, which costs the US Mint  more money  than the penny.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s phasing out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic,” said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, the company that provides the blanks used to make pennies. “By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”\n \n\n   \n  Weller said other countries that removed low denomination coins, like Canada, Australia and Switzerland, had guidance for afterwards. Not so in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said, referring to the president’s February announcement.\n \n\n   \n    Different rounding plans\n \n\n   \n  Kwik Trip, a family-owned convenience store chain that operates in the Midwest, decided to round down cash purchases in stores where it hasn’t been able to find pennies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” said John McHugh, spokesperson for the company. “I mean, it’s not their fault that there there’s a penny shortage.”\n \n\n   \n  But with 20 million customers a year, and 17% of them paying with cash, the policy will eventually cost Kwik Trip a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just businesses that face increased costs. Rounding to the closest nickel will cost consumers about $6 million a year, according to a July study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is fairly modest, coming to about five cents each across 133 million American households.\n \n\n   \n  And rounding is not a national solution.\n \n\n   \n  Four states - Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon - as well as numerous cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington, DC, require merchants to provide exact change, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the law covering the federal food assistance program known as SNAP requires that recipients not be charged more than other customers. Since SNAP recipients use a debit card that’s charged the precise amount, if merchants round down prices for cash purchases, they could be opening themselves to legal problems and fines, said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for NACS.\n \n\n   \n  “Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” Lenard said. “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, NACS and other retail groups recently wrote to Congress asking for legislation to deal with the questions raised by the end of penny production.\n \n\n   \n    End of a ‘wonderful life’\n \n\n   \n  The penny was one of the nation’s first coins, first minted in 1787, six years before the Mint itself was established.\n \n\n   \n  Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with designing the first penny known as the Fugio cent. Its current form arrived in 1909 on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, when it became the first American coin to feature a president.\n \n\n   \n  But it has declined in both use and popularity ever since. The Treasury Department now says there are  an estimated 300 billion pennies  in circulation. That comes to a bit less than $9 for every American. But most of those coins are “severely underutilized.” So, outcry from the public over its demise has been muted.\n \n\n   \n  Joe Ditler, a 74-year old writer and historian from Colorado, said he still has an old cigar box filled with mostly pennies given to him by his grandfather. He remembers flattening pennies on railroad tracks or souvenir machines in amusement parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he only occasionally uses pennies to make a cash purchase. And he often tosses the one-cent coin in the tip jar.\n \n\n   \n  “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said. “The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”\n \n\n   \n   -CNN’s Danny Freeman contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592335","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"'We Need to Get Out of Here': Trump's Immigration Crackdown Is Quietly Reshaping Where Immigrants Live in America","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Under the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement, undocumented immigrants across the U.S. are experiencing both self-deportation and internal migration.

   \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         A woman named \"E\" was at a clothing store in Tampa, Florida with her daughter when she realized it was time to leave. It was her daughter's 15th birthday, and she wanted to buy her an outfit. She says she felt the salespeople giving them looks. \"Real ugly looks,\" she says. \"They could call immigration,\" she recalls telling her daughter. \"You're an American citizen, but you're also Hispanic. We need to get out of here.\" They left the store, she says, with the feeling that it was also time to leave the state. The question this family is grappling with is: where to? Under the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, many are deciding to hide in place, while others are self-deporting. But there's also anecdotal evidence that people are relocating, from cities with aggressive immigration enforcement to places with fewer raids, where they feel safer. E. asked that we only use her first initial, because she and her husband are both undocumented. She says she'd like to go back to Guatemala as soon as possible. Her daughter, who recently started high school, wants to stay   in Florida .  So does her husband, who feels that after some 20 years living in the U.S., this is home. But under the leadership of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, Florida has embarked on one of the strictest immigration crackdowns in the nation, vowing to lead the way in President Trump's campaign. Her husband's workplace - a construction site - was recently raided. He just happened to be out that day. And the family knows multiple people who've been deported, including their own church pastor. For now, the family has decided to leave Florida for a small town in Michigan. A neighbor friend, also an immigrant, just moved there. \"She called me recently,\" E. says, and she told me, 'why don't you come up here? Things are quiet here. You don't hear about raids. And I can find you a job.'\" It's hard to track the movement of undocumented immigrants throughout the U.S. There are no exact numbers. Demographer Matt Brooks at Florida State University studies  these population flows , and says we've been seeing clear trends since at least the 1980s. \"There's definitely a pattern and on the aggregate these patterns make a lot of sense.\"    Brooks says immigration to the U.S. is often a multi-step process: migrants tend to first land in big cities, but in time they make  a second move , increasingly to the South or the Midwest, seeking out jobs in agriculture or manufacturing. And, he says, sometimes there's a third move: away from immigration enforcement to   cities and towns that seem safer. Brooks points to Mississippi as an example. In 2019, there was a  massive immigration raid  at multiple food-processing plants near Jackson. \"We know that immigrants have been leaving Mississippi ever since,\" he says. Following that raid, he points out \"the flow of immigrants out of MIssissippi is more than double the flow in.\" The Trump administration hasn't hit its first anniversary yet, but the immigration crackdown is already having widespread effects. The Department of Homeland Security claims  1.6 million immigrants  have left the country voluntarily, what the administration calls self-deportation. There's also evidence of something else: internal migration, as families flee enforcement zones for safer ground. For a Salvadoran man in Omaha, Nebraska who asked to be referred to by his first initial, R., relocating to another state was a panicked, last minute decision. Over the summer, a major raid at a meat packing plant sent shockwaves throughout immigrant communities in Nebraska. The morning after, R. says he sat in the parking lot of his factory, debating whether to go into work or leave the state altogether. \"I feel that I'm in between a rock and a hard place,\" he told NPR.. He's asked for his full name to be withheld because he is worried for his safety, as he is seeking asylum in the U.S. from El Salvador's authoritarian government. He says to be sent back could be a death sentence. A few days later, R. was gone. He drove almost non-stop from Nebraska to North Carolina—21 hours behind the wheel, fueled by coffee and electrolytes. The destination: a small city his friend said was safe, where immigration raids were rare or non-existent. When he got there, he went straight to work at his new roofing gig. That was five months ago. NPR recently checked in with him. \"It's been quiet here,\" he says. He wouldn't say he's happy, but there are fewer Hispanics, \"so the town just isn't a big immigration enforcement target.\" At least for now. He's hoping it stays that way. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Some people without legal status are deciding to self-deport, to leave the United States in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Other people are changing where they live within the country. They move from cities with aggressive immigration enforcement to places where they feel more protected. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: A woman who asked that we call her by her first initial, E, recalls the moment she realized it was time to leave. She was at a clothing store in Tampa, Florida. It was her daughter's 15th birthday, and she wanted to buy her an outfit. E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: She felt the salespeople giving them looks, real ugly looks, she says. E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: She told her daughter, \"they could call immigration and they'll take us. You're an American citizen, but you're also Hispanic. Let's get out of here,\" she said. The question this family is grappling with is, where to? E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: E says she wants to go back to Guatemala desperately. Her husband wants to stay in the U.S., so does their daughter. She asked that we only use her first initial because she and her husband are both undocumented. The couple has lived in Tampa, Florida, for some two decades. Her husband's workplace, a construction site, was recently raided. He just happened to be out that day. And the family knows multiple people who've been deported, including their own church pastor. So they decided to leave Florida for a small town in Michigan. A neighbor friend, also an immigrant, just moved there. E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"She called me recently,\" E says, \"and she tells me, why don't you come up here?\" E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"Things are quiet here. You don't hear about raids, and I can find you a job,\" she recalls the neighbor telling her. It's hard to track the movement of undocumented immigrants throughout the U.S. There are no exact numbers. Demographer Matt Brooks at Florida State University studies these population flows, and he says we've been seeing clear trends since at least the 1980s. MATT BROOKS: There's definitely a pattern. On the aggregate population level that demographers study, these patterns make a lot of sense. GARSD: Brooks says immigrants often land in big cities, but then they make a second move, increasingly to the South or Midwest for jobs in agriculture or manufacturing. And then sometimes there's a third move, away from immigration enforcement to cities and towns that seem safer. BROOKS: For example, in 2019, in Mississippi, there was the largest single-day immigration raid. We know that immigrants have been leaving Mississippi ever since. So the flow of immigrants out of Mississippi is more than double the flow in. GARSD: The Trump administration claims that more than 1.6 million immigrants have self-deported since the president returned to office. But there's also anecdotal evidence that immigrants are relocating within the U.S. to get away from enforcement target areas. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: Over the summer, in Omaha, Nebraska, there was a major raid at a meatpacking plant. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: The morning after, a Salvadoran man - who asked that we refer to him by his first initial, R, because he's worried about his safety as an asylum-seeker - sent NPR this audio message.

Doctors are pushing for balance \n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to  remove the “black box” warning  on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.\n \n\n   \n  By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near  antibiotics and vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Makary blamed the broad   22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”\n \n\n   \n  “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.\n \n\n   \n  Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.\n \n\n   \n  They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a  comprehensive research review  published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.\n \n\n   \n  Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.\n \n\n   \n  After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”\n \n\n   \n    How the FDA pivoted\n \n\n   \n  In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.\n \n\n   \n  After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered   that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.\n \n\n   \n  Women stopped using hormones in droves.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.\n \n\n   \n  “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”\n \n\n   \n  Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.\n \n\n   \n  Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch  most of the black box warning  — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an  expert panel  discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to  a Viewpoint article  co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)\n \n\n   \n  “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.\n \n\n   \n  But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.”  The study  Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.\n \n\n   \n  Makary also didn’t mention   the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of   [hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.\n \n\n   \n  Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.\n \n\n   \n  The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”\n \n\n   \n  In the past, the agency has followed  a very different protocol  when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment   Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency  followed similar steps , including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”\n \n\n   \n    Looking for a more balanced approach\n \n\n   \n  In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.\n \n\n   \n  Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.\n \n\n   \n  Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.\n \n\n   \n  Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.\n \n\n   \n  This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.\n \n\n   \n  “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.\n \n\n   \n  Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.\n \n\n   \n  “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the evidence shows about hormones\n \n\n   \n  All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.\n \n\n   \n  “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”\n \n\n   \n  There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988.  One study  estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.\n \n\n   \n  But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.\n \n\n   \n  Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.\n \n\n   \n  “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”\n \n\n   \n  Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.\n \n\n   \n  Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”\n \n\n   \n  Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent viewpoint  published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.\n \n\n   \n  “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   \n  Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.\n \n\n   \n  She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.\n \n\n   \n  “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5601773","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Digital Transformation of Media: The Rise of Social Media and User-Generated Content","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines how digital technology is transforming the media landscape.

I often think Father Time is the main character of all the films we've done together.\" Hawke was only 13 when he made his first film,  Explorers.  He became a star at 18 with  Dead Poets Society.  More than 30 years later, he's still acting, except now when he gets a script he forgets he's no longer a young guy. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'll be sent a script and it says, 'Billy, age 19, skateboarding down the street,' and I think, 'Oh that's my part,'\" Hawke says. \"It takes me a while to realize, 'Oh, Billy's father, age 55, gruff and weathered around the edges. ... Oh, that's me.\" Hawke says his new film  Blue Moon   is one of the most challenging of his career. In it, he plays lyricist Lorenz Hart, the original songwriting partner of composer Richard Rodgers. The film captures Hart on the night that  Oklahoma! , Rodgers' musical with his new songwriting partner Oscar Hammerstein, debuts. Hart was afraid of being left behind and was a bundle of contradictions, simultaneously proud of his former partner and jealous of his success.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I felt I was being asked to play two things at the same time, which is of course why I wanna do it,\" Hawke says. \"Every now and then you bump up against a part that presses you to the wall of your ability and you know you can never be as good as the part is demanding of you — and that's a kind of thrilling spot to be in.\" Blue Moon  is Hawke's ninth collaboration with filmmaker Linklater. (Their previous films include  Boyhood   and the  Before  trilogy .) He's also starring in the horror film   Black Phone 2   and in the FX streaming series,  The Lowdown . Interview highlights  On working with Linklater on  Blue Moon He knows every trick in my toolbox and he was really asking me to disappear. He just wanted me to be Larry Hart. And so, the man has spent years of his life editing my performances. So anytime he would see me, he would say, \"I saw you!\" ... The physical things are kind of easy. ... Anybody can shave their head and do a comb-over. But it was really the soul of a person who was loathing themselves, and at the same time, thinks they're smarter than everybody else. ... Imagine if you only worked with one other person for 25 years and you achieved incredible heights and this person now doesn't wanna work with you anymore. So it's truly heartbreaking for him because I think he's smart enough to know that the world is changing, we're in the middle of the war, the jazz age is being left behind, something new is happening and he's not gonna be a part of it. On playing a journalist writing about corruption in  The Lowdown It's been a funny year for me because  Blue Moon  is probably the most different I've ever pushed myself outside the framework of my own identity. And then  The Lowdown  — I just relate to Lee, he's Quixote, chasing windmills, running into propellers. He's a dreamer and an idealist and self-centered, and doesn't see his own blind spots, and he's a moron, and I just completely relate to him. He can say the right thing all the time and do the wrong thing all of the time. And out of that obviously comes a lot of humor.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I kind of saw Lee as a guy who's frozen in 1996, or something. I'm still wearing the same pants I wore back then. I got the same belt buckle I wore back then. He's still listening to the same music he listened to back then. And I admire him, and I also identify with his shortcomings. [Series creator]  Sterlin [Harjo ] is really fun to work with. I had a great time on  Reservation Dogs . We got along like a house on fire. I can't remember a time I just ran with the character like I did with this one. On losing his friends  River Phoenix  and  Philip Seymour Hoffman  to overdoses \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       River was very sensitive, extremely sensitive and it's part of his genius. … Some of us get second chances and some of our DNA is hardwired to protect ourselves and some people don't have those guardrails. And I don't understand it, and I know that the answer is you have to know yourself. … Of course it was a warning. But we all get warnings. And I sometimes think a lot of it is accident. I remember when we were 23, I felt that we had lived, and now here I am, I'm about to be 55 years old and I've lived twice as long as River.  River didn't get to be a dad, and River didn't get to have the experiences of the rollercoaster ride of the ups and downs of a profession. I almost feel sadder about his death now, because I'd love to know what he thinks now. He was such a political young man and he was such an idealist. I would love to see what that looked like at 55. And I would like to see the artist that he would be and the art he would have made. I can't believe that Phil's gone. Half of why I act sometimes is to impress those two men that I was friends with. I think about them all the time when I'm performing, because they were the gauge by which I judged myself — and they still are. On aging I feel a desire to work. … I feel I'm aware of how much of the road has already been walked and ... I'm very aware of how many more years I might have to contribute. And I don't like wasting time anymore. I'm aware of how many people mentored me and cared for me. And am I doing that for others? Am I meeting my responsibilities as a citizen? Not just as a father, which is obvious and omnipresent in my life. Those questions are on my mind all the time.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then there's this other voice, which is, am I enjoying my life? Because I do want to enjoy it, too. And how much of this work that I'm obsessed with is eroding at my sense of play and joy and spontaneity and living and being in the moment. ... It is strange, the older you get, I have no awareness of wisdom, I only have awareness of how many things I thought I understood that I don't understand, and more questions come in the door, and that's kind of exciting.

My guest Ethan Hawke stars in two new movies. In \"Blue Moon,\" he plays lyricist Lorenz Hart. In the horror film \"Black Phone 2,\" he's a serial killer who dies and becomes a spirit, and he haunts people's dreams. He also stars in the current FX streaming series \"The Lowdown.\" It's a loving but humorous take on film noir created by Sterlin Harjo, who also directed Hawke in an episode of the popular series \"Reservation Dogs.\" Hawke just completed a new documentary called \"Highway 99: A Double Album,\" about country music star, songwriter, singer and guitarist Merle Haggard. It premiered at the Telluride Film Festival earlier in the fall, where he received the actor tribute. That film is expected to be released sometime next year. Hawke was in his early teens when he made his first film, \"Explorers,\" co-starring River Phoenix, who was about the same age. He was in his late teens when he co-starred in the \"Dead Poets Society,\" which starred Robin Williams. Hawke seems to have done it all - a child star who survived the experience intact, an Oscar and Tony-nominated actor, a documentary film director and a novelist. Let's start with a clip from \"Blue Moon,\" directed by Richard Linklater. It's set on the night of the opening of \"Oklahoma!\" - the first musical that Hart's longtime songwriting partner Richard Rodgers wrote with another lyricist, Oscar Hammerstein. There's an after-party at Sardi's, where theater people would go on opening night and wait until the reviews came out. Hart gets there first and talks with the bartender, feeling he's become insignificant because he was abandoned by Rodgers. Rodgers had moved on because Hart had been drinking too much and was no longer a reliable partner. In this scene, after Rodgers arrives, he talks with Hart. Hart's trying to convince Rodgers to collaborate on a satirical musical about Marco Polo. Rodgers is played by Andrew Scott. Ethan Hawke, as Hart, speaks first. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BLUE MOON\") ETHAN HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) I mean, \"Marco Polo\" is going to be a show about joy, but a hard-earned joy, an unsentimental joy. ANDREW SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) Something wrong with sentimental? HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) Well, it's too easy. SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) \"Oklahoma!\" is too easy? The guy actually getting the girl in the end is too easy? You've just eliminated every successful musical comedy ever written, Larry. HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) It's too easy for me. SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) Did you hear the audience tonight? HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) Yes. SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) Sixteen hundred people didn't think it was too easy. You're telling me 1,600 people were wrong? HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) I'm just saying, you and I can do something so much more emotionally complicated. We don't have to pander to what... SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) So Oscar and I are pandering? HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) No. I didn't say that. SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) Irving Berlin is pandering? HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) I love Berlin. SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) \"White Christmas\" is pandering? HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) Well, I don't believe \"White Christmas.\" SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) OK. (LAUGHTER) SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) Well, maybe audiences have changed. HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) Well, they still love to laugh. SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) They want to laugh, but not in that way. HAWKE: (As Lorenz Hart) In what way? SCOTT: (As Richard Rodgers) In your way. They want to laugh, but they also want to cry a little. They want to feel. GROSS: Ethan Hawke, welcome to FRESH AIR, and congratulations on all the new work you've been doing. I've been really enjoying it. You said that making \"Blue Moon\" stretched you and the director Richard Linklater to, like, the boundaries of your abilities. What made it so hard for you and so different? HAWKE: Well, first off, I guess the emotional complexity. I mean, there's the verbiage, the - Larry Hart is at this opening night party, and it's kind of like he feels if he ever stops talking, he's going to be shot and killed. And so he just cannot stop talking. GROSS: (Laughter). HAWKE: So there was the amount of text I had to learn, but then... GROSS: Yeah. HAWKE: ...There's the complication. He's incredibly - what is it? It's called the correlation of opposites. He's two things simultaneously all the time. He is incredibly jealous, and he's incredibly happy and proud of his friend. He's gay and in love with a woman. He's the most diminutive, smallest person in the room, and he's the biggest personality in the room. The whole experience of making it, I felt I was being asked to play two things at the same time, which is, of course, why I want to do it. It was wonderful, and it was like the way real people are. But it's challenging. Every now and then, you do - you bump up against a part that presses you to the wall of your ability, and you know you can never be as good as the part is demanding of you. And that's a kind of thrilling spot to be in. GROSS: So you're playing someone who thinks that their height, their hair makes them really ugly and unappealing. Plus, he's gay and he has to hide that from the public, from the people... HAWKE: Well, it was illegal in 1943. GROSS: Yeah. HAWKE: So he does have to hide it. Yeah. GROSS: No, absolutely. Right, right. So in a way, like, talking all the time is a distraction from all the things that he thinks are unappealing about him. And he's also very short. I think he's, like, 5 feet or under. You're pretty tall, and you had to have a comb-over for it, which is literally not attractive. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So you had to feel very much not like yourself. HAWKE: Well, it was interesting. I was being directed by a man who's directed me, and this is our ninth film collaboration. So he's - he knows every trick in my toolbox. And he was really asking me to disappear. I was - he wanted - he just wanted me to be Larry Hart. And so, I mean, the man has spent years of his life editing my performances. So anytime he would see me, he would say, I saw you. I saw you. I saw you. And he was... GROSS: I saw you, Ethan Hawke, and not Larry Hart. HAWKE: Yeah, and not Larry. And so the physical things are kind of - you know, they're kind of easy. They're superficial, ultimately, if they don't unlock the soul of the man, right? Anybody can shave their head and do a comb-over and - but it was really the soul of a person who's loathing themselves and, at the same time, thinks they're smarter than everybody else. And his intellect is his only power. His pride in his work is his only self-worth. And that is being stripped from him on this night. I mean, imagine if you only worked with one other person for 25 years and you achieved incredible heights, and this person now doesn't want to work with you anymore. So it's truly heartbreaking for him 'cause I think he's smart enough to know that the world is changing. We're in the middle of the war. The jazz age is being left behind. Something new is happening, and he's not going to be a part of it. And he feels a titanic plate shifting, you know, and he's being sent away to Antarctica or something. I mean, that's what I think he feels. GROSS: So I'm under 5 feet tall, and I might be shorter than he was. So how did playing somebody short and having to look up at people - what did you learn about my life at my height (laughter)? HAWKE: The world is so stupid in the way that it imagines power and intelligence and grace and, you know, tall and handsome, tall equating power, tall equating authority. It doesn't. Beauty is as beauty does. We all know this. It was - as a male, I think it's even more different because I remember there was a man who was really helping me with the height and how to achieve it. We were kind of trying to do it with old-school stagecraft. And he had built a floor that he could put his feet through and then wear his shoes on his shins, so he really appeared a foot shorter than he did. And his wife, who - they've been together for decades, came to him and was looking at him. She's like, wow, if you were this tall, I wouldn't love you. And it was really a heartbreaking experience for him that he really wanted to share with me that confused him deeply about how - what we associate as sexuality, what we associate with strength. And it did unlock for me, I mean, just even all my normal ways of flirting. I have all these scenes with Margaret Qualley, who's a beautiful young woman. And she would just giggle at everything I say and pat me on top of the head, and it was extremely patronizing. And you had to find a different set of tools to get her attention. So I don't know that I could speak intelligently about it, but I could feel it in my guts. GROSS: I need to take a short break here, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Ethan Hawke. And one of the movies he's currently starring in is \"Blue Moon,\" in which he plays lyricist Larry Hart. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GRAHAM REYNOLDS' \"BLUE MOON\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Ethan Hawke. He's starring in the new film \"Blue Moon,\" playing lyricist Larry Hart. He's the villain in the new horror film \"Black Phone 2.\" He stars in the current FX streaming series \"The Lowdown\" and was also in an episode of \"Reservation Dogs.\" They were both created by Sterlin Harjo. So you've played at least two brilliant but self-destructive artists, Chet Baker, the great jazz trumpeter and singer, who had several addictions, and Larry Hart, who died of complications from drinking way too much. It's not uncommon for talented artists. Oh, and River Phoenix, who you worked with, died of an overdose. HAWKE: Philip Seymour Hoffman. GROSS: Oh, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Yes, right. It's not uncommon for talented artists to have a self-destructive side or a need for the kind of medication that they believe, you know, the addiction provides for. Do you feel like you understand why those two things so often go together? HAWKE: Well, first off, I think humanity experiences this. I think we see it in public figures and artists because we're in the public more. Issues of addiction are complicating and destroying so much of society. And so many people are in pain. And these are painkillers. And I think the artistic community, to be driven to create usually is motivated by some sensitivity and extreme sensitivity. I don't know, I have seen it my whole life. You mentioned River. And that was an extremely complex and upsetting thing that happened in my early 20s, his passing. And then middle age brings its own demons, which happened to my friend Phil. And I think part of my collaboration with Rick and part of why I love working with Richard Linklater is he has so much joy in his life. And he didn't, when I was young and becoming friends with him, he was one of the first artists I met who really didn't see self-destruction as a romantic well to draw from. He had so much joy and love of life. But I do enjoy playing these parts because I do understand it. I grew up with so many men of the theater who were in so much pain. And they were some of the most ferociously intelligent and kind and good people that were full of so much self-loathing. And when I first read the script, I was desperate to play this guy. GROSS: Larry Hart? HAWKE: Yeah, yeah. GROSS: Yeah. So River Phoenix, who you made your first movie with him, \"The Explorers.\" So he died at age 23 in 1993 of an OD of morphine and cocaine. Was that a warning for you, you know, like, don't touch this stuff? Like, were you ever seduced by the relief of addictive drugs? HAWKE: I don't know. What flashes through my mind is when River and I were doing \"The Explorers,\" we both were at a - we both love James Dean. And James Dean smoked Camel unfiltered cigarettes. And we thought it would be cool to go out and we stole a pack of Camel unfiltereds and went out in this field and smoked three of them. And River turned green, and he vomited. And when he passed, I thought about that moment, that we all have different bodies. And some of us can press the limit, and our bodies can handle it, and we can learn from it. And some of us turn green. And River was very sensitive, extremely sensitive. And it's part of his genius. I don't know. Does that make sense to you, what I'm trying to communicate? GROSS: Yeah. No, yes, yes. HAWKE: And some of us get second chances. And some of us, our DNA is hardwired to protect ourselves. And some people don't have those guardrails. And I don't understand it. And I know that the answer is, you have to know yourself. And, yes, to your question, was it a warning? Of course it was a warning. But we all get warnings. And I sometimes think a lot of it is accident. And I wish - I remember when we were 23, I felt that we had lived. And now, here I am, you know, I'm about to be 55 years old. And I've lived twice as long as River. River didn't get to be a dad, and River didn't get to have the experiences of the roller coaster ride of the ups and downs of a profession. I almost feel sadder about his death now because I would love to see him. I'd love to see what he thinks now. He was such a political young man, and he was such an idealist. I would love to see what that looked like at 55. GROSS: Yeah. HAWKE: And I would love to see the artist that he would be and the art he would've made. I can't believe that Phil's gone. Half of why I act sometimes is to impress those two men that I was friends with, you know? I mean, I think about them all the time when I'm performing because they were the gauge by which I judged myself, and they still are. GROSS: I want to ask you about time. The film \"Boyhood\" was shot, directed by Richard Linklater, who just directed you in \"Blue Moon.\" It was shot over 12 years. And as this family aged, as the children and the divorced parents aged, the actors aged. So that was a long-term commitment. \"Blue Moon\" takes place on one evening. It's practically shot in real time. So making movies that play with time like that, especially \"Boyhood\" over 12 years, I'm wondering if that has shaped your understanding of time, what time means to you. HAWKE: It has so much. And you're not even mentioning the \"Before\" trilogy, which... GROSS: Oh, yes. No, that's right. HAWKE: ...We shot over 18 years. GROSS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. HAWKE: And, you know... GROSS: And each movie was separated by a few years. HAWKE: Nine years. GROSS: Yeah. HAWKE: Yeah. I think it's part of the hook of Linklater and I's friendship as we both have a obsession with it, think about it all the time. It's omnipresent in our awareness. And I think that acting - \"Dead Poets Society\" came out, and I started being sent scripts. I'm 18, 19 years old. And now I'll be sent a script, and it says, Billy (ph), age 19, skateboarding down the street. And I always think, oh, that's my part. It's just the way I read scripts. It takes me a while to realize, oh, Billy's father, age 55, gruff and weathered around the edges. I'm like, oh, that's me. GROSS: (Laughter). HAWKE: I'm forced always to look at that. I remember watching the first screening of \"Boyhood\" with - Patricia Arquette and I were sitting next to each other, and she's... GROSS: And she co-stars with you. HAWKE: Yeah. And she leans over to me and says, wow, they're growing up, and we're aging. And it's funny. I don't know where that turn happens where we stop thinking of ourselves as growing, but acting forces you to be aware of time. Cinema naturally does it. The stories I gravitate to, particularly in the films with Richard Linklater, seem to be - I often think Father Time is the main character of all the films we've done together. GROSS: And you've made - what? - nine of them now. HAWKE: Yeah. Yeah. GROSS: So how is getting older affecting your relationship with the passage of time? HAWKE: Well, you're just hitting me with some real lightweight questions here. GROSS: Yeah, you're welcome. HAWKE: (Laughter) You know? Well, it's arresting for anybody, you know, I think when you get over the age of 50. It is. I feel it very powerfully. I feel a desire to work. I don't know if you feel that, but I feel I'm aware of how much of the road has already been walked. And I'm very conscious of - I find myself often thinking, how old was Jeff Bridges when he did \"True Grit\"? Am I older than him now? Am I younger than him? How old was Peter Weir when he directed \"Dead Poets Society\"? I'm older than he was now. I thought he was an old man. I'm very aware of how many more years I might have to contribute, and I don't like wasting time anymore. I'm very aware of how many people mentored me and cared for me, and am I doing that for others? Am I meeting my responsibilities as a citizen? Not just as a father, which is obvious and omnipresent in my life. The questions are on my mind all the time. Then there's this other voice, which is, am I enjoying my life? And I - 'cause I do want to enjoy it, too. And how much of this work that I'm obsessed with is eroding at my sense of play and joy and spontaneity and living and being in the moment? And it is strange. The older you get - I have no awareness of wisdom. I only have awareness of how many things I thought I understood that I don't understand, and more questions come in the door. And that's kind of exciting. What do you think? GROSS: Well, about aging, I mean, there comes a moment when you realize you're not the young person anymore. And then how people look at you changes as you get older. HAWKE: You know, I'm an actor, right? So I have a talent agent. And I remember being really proud of myself. At one time, I noticed I was the youngest client they had, and I was kind of proud of that. And now, often I'm the oldest person in the room, you know? I did this movie \"Black Phone 2,\" and there's all these young people around, and they're looking at me and talking to me as if I know something. GROSS: (Laughter). HAWKE: And I'm not positive that I do. GROSS: Well, we have to take another break, so I'm going to reintroduce you again. If you're just joining us, my guest is Ethan Hawke. And among the new things he's starring in are \"Blue Moon,\" about lyricist Larry Hart, and the Sterlin Harjo take on film noir, which is called \"The Lowdown.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DAVE MCKENNA'S \"HAVE YOU MET MISS JONES\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Ethan Hawke. He stars in two new movies. In \"Blue Moon,\" he plays lyricist Larry Hart. In the horror film \"Black Phone 2,\" he's a spirit in a devil's mask who haunts people's dreams. He's also in the current FX streaming series \"The Lowdown,\" the loving but humorous take on film noir created by Sterlin Harjo, who also created the series \"Reservation Dogs\" and directed Hawke in one episode. Hawke just completed a new documentary called \"Highway 99: A Double Album,\" about country music star, songwriter, singer and guitarist Merle Haggard. I want to ask you a little bit about your documentary you made a few years ago called \"Seymour: An Introduction.\" And it's about the pianist and composer Seymour Bernstein, who gave up a career as a touring pianist giving recitals. But he grew just really disillusioned with the life he was leading, performing all the time, traveling. And he gave it up after years as a performer and decided that his calling was teaching as a private teacher to, you know, a very talented pianist. And he's also very wise. You met him at a dinner party, and you'd asked him a couple of, you know, pretty profound questions, and he gave you interesting answers. So this documentary is all about him, and he was, I think, in his 80s when you made it. And he's in his late 90s now? HAWKE: Yes. GROSS: Yeah. So I want to play an excerpt of a conversation that you had with him that's in the film. And you tell him you're entering the second half of your life and thinking about what you want out of this next phase. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"SEYMOUR: AN INTRODUCTION\") HAWKE: I'm looking at myself, and I'm saying, you have the second half of your life ahead of you. If it's not for material gain, if I don't have a specific religious calling, what is it that I'm living it for? The whole system of life is geared to make you think about success. Often, doing my art the best and equating that with any kind of financial success are just - they're just wildly at odds with one another. SEYMOUR BERNSTEIN: Of course they are. HAWKE: And so... BERNSTEIN: They can even get in the way of one another. HAWKE: Yeah. So the most successful things I've done have been some of the worst things I've done. And sometimes I think that just playing life more beautifully is what I'm after, but I don't know how to do it. BERNSTEIN: But don't you do it through acting? HAWKE: Well, I don't know. Well, would you - I want to do it through acting. Yeah. GROSS: So are art and success getting closer for you with films like \"Boyhood,\" \"Blue Moon,\" the streaming series \"Reservation Dogs\" and \"The Lowdown,\" \"The Good Lord Bird\"? HAWKE: They are. And listening to it right now, I realized that that movie was kind of my midlife crisis. And, you know, I could really credit Seymour for redirecting my life, giving me permission to be the grown person I aspire to be, to give me permission to go after that. Some of the things you just mentioned are my favorite things I've done, and there has been more unity between myself and what I'm putting forth into the world in this period of my life. And I'd be lying if I didn't say, you know, that movie is also the first film I worked on with my wife. We started a little mom-and-pop production company, and something about working with her kind of united these disparate parts of my brain, where I wasn't compartmentalizing work and home life anymore, that they were becoming one thing. GROSS: I want to mention something that is also something that you mentioned to Seymour Bernstein, the pianist. You told him you had stage fright and talked to him a little bit about that. Under what circumstances did you have stage fright? Was it just literally on stage? 'Cause you've also done a lot of theater. Was it also on screen when you can, like, do a retake? HAWKE: Because of his warmth, I felt unashamed to say to him, what do you do about stage fright? Because I was about 40. I'd been a child actor, and I had so much confidence about acting. And both on film and on stage, I was having anxiety attacks and panic attacks, and I really had no mechanisms to deal with it or understand it. And this man just smiled at me and looked at me really intensely, and he said, oh, this is very good. This is very exciting. You're about to have a breakthrough. And I was like, what do you mean? And he's like, well, you're finally understanding and respecting you should be nervous. Your anxiety is your friend. Let it be your friend. This is guiding you towards excellence. And you don't need to see this as a problem at all. And he was very profound about loving yourself and making friends with your demons and being proud of the fact that you care. GROSS: But you said you thought when you had that stage fright, that you were going to die. Why was it death that you thought would be the final symptom of stage fright, as opposed to just humiliation and never working again? HAWKE: Well, that's a very interesting question, and that really is the essence of why I think I wanted to play \"Blue Moon.\" When your entire self-worth is wrapped up in your work - that was the real struggle. I didn't have any self-worth besides my work. And so it was death. If I went out on stage at Lincoln Center, a place that I have the utmost respect for and an establishment that I view as significant, if I humiliate myself performing the greatest writer in the English language, William Shakespeare, then I'm not an actor. And if I'm not an actor, then I'm dead. I don't have - I'm not anybody. That was the way my thinking was at the time, so of course I'd be scared. And so I needed to start rooting self-worth. It wasn't just about being an actor, you know? And I felt that way very much, I think, when I read the script for \"Blue Moon.\" Oh, wow, Larry Hart. If he doesn't have his music, he's nothing. He's absolutely nothing. He's a ghost. He's dead. If he cannot save his work, then he's gone. And no wonder you'd start to hit the bottle, and you'd hit it hard. GROSS: And he literally died several months after. HAWKE: Yeah, he did. GROSS: You tell a story - and I think it's in John Lahr's profile of you in The New Yorker - about how one of the ways you overcame the stage fright was the story of when you screamed on stage. Would you tell that story? I'll preface this with a story that Seymour Bernstein told you about a violinist he knows, who was afraid he'd drop his bow during a performance. HAWKE: Yes, exactly. GROSS: And he conquered that fear by intentionally dropping it during a performance, and it didn't ruin his life. HAWKE: Yeah. And I think the story that I told John Lahr must have been - I had an incredible moment on stage. So I'm out on stage, and I'm doing this monologue. And I just kind of decide to take a moment and look out at the audience, and I saw my director. I made eye contact with him, Jack O'Brien, and I admire him wildly. He's a genius theater director. And then I looked to the left, and there was Tom Stoppard, just one of my favorite human beings on the planet Earth. And I was thinking to myself, what an amazing moment this is to be in the Lincoln Center with these people I wildly admire. And I knew it was one of the last times I was going to be doing the show. It was certainly the last time they would be there. And I was having this kind of wonderful moment. I realized I had no idea where I was in the monologue. But I couldn't remember if I'd begun the monologue or whether I was finished with the monologue or if I was in the middle of it. And I just completely froze. And finally, I just screamed. I mean, I really did not know what else to do. And I went into the monologue from the beginning. And like a hurricane, I went into it, and I came off stage just wildly embarrassed. I was like, what happened? What happened? And after the show, Stoppard told me, it was wonderful the way you started again. I was like, well, it wasn't really wonderful. I mean, it might have come across that way, but it - and I started realizing that if you are actually in the moment, you actually can't do anything wrong. You really can't. It's going to be fine 'cause you're going to be living. And it's this desire to be perfect that's stifling. GROSS: But getting out of the moment and thinking about who was in the audience, that made you lose your train of thought as your character. That's what made you freak out where you were in the monologue, right? HAWKE: Exactly, yeah. GROSS: Yeah. Well, it's time to take another break, so let me reintroduce you. My guest is Ethan Hawke, and he stars in the new movie \"Blue Moon\" about Larry Hart, and he also stars in the new streaming series \"The Lowdown.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF STAN GETZ QUARTET'S \"THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Ethan Hawke. He stars as lyricist Lorenz Hart in the new movie \"Blue Moon\" and in Sterlin Harjo's FX streaming series \"The Lowdown.\" Hawke has directed several documentaries. The first was \"Seymour: An Introduction,\" about a brilliant pianist. When we left off, we were talking about a clip in that film, where Hawke asked Seymour for advice about his own career. So when you were talking to Seymour Bernstein about the second half of your life and what do you want from it, and you were saying, like, if I don't have, like, a religious calling and - yeah, and I was wondering, why did you mention religious calling? Did you ever think that is what you wanted? HAWKE: Yes. And I think I was - as a young person, I was thinking that a certain discipline, religious discipline could lend order to my life, you know, whether I loved a lot of the great Catholic writers, and I love a lot of the great Buddhist writers. And I was constantly hoping that their discipline could work for me and give me guidance and direction and orientation in my life. But I kept struggling with it, and I would struggle to stay on that path. And finally, it was my oldest daughter who realized, Dad, you got to stop struggling. You have your path. Your path is the arts, and your discipline has manifest in your life as an actor. That is your religious calling. That sounds pretentious perhaps on a radio show, but it's even true in a scary movie or in a silly noir set in Tulsa. You're celebrating people and life and humanity and what we're up against, and that has faith attached to it. GROSS: You were raised as Episcopalian. Your mother taught Sunday school. And you actually went on missions over the summer. And in an earlier interview we did, you described your missionary work not as proselytizing, but as, like, free labor... (LAUGHTER) GROSS: ...Helping people build latrines and build roofs. And you did that in Kentucky and West Virginia and the back hollows. And one summer, you went to Haiti and worked with Mother Teresa's order in the House of the Dying. Can you describe the House of the Dying? Like, what was that exactly? HAWKE: Well, it was during the, you know, AIDS crisis in Haiti in the late '80s. And the nuns, the order there, they would - they just had a home where you could die with peace and grace and dignity. And so men, mostly all men, could come and die and be bathed and clean. And it's very, very beautiful. And these women were incredibly dedicated to their faith and really inspiring. My mother was going through a phase where she was really worried I was turning into a superficial little snot who cared about, you know, whether his shirt was an Izod or Ralph Lauren or something like that. And so she took me there. She's a really inspiring and fascinating woman. Of course, when you're growing up, you don't see that. You just - you know, your parents are just your parents, and they're annoying. But her faith was very important to her, my father, too. And they gave me that, a longing for that. And they showed me how it can open up and deepen your life and give you something to live for that's bigger than, you know, your wants and needs and desires. And it lent itself to the life of artists - the life I've pursued - very well. GROSS: I want to talk with you about \"The Lowdown.\" I'm really enjoying this, and you play an investigative journalist for a kind of underground paper. I can't remember whether you correct the person as - whether he says it's a magazine. HAWKE: A long-form magazine. GROSS: Yes. HAWKE: A long-form magazine. GROSS: Yeah. He calls it a paper, and you say, no, it's a long-form magazine. And you are very, very eccentric. You investigate, like, power and corruption in Tulsa, where this is set. And you also break all the rules of journalism. You get beaten up a lot. And unlike, like, the tough guys in a lot of hard-boiled film noir and in novels, like, when you get beaten up, like, you hurt. And you're like - you're crying out in pain. HAWKE: I cry. Yeah, I know. GROSS: Yeah. Yeah. And so I want to play a short scene. This is toward the beginning of the first episode. So you're investigating a powerful, wealthy guy who runs an investment company, has been buying up a lot of Black-owned businesses, and you're wondering, like, what's this about? Tracy Letts plays that guy. You've walked into his office, dressed way too casually for a meeting like this, and you start looking around the room, picking up things, examining them, sniffing the carafe of brandy and being intentionally sarcastic and rude. So let's pick it up with the clip. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LOWDOWN\") TRACY LETTS: (As Frank Martin) Nice to meet you in person. HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) Yeah. LETTS: (As Frank Martin) We do have a lot of other business. HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) Yes. I'm sure you do. This place is so fancy. I've never even been back here. LETTS: (As Frank Martin) Well, yeah, just some of the perks. HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) Yeah, I should have gone in the investment firm business - huh? - instead of rare books. LETTS: (As Frank Martin) But you are a journalist, too, though, right? Or some kind of writer? HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I'm a truthstorian (ph). LETTS: (As Frank Martin) Sorry, say again? HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I am a Tulsa truthstorian. LETTS: (As Frank Martin) A truthstorian. What exactly is a truthstorian? HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I'm glad you asked. I read stuff. I research stuff. I drive around, and I find stuff. Then I write about stuff. Some people care. Some people don't. I'm chronically unemployed, always broke. Let's just say that I am obsessed with the truth. LETTS: (As Frank Martin) How about that? GROSS: So, Ethan Hawke, the series is inspired by film noir, but it's also kind of a satire of the genre. Your character talks tough, but, as I said, gets beaten up a lot. Are you a fan of noir novels? You know, hard-boiled novels or film noir? HAWKE: I am. I love it. I mean, I'll never forget the first time I saw \"Chinatown\" or \"The Long Goodbye\" or \"The Big Lebowski,\" for that matter, or some of the other Philip Marlowe - Bogart. You know, I love all that stuff. And, you know, one of the things I love about genre films is you can use the genre to be entertaining, and you can fill the story up with substance and message and ideas. But it's still entertaining because you're inside this genre. GROSS: So what was your take on this character? Like, what did you model him on? HAWKE: I loved this character. It's been a funny year for me because \"Blue Moon\" is probably the most different I've ever pushed myself outside the framework of my own identity. And then \"The Lowdown\" is just - I just relate to Lee. He's Quixote chasing windmills and running into propellers. He's a dreamer and an idealist and self-centered and doesn't see his own blind spots, and he's a moron, and I just completely relate to him. And he can say the right thing all the time and do the wrong thing all the time. And out of that, obviously comes a lot of humor. I kind of saw Lee as a guy who's frozen in 1996 or something. GROSS: (Laughter). HAWKE: I'm still wearing the same pants I wore back then. I got the same belt buckle I wore back then. He's still listening to the same music he listened to back then. And I admire him. And I also identify with his shortcomings. And Sterlin is really fun to work with. I had a great time on \"Reservation Dogs.\" We got along like a house on fire, and I can't remember a time I just ran with the character like I did with this one. GROSS: Well, it's time to take another break. So let me reintroduce you. My guest is Ethan Hawke, and he stars in the new movie \"Blue Moon\" about Larry Hart, and he also stars in the new streaming series \"The Lowdown.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MOLLY LEWIS' \"THE FORGOTTEN EDGE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Ethan Hawke. He stars in \"Blue Moon\" about Larry Hart and also in the new streaming series \"The Lowdown.\" You've done several movies about music. You have a new documentary that hasn't come out yet about Merle Haggard. You did a documentary about the pianist Seymour Bernstein. You played Chet Baker in a theatrical film, and... HAWKE: I made the film \"Blaze.\" GROSS: Yes... HAWKE: Blaze Foley. GROSS: ...About Blaze Foley. Yeah. So, when did you become really interested in music, and were you ever in a band? HAWKE: I don't remember life without music. My father's a great pianist, and I'm... GROSS: Oh, what kind of music does he play? HAWKE: Well, when I was little, he used to play a lot of Scott Joplin, and I loved to lay under the piano and listen to him play these rags. And I don't know why, but music has always been that place I go to. I don't know, you put on a good record, and everything is fine. Everything's going to be OK. And I also think that I love acting. Acting is my job, and to understand acting, I've gotten into directing, and to understand acting, I've gotten into writing. But music's one thing I can't really do. I mean, I try, but I'm not good at it at all, but I love it. And my inability to do it well has only increased my fandom, my geekdom, my absolute hero worship of the people who can do it well. And I think I really love being a fan. GROSS: Why did Merle Haggard make such a good subject for a documentary? HAWKE: Well, it was coming up on the last presidential election, and I had this realization that no matter who won, half the country was going to be absolutely despondent. And I found myself thinking a lot about Merle Haggard and how much he crossed the boundaries between left and right and what a free thinker he was. You know, he spent the first nine years of his professional stardom as the new Woody Guthrie. And then he wrote this funny song called \"Okie From Muskogee\" that was basically a really, really funny song asking the left wing to consider how the right wing might feel. And the left wing responded with absolute vehemence and felt betrayed and were angry at him. And then he was claimed by Nixon and touted as the, you know, voice of the silent majority. And then he went on and wrote songs about civil rights that weren't released and promoted because the label weren't excited by that, or they were worried he was going to lose fans. And he wrote pro-immigration songs, and those were ignored. And then, slowly, the right wing lost interest in him as their spokesperson. And he just was always himself. And he didn't follow anyone else's bandwagon. And he was a humanist. And I thought he might be a great person to revisit right now as our country is so kind of team-oriented and not speaking to each other. And that was the pull. GROSS: So... HAWKE: Not to mention he's a genius songwriter, and he's one of the great American songwriters. And I feel that his star has been receding in popular culture, and I kind of wanted to remind everybody about what a legend he was. GROSS: Well, we should end with some music. Do you have a preference? HAWKE: You know, why don't we - why don't you pick your favorite version of \"My Funny Valentine\"? GROSS: Chet Baker. HAWKE: Let's do Chet because that song has been following me my whole life. GROSS: Why? HAWKE: I don't know, it just has. We listened to it while we were writing \"Before Sunrise,\" and then I played Chet Baker, and then now I'm playing Lorenz Hart. And this song even makes an appearance in \"The Lowdown.\" So it's...

regional nerves in an already tense year \n       \n  Analysis by Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:21 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a bustling  Delhi  neighborhood, forensics teams combed through the charred skeleton of a car. Less than 24 hours later, the air outside  Islamabad’s  judicial complex was thick with the aftermath of a suicide bomb.\n \n\n   \n  The two deadly attacks are separate, and no evidence currently links the two. But for the two South Asian rivals, the political shockwave caused by the blasts are a stark reminder of the  lingering security issues  that fester below the surface throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  Explosions in their heavily fortified capitals are a rarity, and two in as many days have put officials in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan on edge, potentially  reigniting a cycle  of suspicion and blame after what has already been a tense year for all countries.\n \n\n   \n  A suicide bombing in Islamabad on Tuesday killed at least 12 people and injured 20 more, marking the deadliest such attack to strike the Pakistani capital in nearly two decades. It came just a day after a rare car explosion tore through a historic Delhi neighborhood, killing at least 10 and leaving more than a dozen wounded.\n \n\n   \n  The twin tragedies have handed political hardliners in both New Delhi and Islamabad a potent weapon, ratcheting up domestic pressure on each government to act decisively.\n \n\n   \n  The blame game ignited almost immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, without providing evidence, accused “Indian terrorist proxies” for the Islamabad attack, claiming it was “backed by India” from Afghan soil. New Delhi fired back, rejecting the “baseless and unfounded allegations” as “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the Delhi blast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring “all those responsible… to justice.” On Wednesday, the Indian government  called  the explosion a “terrorist incident,” which was “perpetrated by anti-national forces.”\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi has not named Pakistan in connection with the explosion, and authorities have so far remained tight lipped as to who they believe might be responsible. But in past attacks, India has frequently  pointed the finger  at Islamabad, which is what makes this week’s twin attacks potentially fraught.\n \n\n   \n  “We are witnessing an increasingly fragile security environment across South Asia,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “South Asia cannot afford further confrontation; the region is being held together by fragile ceasefires with no long-term resolution. What’s needed now is restraint, reflection, and a commitment to reset the regional course toward stability.”\n \n\n   \n    Secure capitals\n \n\n   \n  While both India and Pakistan have historically faced significant security threats, their capitals are meant to be fortresses – home to the seats of government, military leadership, and the diplomatic corps.\n \n\n   \n  In Delhi, the attack struck near the iconic Red Fort, a landmark and tourist hub teeming with crowded bazaars and street vendors. It came hours after police found thousands of kilograms of explosives from a village in Faridabad, a city just outside New Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Faridabad police official confirmed to CNN that police are investigating whether the recovery of these explosives was linked to the Red Fort blast. Police in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been conducting a joint operation across these states, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Modi has  built his brand  on a muscular national security policy, casting himself as the nation’s “watchman” and opposition politicians immediately seized on the alleged security lapse.\n \n\n   \n  “If the country is not safe… if the people are not safe… Questions will be asked,” Supriya Shrinate, a national spokesperson for the Indian National Congress, told local news agency ANI. She criticized the prime minister for traveling to Bhutan a day after the attack. “People… are starting to feel that the country is not in strong hands,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Across the border in Islamabad, the explosion occurred in the parking lot of the judicial complex, an area situated within a district that is home to numerous high-ranking government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan experiences chronic instability at the hands of militants, but Islamabad rarely witnesses such attacks thanks to a heavy security presence with Tuesday’s explosion being the deadliest to strike the capital since 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been carrying a heavy burden and a great distress in my mind,” advocate Jaseem Ahmed Bhutto, who witnessed the attack, told Reuters. “It’s a sense of confusion and concern that if the courts, where every ordinary and prominent person goes and where cases are resolved, are not safe, then who is safe in this city?”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP) behind some of the country’s deadliest attacks over the past decade, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement seen by CNN. The TTP, however, distanced itself, according to its spokesman Mohammad Khursasani.\n \n\n   \n  The bombing prompted a furious response from the government. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif declared a “state of war” and described the attack as a “wake-up call” regarding Afghanistan – a reference to Pakistan’s allegation that militant safe havens on Afghan soil are the source of its problems.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in militant violence since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021, fueling cross-border tensions that recently erupted into the  worst clashes  the two countries have seen in years.   Recent talks  in Qatar and Istanbul aimed at ending the latest cross-border fighting in have made little progress.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban have denied backing the Pakistani Taliban and expressed “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding Tuesday’s attack in Islamabad.\n \n\n   \n  According to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, this year “has been particularly bad” for Pakistan and Afghanistan, “not just in terms of the loss of life of Pakistani soldiers, but many officer ranked personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  This, he noted, is something “the political and military leadership in Pakistan has taken very seriously.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A moment of great volatility’\n \n\n   \n  The cycle of accusations and hyperbole following attacks in India and Pakistan is a well-documented political pattern. And while this rhetoric serves both government’s political needs, it also has the potential to push the countries into dangerous standoffs.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s attacks come “in a moment of great churn and volatility in South Asia,” according to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.\n \n\n   \n  With Pakistan blaming Taliban-backed militants it sees as being   sponsored by India, the situation could escalate, he said. “We’re looking at a potential crisis that could engulf not two but three countries of South Asia: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India,” Kugelman added.\n \n\n   \n  This blame game is fueled by deep-seated narratives on both sides.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Pakistan has accused India of sponsoring terrorism on its soil, claiming that Indian intelligence uses Afghanistan as a base to support anti-Pakistan militants like the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, India has long accused Pakistan of supporting and harboring militants that carry out attacks. Both sides deny each other’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s blaming of India for Tuesday’s suicide attack comes just months after the two nuclear-armed rivals engaged in their most intense fighting in decades: a  four-day conflict  in May featuring clashes with fighter jets, missiles, and drones.\n \n\n   \n  That deadly conflict was  triggered by a massacre  at a scenic mountain spot in India-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Following a familiar script, India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied. Modi  redefined  India’s policy on terrorism in the aftermath, which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered “an act of war.” New Delhi launched airstrikes against its neighbor, which prompted a swift military retaliation from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  According to Humayun, many in Pakistan might have been watching the aftermath of the Delhi blast with “bated breath,” anxious to see if the familiar finger-pointing from India would begin. He highlighted the initial “restraint on the Indian side” as a departure from that script.\n \n\n   \n  But if the Indian government suggests the blast was a terrorist attack, “the public will likely expect something big in response from the Indian government,” Kugelman said. “That said, I don’t think there will be as much pressure on New Delhi.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s principal counter-terrorism body, the National Investigation Agency, has taken over the probe.\n \n\n   \n  As governments separately attempt to get to the bottom of both attacks, the citizens of Delhi and Islamabad are left cleaning up the debris and mourning their dead.\n \n\n   \n  Both capitals had, for years, been largely “insulated from these kinds of incidents,” Humayun said.\n \n\n   \n  That they can now occur in these cities suggest that this type of vulnerability “is no longer just a symptom of the hinterland. It’s coming to major metropolises.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607812","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00-05:00","title":"The government shutdown is over, but not everything is back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has ended after 43 days, with President Trump signing a bill passed by Congress on November 13, 2025.

government shutdown is over, but not everything is back to normal \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Updated Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 2:00 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The  longest government shutdown  in U.S. history is officially over after President  Trump signed a bill  passed by Congress on Wednesday night. The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS). There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30. Here's a look at where things stand for now. Keep scrolling for updates, and jump by category here: Federal workers  |  SNAP |  Smithsonian  |  Air travel  |  National parks  |  Taxes  |  Economic data Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay  Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed. Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday. \"Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner\" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a  Wednesday memo . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The timing of backpay is a different question. After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress  passed a law  ensuring back pay for federal workers \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\" But Trump appeared to  suggest otherwise  in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were  paused by a federal judge , and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January. Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an  Instagram video  that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days. \"Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,\" he says of the last shutdown. \"A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.\" SNAP is back  The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026. The program, which some  42 million Americans rely on  for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and  extended that pause again  on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight). At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as  NPR has reported , many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again. Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual. Its  website says  the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday. All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved  live animal cams  — will reopen to the public \"on a rolling basis\" by Monday. Air travel won't bounce back overnight The shutdown snarled air travel in a tangle that experts say is beyond a quick fix. Escalating shortages of air traffic controllers — who have been required to work without pay — caused delays and disruptions at airports nationwide since early October. Then, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to  reduce air traffic  at 40 of the country's busiest airports, starting by 4% and ramping up to 10% by this Friday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The FAA  announced Wednesday  that it would freeze flight reductions at the current 6% level, citing a rapid improvement in controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers will get a lump sum payment equal to 70% of their  back pay within 48 hours  of the shutdown ending. The agency says it will continue to assess \"whether the system can gradually return to normal operations.\" Airlines and aviation regulators have warned that flight  disruptions are likely to continue  once the government reopens. Airlines had to adjust their schedules to reduce flights, and those changes can take time to reverse. \"It's going to take a bit to unwind, and the responsibility is not going to fall completely on the air traffic control operation,\" former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt  told NPR's  All Things Considered  on Tuesday. \"A good deal of responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying.\" Air travel experts have told NPR that even after the shutdown, lingering impacts could potentially complicate  Thanksgiving travel  — which is always a hectic time to fly. National Parks start to \"pick up the pieces\"     Most national parks  stayed at least partially open  during the shutdown, but with significantly reduced staffing (since thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed) and limited services like visitor centers and trash pickup. The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit that advocates for national parks,  said in a statement  that it could take months for returning staff to address the damage. \"For 43 days, many national parks were left open, vulnerable and unprotected,\" said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA. \"The National Park Service, already pushed to its breaking point after losing 25% of permanent staff, is left to pick up the pieces.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       National parks were already feeling the strain before the shutdown,  forced by federal funding cuts  to cancel ranger programs, close visitors centers and pause maintenance and research. During the shutdown, parks were unable to collect millions of dollars in entrance and recreational fees, which Brengel says could delay construction projects and other visitor services. And nonprofits which diverted resources to help parks stay operational have depleted their budgets in the process, Brengel says, leaving them \"unsure if they will ever fully recover those funds.\" Congress' bill funds the National Park Service through January. But Brengel calls it \"only a short-term reprieve,\" warning that another government shutdown could dampen the busy season by affecting the hiring of seasonal rangers for next spring and summer. The IRS is looking ahead to tax filing season The IRS  furloughed nearly half  of its approximately 74,000 workers and tried to lay off  roughly 1,400 others  — though those cuts were reversed as a result of the bill reopening the government. The agency's operations were  limited during the shutdown . It generally did not pay tax refunds during this period, scaled back its live telephone customer service supports, closed walk-in Taxpayer Assistance Centers and cancelled appointments related to cases with the Independent Office of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate Service — which it says will be rescheduled once the government reopens. Tax deadlines and laws remain in effect, and the IRS says it has continued critical operations related to next year's tax-filing season. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But some experts worry that the effects of the shutdown — on top of thousands of  IRS job cuts  enacted earlier this year — could make for a messy 2026 tax season. In an  October letter  to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) urged the IRS to take steps like pausing notice and collection activities during the shutdown. It wrote that since taxpayers can only respond to those by mail, the understaffed agency may not see their letters in time to fix errors or address issues — and will have to deal with an unwieldy backlog when the government reopens. \"This burden has the real potential to delay the 2026 filing season due to the increased stresses to our entire tax system,\" the accountants wrote. Such disruptions have happened before. The 2018-2019 shutdown left the IRS with over 5 million pieces of unprocessed mail, 80,000 unaddressed responses to Fiscal Year 2018 Earned Income Tax Credit audits and 87,000 amended returns waiting to be processed,  according to a report  by the National Taxpayer Advocate (an independent agency within the IRS). And years earlier, the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 delayed billions of dollars of tax refunds and created a backlog of 1.2 million income and Social Security number verification requests, according to the  Committee for a Responsible Budget . Delayed economic reports may never be released The shutdown could leave permanent gaps in economic data. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases employment reports on the first Friday of each month, a practice that was paused in October and November. Even with the government reopening, their future is uncertain. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt  told reporters  on Wednesday that October's inflation and jobs reports will \"likely never [be] released and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired.\" She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said \"may have permanently damaged the federal statistical system.\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not commented publicly on the status of the reports or updated its calendar of upcoming release dates. Economists  expect the bureau  to release its September jobs report (which was nearly ready when the government shut down on Oct. 1) first, and say it's an open question when — or whether — any October reports will be published. \n         \n         Correction \n         Nov. 13th, 2025 \n         An earlier version of this story featured a photo with incorrect caption information.

country is moving away from oil. Here's how it's going \n         By Julia Simon \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 1:12 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea. A few years ago , oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there. It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last. Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2023, Petro pledged to  stop approving new exploration contracts  for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step. Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going? When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil. But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says  Ana Carolina González Espinosa ,  senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says. \"I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,\" she says. \"But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.\" \"It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,\" she says. Why Colombia is doing this Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy. Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector. But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to  a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes . The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050. Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says  Guy Edwards , who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop. \" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,\" González Espinosa says, \"then we are going to be in trouble.\" Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol. The year before Petro took office, the company  acquired an electricity transmission company . In recent years, they've acquired more  solar  and  wind projects . And they're investing in  geothermal energy , drilling deep into the earth to create electricity. \"The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,\" Lemos says, \"but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.\" \"We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.\" Renewable progress and failures A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro. Solar made up around  9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024 , according to data from XM,  Colombia's electricity market operator . That's up from  roughly 1.5% in 2022 . Petro's government has introduced something called \"energy communities,\" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract  international financing  for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently  streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar  making it more efficient, says  Manuel Schulte , chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy. But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says. Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors  have given up on renewable projects ,  particularly wind projects . The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has  acquired some of these abandoned wind projects . Losing the messaging fight Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the \"myth,\" she says, that the country's energy transition \"will be an economic hindrance.\" \" The opposite,\" Muhamad says. \"What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.\" Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press.  His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines  have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as \"disastrous for the Colombian economy.\" Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels. \" They didn't resonate with the national audience,\" González Espinosa says in an email. \"It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.\" Looking to the future  Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote. As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal,  Estefanny Pardo , mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it. \"The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,\" Pardo says in Spanish. An upcoming conference Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023. Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production. Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels. If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through. \"Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   This week, world leaders are in Brazil for the annual U.N. climate conference to talk about how to cut planet-heating emissions. Scientists say a key way is for some fossil fuel-producing countries to stop exploring for new fossil fuels. One country's government decided to do just that - Colombia. NPR's Julia Simon went there to learn more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In a fishing village on Colombia's Caribbean coast, music plays in cafes lining the beach. It is cooler by the sea, where the wind blows through the trees. Out past the fishing boats, out in the turquoise sea, oil companies found deep water natural gas and planned to drill gas wells there. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, wants those wells to be among the country's last. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers, and President Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on climate change. Two years ago, at the U.N. climate conference, Petro took the stage and said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT GUSTAVO PETRO: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: \"Colombia,\" he says, \"has stopped signing exploration contracts for coal, oil and gas.\" This was a big deal. Stopping new exploration for fossil fuels is a key way to transition away from fossil fuels. Now the question is, how is Colombia's energy transition playing out? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: OK. To find out, I went to a leafy neighborhood in central Bogota, in the high-rise office of Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol. There I met... JULIAN LEMOS: Julian Lemos. SIMON: ...Corporate vice president of strategy and new business. Lemos says the oil company is diversifying. Ecopetrol has acquired an electricity transmission company, more solar and wind projects, and they're investing in geothermal, drilling deep into the Earth to create electricity. LEMOS: The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company, but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power transmission. SIMON: Energy experts say this isn't just a good move for the climate. It's a good move for Colombia's economy. Colombia has manufacturing, tourism and agriculture, but the government is still very reliant on the oil and coal sectors for revenues. Ana Carolina Gonzalez Espinosa, at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute, says as Colombia's oil reserves shrink and demand for oil and coal eventually fall, that will be a problem. ANA CAROLINA GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: If we don't think about how we'll diversify the economy, then we are going to be in trouble. SIMON: Key to diversifying the energy sector is solar and wind. Solar, in particular, is growing - both large-scale and small-scale projects for communities lacking electricity. But the sector has problems too. In some parts of Colombia, the grid still isn't big enough to handle all the new solar and wind. Many projects are on land belonging to Indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve them in planning, says Margarita Nieves, a renewable energy researcher. She says some renewable developers have left. MARGARITA NIEVES: Each project has its own challenges. SIMON: Petro's term ends in 2026, and that raises another question. Will his energy policies outlast him? Petro's government hasn't awarded new licenses to explore for fossil fuels, but this isn't signed into law. A new, right-wing government could change gears and bring in more companies to explore for coal, oil and gas. So is Colombia's energy transition story a happy one? Gonzalez Espinosa has thoughts. GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: It is not a happy story. It is not a sad story. It's just a real story. SIMON: Julia Simon, NPR News, Bogota, Colombia.

given to immigrants \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 4:38 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday. The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns. \"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\" Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV. Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement. \"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns. Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply. The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days. Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after. Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97432","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:15:00-05:00","title":"Why Kindness Matters: A World Kindness Day Reflection","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the profound impact of small acts of kindness on individuals and society, using personal and scientific stories to demonstrate that kindness is both emotionally and socially contagious.

We wanted to share that kind thought with you because today, November 13, is \"World Kindness Day\" — created back in 1998 by a consortium of kindhearted charities. If you're going to celebrate, say organizers, you should do at least one intentional act of kindness. (I don't think it counts if you're kind to yourself, although honestly, it can't hurt!) For us at Goats and Soda, in addition to sharing a kind thought with our devoted readers, we thought, this is a good opportunity to learn more about kindness — and to find out how acts of kindness can change lives. That's especially critical in a world where cruelty, war and bad news seem omnipresent. Some hardhearted souls may even question whether small acts of kindness really matter. Spoiler alert: They do! So … kindly stick with us as we explore … kindness. Let's start with a simple yet profound story about a snack. Back in 2004,  Maymunah Yusuf Kadiri , a neuro-psychiatrist and mental health advocate in Nigeria, was a young doctor working in the emergency room at the Lagos State University Teaching hospital. One night sticks in her mind. It was chaos. There were accident victims everywhere. She recalls the blood, the cries and her own exhaustion. \"I hadn't eaten for over 12 hours, and my hands were shaking,\" says Kadiri, who was 28 at the time. \"Then an elderly cleaner, one of those invisible heroes in hospitals, walked up to me with a small nylon bag.\" Inside was a biscuit and a sachet of water. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"you need small strength to save people.\" \"It sounds simple, but I'll never forget it. That biscuit tasted like hope. Her kindness reminded me that healing isn't only about medicine, it's about humanity,\" says Kadiri. \"As a psychiatrist, I've seen it over and over: People don't just heal in hospitals, they heal in human connections.\" And while one isolated act of kindness may seem random, it can lead to much more. Huguette Diakabana  remembers when she had to drop out of school at age 10 — until a mysterious donor came to her rescue. Her family was planning to emigrate to the U.S. from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and couldn't afford school fees. They figured she'd make up the year later. She had a different idea: \"I put on my previous year's uniform and sat outside under the street window of my would-be classroom.\" One day, the director invited her inside. Diakabana realized someone must have paid her school fees, but who?  Returning to the school years later, Diakabana discovered it was a school guard. She wanted to repay him. \"He told me to help others when I could, so I launched a scholarship program,\" says Diakabana, who now lives in Switzerland and is co-founder of The Luminous Agency, which focuses on digital literacy. Dr. Junaid Nabi, a physician-scientist who conducts research in health care technology at the RAND School in Washington, D.C. and is a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute, says he's come to realize that kindness isn't actually a trickle in the ocean. An act of kindness is more like dropping a stone that creates expanding ripples,   he says .  \"There are  studies  that illustrate how kindness spreads through social networks in measurable ways. When we are kind to someone, they don't just feel better — they become 25% more likely to help others.\" One such investigation described how kindness can be contagious. It was sparked by reports of an outbreak of kindness on a cold December morning in 2012. A stranger picked up the tab for the coffee order of the next customer in the drive-through line at a Tim Hortons coffeehouse in Winnipeg, Canada. And that customer picked up the tab of the person behind him. In the end, 226 customers passed on this act of kindness. The study authors, citing other examples of \"pay it forward\" kindness at fast food restaurants and their own experiments encouraging subjects to help others, write: \"Why, in the absence of external sanctions and opportunities for reciprocation, do people help strangers? One possible explanation is that helping is driven by receiving or observing help. In other words, generosity towards strangers may be socially contagious.\" Says Nabi: Your kindness influences a friend, who influences their friend, who influences their friend. \"This creates what is often termed as ' social contagion. '\" It's like a positive feedback loop, Nabi says: Feeling cared for makes you want to care for others. The 2025 World Happiness  Report  surveyed people from 147 countries. Interviewees spoke a simple truth: Doing something kind with no motive for gain made them feel better.   Nature or nurture? And where does kindness come from? Are you born with it? Or can you learn to be compassionate and empathetic? Jeff R. Temple , a professor and psychologist with UTHealth Houston, says kindness is a central thread running through his studies on healthy relationships among adolescents and young adults. \"In our intervention work — including with the  Fourth R program  and other school-based curricula — we teach adolescents to practice perspective-taking, to express care even during disagreement and recognize the impact of their words and actions. These are essentially the behavioral expressions of kindness.\" Such kids are less likely to bully others because they know what healthy relationships are like, he says. A ripple effect And let's not forget that kindness can change not only the life of the recipient of the kind deed but of the kind person, says Nabi, who offers this anecdote. In the 2013   Savar building collapse  in Bangladesh, where 1,040 garment workers were crushed under concrete. Rescue workers managed to pull out 2,400 people from the rubble two weeks after the collapse. Nabi arrived at the disaster site as a Red Cross volunteer, expecting to gain experience in trauma care. Instead, he says, the experience changed his psyche, teaching him about the nature of true kindness. \"In the midst of chaos, with bodies awaiting identification, kindness came down to being present during others' darkest moments,\" says Nabi. \"I performed CPR on workers I knew wouldn't survive. and when I couldn't save someone, I stayed by their side, holding their hand.\" \"Before Savar, I was mechanistic, rushing through clinical work like tasks,\" he recalls. \"The  image of workers who had embraced each other  as concrete crushed them — that final act of human kindness in the face of death — shattered my callousness completely.\" When he returned to the hospital, he listened to patients differently, giving them more of his time. He also urges doctors to volunteer for humanitarian causes to practice compassion. \"Kindness, I learned, is about showing up completely for another person's suffering,\" Navi reflects, \"and letting that experience fundamentally change who you are.\" So if you began reading this story with the thought that World Kindness Day is … a gimmick … it is a gimmick imbued with heart and hope.  It's a good reminder to practice kindness more, Dr. Kadiri says. \"And here's the beautiful part: When someone receives kindness, they don't just feel better, they become better.\" They may be inspired to perform their own act of kindness. And that, she says, makes the world a kinder, better place too. Your turn:  Readers! Have you ever had a life-changing moment because of an act of kindness.

Last year’s ceremony was held in Miami, where the Latin Recording Academy is headquartered.\n \n\n   \n  The Latin Grammys will broadcast live on TelevisaUnivision’s US platforms – Univision, UNIMÁS, ViX and Galavisión – beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An hourlong pre-show will begin at 7 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Like the  Grammys , the majority of the Latin Grammys are handed out during the Latin Grammy Premiere ceremony, which precedes the telecast.\n \n\n   \n    Who is performing at the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n   Bad Bunny , CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso, Karol G, Marco Antonio Solís, Chuwi, Fuerza Regida and its singer Jesús Ortiz Paz will all perform.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s not all: Pepe Aguilar, Aitana, Ivan Cornejo, DannyLux, Gloria Estefan, Kakalo, Carín León, Liniker, Morat and Los Tigres del Norte will also hit the stage, as well as the Latin Grammy’s 2025 Person of the Year, Raphael.\n \n\n   \n    Who is hosting the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic duo of Maluma and actor, producer and musician Roselyn Sánchez will host. This marks Sánchez’s eighth time hosting the awards.\n \n\n   \n    What’s new at the 2025 Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  There is a new field in 2025, for visual media, and two new categories: music for visual media and roots song.\n \n\n   \n  The former will recognize original music for movies, TV shows, video games and other visual media. For a project to participate in this category, it must feature Latin rhythms or be composed by someone of Ibero American descent.\n \n\n   \n  The roots award will go to the songwriters of new, unpublished recordings that reflect the traditions and roots of various communities, cultures, or social groups, especially those of Hispanic American origin, whether in Spanish, Portuguese or Indigenous languages or dialects.\n \n\n   \n  The best urban/urban fusion performance category also has a new name, and its criteria has also changed. Now, remixes are eligible only if the original version of the song was released within the same eligibility year.

The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\" He kept his word but   tensions were high when members returned this week. \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\" After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in. \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\" Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks. \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.   But  Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office  throughout the shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\" Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of  Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year  – the crux of the shutdown itself. \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\" Other GOP members, like  Missouri Rep. Mark Alford , said the time back home was useful. \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\" Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place. \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas. She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat   Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown. Grijalva told NPR's  All Things Considered   she thinks her support of the  effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files  played a role in her wait to get seated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I really like this lady. She's going to be an excellent member of Congress,\" Speaker Johnson  said   after he swore Grijalva in . \"We followed the custom of the House on the timetable and we've had a little, as we say in the deep South, some intense fellowship about that. But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\" Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month. \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\" Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\" Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that. \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\" Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills. \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   The House of Representatives came back for one day this week after being gone for more than 50. During the government shutdown, the House was officially out of session. Some members did town halls back in their districts. Others came to the Capitol anyway. But as NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports, there was angst on all sides when everyone reassembled. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: The House Rules Committee met earlier this week ahead of the full House coming back into session on Wednesday. And let's just say things were tense. Here's Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the panel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM MCGOVERN: Long time no see. I hardly recognize you guys. Where the hell have you been? SPRUNT: After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx stepped in. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VIRGINIA FOXX: I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. YASSAMIN ANSARI: That's exactly what happened. FOXX: I worked every day. I don't know about you. ANSARI: I worked every single day as well. FOXX: But I don't want to hear another soul say that. ANSARI: We all worked every single... SPRUNT: The House passed its version of a stopgap funding bill in mid-September. House Speaker Mike Johnson then sent lawmakers home. He was asked on the third day of the shutdown, why not stay? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: My quick answer's very simple. The House did its job. SPRUNT: Then he blamed Democratic leaders in the Senate for not doing theirs. Leadership on both sides of the aisle held press conferences almost every day of the shutdown, but there were no votes, no committee hearings. Wednesday was the first official day back in 54 days. KEVIN KILEY: It's a lot more crowded here. You know, the halls have been pretty lonely. SPRUNT: That's California Republican Kevin Kiley. He kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown. KILEY: To be honest with you, this has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering. SPRUNT: He said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Those subsidies were central to the shutdown. KILEY: That was, I guess, one advantage of being here is that we - I have had some constructive conversations like that. But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having this sort of consensus-building process that you need to pass legislation like this. SPRUNT: Fellow Republican Mark Alford of Missouri said the time back home was useful. MARK ALFORD: Look, I've been here for three years. I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been there. I've been able to visit farms. We went to businesses. We visited 14 of 18 rural hospitals in our district. And it gave us a real clear picture where America stands right now and what we can do to help. SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the House was even sent home at all. JULIE JOHNSON: This was a ridiculous thing. SPRUNT: That's Julie Johnson, a freshman Democrat from Texas. J JOHNSON: I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment, and it was disrespectful to the body. And then the speaker refusing to swear in a dully elected, that was poor form. SPRUNT: She's referring to Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in mid-September but wasn't sworn in until yesterday before any votes. The common refrain from Democrats, like New Mexico's Melanie Stansbury, is this. MELANIE STANSBURY: The House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on, and we should have been here the entire time. SPRUNT: Republican Steve Womack of Arkansas says he agrees with that. STEVE WOMACK: Listen, I didn't want to go home in August. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just - that's just more than America should have to put up with. SPRUNT: He's a senior appropriator, and he's now looking down the road at what lies ahead. WOMACK: We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days. We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll. SPRUNT: Funding for much of the government will run out again January 30.

13, 2025 • 3:17 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — With the federal government  open for business  again, air traffic controllers can finally get paid for all the work they performed during the 43 days of the shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says that will happen promptly, with controllers receiving the bulk of their back pay within days. But some air traffic controllers  have not forgotten  the last government shutdown in 2018 and 2019, when dozens of controllers sued the federal government for overtime and other compensation they said they were owed. That lawsuit eventually resulted in a settlement, but it took years. One current air traffic controller told NPR they didn't receive a check from that agreement until this year — just weeks before the government shutdown once again in October. \"I just got a $400 check, just, like, maybe a week before the shutdown, that was from that 2019 shutdown,\" said a controller who handles high-altitude traffic at a facility in the Midwest. He asked NPR to withhold his name because he's afraid of retaliation from the Federal Aviation Administration. This controller says the FAA did a poor job of tracking overtime and shift differentials during the prior shutdown, and he's dreading the task of calculating how much he is owed this time. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's just a nightmare,\" the controller said, \"trying to make sure we get paid back correctly for all of our differentials and overtime.\" In remarks this week, Secretary Duffy described a much speedier process for controllers to get their back pay this time around. \"In this package to reopen the government, our controllers could be paid within 48 hours of the government opening,\" Duffy told reporters in Wisconsin on Tuesday. \"They'll get a big lump sum of what they're due, which is helpful. They don't have to wait another two weeks to be paid.\" Air traffic controllers missed two full paychecks over the last six weeks, as well as part of a third. Duffy said this week that controllers would receive 70% of their pay within 48 hours of the government reopening, with the remaining 30% about a week after the first payment. \"So I encourage all of them to come to work to be patriots and help navigate the airspace effectively for the American people,\" Duffy said  at a press conference  Tuesday in Chicago. Still, some controllers are wary. \"On the last one, we weren't properly paid out,\" said one current controller who works arriving and departing traffic at a major U.S. airport, who also asked NPR not to use his name out of fear of retaliation from the FAA. \"Our pay has all these differentials and adjustments in it. Overtime, night pay, Sunday pay, training pay, all different kinds of stuff that you can get,\" the controller said. \"So I sat and I calculated for the whole 35-day shutdown what that should work out to. And I had to do that all by hand, which, you know, sucked.\" \"I wasn't made whole until May, and the shutdown ended in January,\" the controller said. Some controllers had to wait even longer. Dozens of controllers  sued in 2019 , alleging that the government withheld overtime and other pay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, even to this date, have not received any payment for overtime work they performed during the FAA's lapse in appropriations,\" lawyers for the controllers wrote. The Trump administration fought in court to have the case dismissed, but that motion was denied. The parties eventually agreed to a settlement earlier this year. The National Association of Air Traffic Controllers, the union that represents those controllers, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The union referred questions about the most recent shutdown to the FAA. NPR asked the Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Transportation to explain how controllers would receive the back pay they are currently owed, but neither agency responded. However Secretary Duffy has expressed support for the idea of paying a $10,000 bonus to air traffic controllers who worked through the recent shutdown, a proposal first floated by President Trump in  a Truth Social post  on Monday. \"The air traffic controllers who didn't miss a day, they came for every scheduled shift that they had, they should get a bonus,\" Duffy said Tuesday in Chicago. \"President Trump, brilliant!,\" Duffy said. \"We are going to pay them a bonus that'll be $10,000. Depending on how many we have, they should come to the White House, and he should present them with their checks.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Ailsa Chang in Culver City, California. SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   And I'm Scott Detrow in Washington, where the federal government has reopened, but that does not mean everything is back to normal. Consider the U.S. air travel system - temporary flight reductions are still in place at dozens of airports across the country, and aviation regulators have not said when they'll lift. NPR transportation correspondent Joel Rose joins us now with more. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. DETROW: What's the latest on these restrictions? ROSE: Aviation officials said last night that these temporary flight reductions will stay at 6% instead of ramping up to 10% as they were scheduled to do. The Federal Aviation Administration says these cuts were necessary to keep the airspace safe as the agency grappled with a staffing shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Those air traffic controllers, of course, have been working without pay during the shutdown. Some took on second jobs, and many called out sick. Over this past weekend, the FAA reported staffing shortages at dozens of facilities at once, leading to some of the worst delays of the entire shutdown. This week, the number of staffing shortages declined sharply to just a handful over the past few days, and that gave regulators some confidence that more controllers are coming to work. But they say they will not lift these reductions completely until the safety data improves. DETROW: Given that, how quickly do we think airlines will be able to get back to their regular schedules? ROSE: Airlines seem pretty confident that they can ramp up quickly, I mean, once the air traffic control situation is stabilized, maybe within just a few days of getting the word from the FAA. Chris Sununu is the CEO of Airlines for America, the industry trade group. He addressed this question on a call with reporters yesterday. Here's some of what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS SUNUNU: You got to make sure the airlines are repositioning their assets, right? 'Cause it's not just canceling one flight. Canceling one flight has a domino effect. They've had to move different actual airplanes in untraditional ways, staffing, logistics. So there's a lot of pieces that have to kind of line up here. ROSE: Sununu says it might take about a week for airlines to get back to full pre-shutdown normal, as he put it. But he is optimistic that they can get there before the Thanksgiving holiday rush that begins in earnest next week. DETROW: Let's talk about air traffic controllers. This had been a focus during the shutdown. It's obviously a very stressful and important job. Any sense when they will get paid for all the work they did? ROSE: Yeah. They missed two full paychecks and part of a third. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said this week they would get paid quickly once the government reopened. Duffy said they would get the bulk of their money - about 70% - within 48 hours and the rest within another week. But some air traffic controllers remember that this is not how it went last time. They say the FAA made a lot of errors after the last government shutdown in 2018 and 2019 and did not pay some of what controllers say they were owed in overtime and shift differentials. Some controllers actually sued the federal government for that compensation that they said was missing. The case eventually settled just this year. So it took over five years for some of them to be made whole. And I've spoken to several controllers who say they are wary of something like that happening again. DETROW: Now, President Trump floated the idea of a $10,000 bonus for people who worked all of their schedule shifts during the shutdown. Any word on whether that's a real thing? ROSE: Secretary Duffy was asked about that earlier this week, and he said he supports the idea. He called it brilliant. And depending on how many controllers there are who qualify, Duffy said they should come to the White House so that the president could present them with their checks in person. I asked for details on how these bonuses might work from both the FAA and the Department of Transportation. So far, no response from either. DETROW: That is NPR's Joel Rose. Thank you so much.

The bill passed Wednesday night   despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats   joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York. Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209. President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.  \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\" In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a  court battle  because of the shutdown. The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs. But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown —  extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year  — is not addressed in the bill. Instead, as part of the  deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators , Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies. That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure. Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. A lot of pain, not a lot of gain Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception. The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown  in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government. With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table. But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government. In the meantime,  42 million Americans who participate with SNAP  didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's  order to scale back flights . Millions of federal workers went without pay. The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient. Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care. \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\" Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he  took a step back  during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who  repeatedly   asked   where   Trump  \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions. What happens now?  Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year. Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage. If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year. Some Republicans have shown  interest  in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps. And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604788","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"SNAP Funding Pause to Soon End, but Anxiety and Anger May Linger","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The end of a 12-day government shutdown in November 2025 led to the restoration of SNAP benefits for 42 million Americans, but the temporary suspension raised serious concerns.

soon be restored after a nearly two week halt. But suspending funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, may have long-lasting impacts, say some experts and those who depend on the program to feed their families.     \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Jacqueline Giammona, a single working mom of two boys, relies on SNAP for most of her groceries. By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.   The Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court. \"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\" Giammona   can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences. \"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said. SNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need. Funded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University. \"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said.   \"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden randomly gave benefits \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\" In late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments. Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\" \"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said. The administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would   cover roughly half  of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.   The deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic. \"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\" Ideally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown. \"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026. \" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some advocates also worry the SNAP disruption will dissuade people who face hunger from getting help.   \"By making SNAP payments uncertain the shutdown will likely further decrease the number of eligible people who will apply,\" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit Hunger Free America. The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment about concerns over mistrust in the program   and plans to address that. The weeks of hardship, anxiety and chaos caused by the funding pause have, however, shined a light on the importance of the program, many noted. SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from  both major parties .   \"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen. Brittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them. Jansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her partner racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends part-time, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care for their two toddlers. Her own mother didn't fully grasp the struggle. \"When I first told her that we were getting benefits she was confused,\" Jansen said, \"because she was like, 'Well, you both have jobs!'\" Since the shutdown and SNAP funding pause, Jansen has been more open about the fact that her family needs help. \"And I think people are just kind of surprised,\" she said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   The end of the nation's longest government shutdown means food assistance for 42 million people will soon be restored. But anxiety from the 12-day funding pause may stick around, as NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Jacqueline Giammona is a single, working mom of two boys and buys most of her groceries with SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Last weekend, she was thrilled when California, where she lives, sent out full benefits right after a court ordered the federal government to pay them. JACQUELINE GIAMMONA: I was really relieved, but I do have something that's like, OK, what if they take it away? LUDDEN: The Trump administration battled that order all the way to the Supreme Court. Giammona can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food and considers it an abuse of power. GIAMMONA: People are going to distrust the government, and I think people are going to be really angry about it for a long time. LUDDEN: SNAP serves 1 in 8 people in this country, most at or just over the poverty level. It's supposed to be there for anyone who qualifies, and it's never been disrupted before in its six-decade history, says economist Craig Gundersen at Baylor University. CRAIG GUNDERSEN: So in that sense, this is a big surprise. It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern. LUDDEN: The administration argued it could not use reserve funds to pay for SNAP during the shutdown. But President Trump repeatedly criticized SNAP as a, quote, \"Democrat program,\" and Republicans have long tried to shrink it. At the White House last week, Trump falsely claimed President Biden expanded SNAP randomly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: During Biden, they gave it to anybody that wanted it. I think it's something you have to talk about because the numbers are incredible. LUDDEN: Crystal FitzSimons with the Food Research & Action Center says targeting SNAP was a policy choice. CRYSTAL FITZSIMONS: It does make me nervous that this could be used as a negotiating tactic again. Once you break a taboo - right? - it's that much easier to break a taboo. LUDDEN: The congressional deal to reopen the government funds SNAP through next September. FitzSimons would like lawmakers to make sure benefits won't ever be held up again. FITZSIMONS: Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could. I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before October 1, 2026. LUDDEN: The Agriculture Department did not respond to NPR's request for comment about these concerns. For all the hardship and anxiety of the past couple weeks, anti-hunger experts like Gundersen say there may be an upside. GUNDERSEN: If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status. LUDDEN: In Phoenix, Brittany Jansen agrees. I caught her at snack time for her two toddlers. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Blah (ph). BRITTANY JANSEN: Yes. Hang one second. Sorry. LUDDEN: Jansen applied for SNAP 10 months ago after she and her partner racked up thousands in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care. She says even her mother was surprised they signed up for food aid. JANSEN: I mean, when I first told her that we were getting benefits, she was confused because she was like, well, you both have jobs. LUDDEN: Jansen hopes the more people learn about SNAP, the more it will change misperceptions about who gets it and why. JANSEN: I think maybe everybody hopefully has somebody in their life that is affected by this, and it can, you know, kind of make it a little more personal. LUDDEN: That's why she started talking more openly about how SNAP is helping her own family at a tough time.

That figure includes roughly $3.4 million from the Smithsonian's gift shops, concessions and IMAX film screenings and, for the National Gallery of Art, \"an estimated 334,000 visitors, including 11,700 schoolchildren, and an estimated $1.2 million in gross revenue from its shops and restaurants,\" according to a September report from the group. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We're glad to see these museums are able to reopen, but we know from past shutdowns that cultural institutions lose millions in revenue they can never recover,\" said Marilyn Jackson, president and CEO of the American Alliance of Museums in an email to NPR, \"And it's not just the museums but the restaurants, hotels, and small businesses that depend on cultural tourism who suffer alongside them.\" Here's a roundup: Smithsonian Institution The Smithsonian, which includes 21 museums and the National Zoo, will reopen on a \"rolling basis.\" Beginning Friday, Nov. 14, the National Museum of American History, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Steven F.

But for how long? \n         By Cory Turner \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 3:19 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The  deal Congress reached  to re-open the federal government requires the Trump administration to reinstate federal workers who were fired in October, including those charged with overseeing the nation's special education laws. But it's not clear how long they'll be back. As NPR has reported , the Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) inside the U.S. Department of Education is the central nervous system for programs that support students with disabilities. It not only offers guidance to families but also oversees state compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). OSERS can't do its job without staff, and, according to  a new Education Department filing , the office lost 121 of its 135 employees in the October reduction-in-force. That matters because, while Wednesday's funding agreement will return those workers to \"employment status\" as of Sept. 30, there appears to be little protecting them after Jan. 30, when that provision expires. \"We are concerned special education will cease to exist,\" says Jacqueline Rodriguez, CEO of the National Center for Learning Disabilities .   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Education Department did not answer specific questions from NPR about whether workers who were cut in October would be allowed to resume their work, as opposed to being put on administrative leave, or if the department would try to fire them again after the deal expires. The department offered only this statement: \"The Department has brought back staff that were impacted by the Schumer Shutdown. The Department will follow all applicable laws.\" If OSERS stays a shadow of its former self, Rodriguez says, \"the only conclusion that we can draw is that it is an intentional dismantling of the entire system of special education .\"  The Office for Civil Rights has also seen big cuts Another Education Department office that supports students with disabilities was also decimated by the October cuts. Families often turn to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) when they fear their child has been illegally denied special education services. But the Education Department's recent court filing shows the extent of the administration's efforts to gut that office: OCR lost 299 staffers after the March reduction-in-force but, because of a lawsuit, most (247) remain on temporary, paid administrative leave. Another 137 were cut in the October reduction-in-force, which has been  paused by a federal judge . Under the new government funding agreement, those 137 staffers should be reinstated, at least until Jan. 30. By the department's own numbers, that means just 62 staffers of OCR's current 446 employees have not received RIF notices. That's roughly 10% of the office's  600-plus headcount in January , when the second Trump administration began. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       OCR and OSERS are both mandated by  federal law . \"I've got to say, I'm just shocked that they can destroy an entire unit of an organization that's created by statute ,\"  said R. Shep Melnick, a professor of American politics at Boston College who has been writing about OCR for decades. If the office is not returned to previous staffing levels, with at least enough attorneys to field and investigate individual discrimination complaints from families, Melnick says OCR \"will have to reinvent itself. And I fear it's going to reinvent itself in a way that it will just be a political arm of the administration. \" In spite of these staff cuts, the administration  has aggressively used OCR  to enforce its new interpretations of civil rights laws, going after school districts and colleges that continue to provide protections for transgender students or embrace diversity, equity and inclusion. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5442506","dateOfPublication":"2025-08-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"If compliments make you feel super awkward, this comic is for you","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the psychological impact of receiving compliments, drawing on insights from social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao.

PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Fans tired of waiting for the next  Frozen  sequel or the next chapter in the  Star Wars  saga may soon have new ways to engage with those worlds — by creating their own content using Disney's IP. That was the tantalizing hint Disney CEO Bob Iger dropped during an  earnings call  Thursday, as he described how the company is exploring ways to make the Disney+ subscription-based streaming service more interactive, and customizable for users. While Iger stopped short of making any formal announcements, he suggested Disney is in discussions with artificial intelligence companies about tools that could allow subscribers to generate and share their own content built from Disney-owned stories. \"AI is going to give us the ability to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content,\" Iger said. Disney+ declined to offer additional details about what form these new creative tools might take or which tech companies were involved in the negotiations. Meanwhile, AI remains a concern in many parts of the entertainment industry, with many companies including Disney  engaged in lawsuits  against AI players for copyright infringement. Iger acknowledged this tension. On the earnings call, the CEO said the company's conversations with potential AI partners are focused on enabling new forms of fan engagement  and  guarding against uses that could dilute or misuse Disney IP. \"It's obviously imperative for us to protect our IP with this new technology,\" Iger said. The trend towards increased interactivity  Disney isn't alone in trying to rethink the boundaries between audiences and the entertainment they consume. At the recent  TechCrunch Disrupt  conference in San Francisco, Netflix's chief technology officer, Elizabeth Stone,  offered  her own look at a future shaped by deeper user engagement. \"The future of entertainment is likely to be even more personalized, even more interactive, even more immersive,\" Stone said during an on-stage conversation with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos. In addition to games and social media videos, one of Netflix's most talked-about experiments in this direction arrives next year: Stone said viewers of the classic talent competition  Star Search   reboot  will be able to cast votes directly from their TVs or phones, influencing which contestants advance – or do not. Younger audiences and deal-making climate drive quest for interactivity This engagement layer sits on top of Netflix's vast library of films and TV series. But platform leaders increasingly see passive watching as only part of the picture. Younger audiences, especially Gen Z, are gravitating toward spaces where they can participate, remix and respond rather than simply watch. According to Deloitte's 2025 Digital Media Trends  survey , more than half of Gen Z respondents say social media content feels more relevant to them than traditional TV shows and movies. The research also points to the growing popularity of indie creators, and a change in consumer expectations around quality: Content doesn't always have to be polished to be extremely popular, as some of the most-watched feeds on YouTube and TikTok prove. At the same time, despite ongoing litigation, entertainment corporations are starting to get comfortable with the idea of  licensing content  to AI companies. One of the most high-profile in recent weeks is the licensing  partnership  between Universal Music Group and the AI music creation platform Udio. \"It shows that the AI companies can work with the creative community to come up with models that work for both of them,\" Copyright Alliance CEO Keith Kupferschmid told NPR regarding this particular deal. \"And I think we're going to start seeing more and more deals come through because they realize they can do this and do it the right way.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   OK. Movie fans who are impatient for, say, the release of \"Frozen 3\" or the next installment of the \"Star Wars\" franchise might soon be able to create their own mini versions. At least that's what Disney's CEO Bob Iger hinted at on an earnings call today. Here to talk about it is NPR's Chloe Veltman. Hi, Chloe. CHLOE VELTMAN, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: Wait, so what's going on here? What did Iger say exactly? VELTMAN: Well, I mean, to be clear, the Disney CEO didn't make any firm announcements today. But he did talk about a few interesting ideas the company's exploring, including potentially collaborating with AI companies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB IGER: AI is going to give us the ability to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content. VELTMAN: Now, Iger didn't elaborate on exactly what this user-generated content might look like, and Disney+ did not supply more details via email when I wrote to them. But Iger says it would give Disney+ consumers the opportunity to create content and share it with others. CHANG: Wait, I just - I'm trying to picture this. So are, like, tons of \"Toy Story\" and \"Iron Man\" mashups going to be coming to our screen soon? Like, I mean, how will Disney stop misuses of its intellectual property? VELTMAN: Well, Ailsa, it's probably going to be a balancing act. Iger said the talks Disney has been having with these AI companies are focused both on looking for ways to use the technologies to create more consumer engagement, at the same time, it's important that they protect the value of the company's IP. And Ailsa, Disney isn't the only company thinking about ways to make content more interactive using new technologies. CHANG: Oh, really? What else are you seeing out there? VELTMAN: Well, I attended the TechCrunch startup conference in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, and there was quite a bit of talk about this. Here's Netflix's chief technology officer, Elizabeth Stone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH STONE: The future of entertainment is likely to be even more personalized, even more interactive, even more immersive. CHANG: Interactive - so what does Stone say about how this future content might look? VELTMAN: She said several things, but one thing that really is capturing a lot of attention, including mine, she said Netflix users will be able to interact with the upcoming reboot of the \"Star Search\" talent show when it launches next year. CHANG: (Laughter) OK. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STONE: So if you're sitting at home watching \"Star Search\" on your TV, you'll be able to, either on the TV or your mobile phone, actually put in a vote that advances or doesn't advance some of the contestants on the show. VELTMAN: Yeah, neat, huh? CHANG: Yeah, I guess. VELTMAN: Yeah, this, of course, is all in addition to the standard movie and TV watching people do on the platform. CHANG: Well, that's the thing, Chloe. I like regular old movies and TV shows. Aren't they enough? Like, why are companies, such as Disney and Netflix, so interested in moving towards interactivity? VELTMAN: Well, two words for you, Ailsa - Gen Z. User-generated content is huge with this demographic in particular. CHANG: Young people. VELTMAN: Young people. And according to Deloitte's 2025 Digital Media Trend survey, more than half of these people say it's - that this type of user-generated content is more relevant to them than traditional TV content like TV shows and movies. So yeah. And another reason is that entertainment companies are starting to get more comfortable with making deals with tech companies. CHANG: All right. That is NPR's Chloe Veltman. Thank you so much, Chloe. VELTMAN: Oh, pleasure, Ailsa. CHANG: And a note that Walt Disney Pictures is a financial supporter of NPR.

Instead of immediately seeking out extra-cushioned footwear or super-specialized shoe inserts, start with some foot exercises, says  Irene Davis , a professor of physical therapy and rehab sciences at the University of South Florida. \"People have these amazing muscles in their feet,\" Davis says. \"They actually have the ability to increase the strength and capacity of their feet, which can help with the pain.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In fact, regularly exercising your feet and ankles has been shown to reduce the risk of injury, prevent and alleviate pain and improve overall foot health, says  Dr. Adam Tenforde , an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.  Foot care experts share six exercises to try at home. Whether you're gearing up for that big soccer game, recuperating from a long day at work or just want the strongest feet possible to avoid trips and falls in the future, give them all a try or start with just one. Consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions, experience pain or have preexisting foot conditions like bunions, plantar fasciitis or achilles tendonitis. Exercise 1: Foot doming This exercise is like doing crunches for your feet. It targets your \"foot core,\" the muscles that work together to stabilize the foot for dynamic movement, Davis says. In the same way core exercises like planks or mountain climbers are important for total body movement, strengthening your foot core provides stability so the larger muscles that move the foot and ankle can do their job and protect against pain and injury, Davis says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       How to do it:  Start in a seated position, Tenforde says. Ground both the heels and the toes while pulling back the ball of the foot to raise your arch. Once raised, squeeze the arch muscles for a few seconds. Hold for two to three seconds for 10 repetitions to start. Once you've got the hang of it, try the same exercise standing, then slowly move up to 20- to 30-second holds for three to five repetitions to build endurance, Tenforde says. Foot doming can be practiced daily. Incorporate it into everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or waiting in line at the grocery store, he says. Exercise 2: Wall stretches This exercise can be effective for pain relief and increasing blood flow to your feet, says podiatrist  Ebonie Vincent . It's especially helpful if you suffer from plantar fasciitis. How to do it:  Stand up facing a wall. Then, wedge the toes of one foot against the wall, with the foot at about a 45-degree angle, keeping the heel on the ground. Place your hands on the wall for support if needed. Slowly begin to bend the knee of that elevated foot and bring your body forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your calf and the bottom of your foot. Vincent suggests holding the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeating three times on each side, up to three times a day. Exercise 3: Toe spreads Did you know you have the ability to spread out your toes as wide as you can spread out your fingers? If that idea seems wild, it's probably because for many people the range of motion in the toes has been limited by a lifetime of toe-constraining footwear, Davis says. The lateral stretching of toe spread exercises can help improve your flexibility and motor control, protect against bunion pain and increase foot stability, Tenforde says. How to do it:  Spread your toes as wide as possible and then bring them back to   a neutral position. To isolate the correct muscles, it's best not to flex or extend your toes as you go, Davis says. If you find that tough, try using toe separators, the kind you might use while getting a pedicure. Simply squeeze your toes against them for a few seconds, then stretch as far outside of them as you can for another few seconds. Try two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions   daily. Don't be discouraged if you have limited mobility at first, says Tenforde. Over time, your muscles should get stronger and you should be able to stretch wider. Exercise 4: Toe Yoga  Don't worry, no miniature yoga mat required here. But like other yoga practices, toe yoga — or toe-ga, as Davis and Tenforde call it — can improve your balance and foot stability by strengthening a number of your toe muscles. Strong toes are important for the \"push-off\" function needed to walk or run, among other things, Davis says. How to do it:  Stand with your feet on the floor and lift up your big toe while keeping your lesser toes on the ground. Then, raise your lesser toes while keeping your big toe on the ground. Do two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions daily, Tenforde says. Exercise 5: Calf raises  Yep, they're not just for rounding out leg day at the gym. Since they mimic the propulsive phase of walking or running, Tenforde says calf raises are great for strengthening the stabilizing muscles and ligaments of the foot and ankle. But take care: while it might look easy, this exercise is often done wrong, he says. How to do it:  To get the most out of a calf raise, slowly rise up onto the front of your foot by activating your arch and lifting your heel as high as is comfortable. Then, use those same muscles of your arch and big toe to slowly lower the heel back down to the ground. It's common to roll to the lesser toes and the outside of the foot on your way down, but that works the wrong muscles and can lead to injury, Tenforde says. Once you've got the right mechanics down, aim for two to three sets of 10-15 reps every other day. Start with double leg calf raises and then move to single leg if you're up for a challenge, Tenforde says. Exercise 6: Hold hands with your feet This one is more of a stretch to warm up or cool down — and will make your feet feel happy, says orthopedic surgeon  Dr. Erica Rowe Urquhart . How to do it:  Sit in a comfortable seated position. Interlace the fingers of one hand with the toes of the opposite foot and gently massage the bottom of your feet with the thumb of your free hand. Then, gently rotate the foot and ankle to help loosen any tension in the foot and lubricate your joints, she says. By spending just a few minutes holding hands with each foot at the beginning and end of each day, you can prepare your feet for all the work they'll be doing — and then thank them for all the weight they carried throughout the day. And we could all stand to show our feet a little more care and gratitude, Urquhart says. This story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

Prince Andrew was drawn into the news surrounding sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he sought to distance himself from the scandal. “I can’t take any more of this,” a sender identified in Epstein’s contacts as “The Duke” wrote to him in 2011, in one of thousands of partly redacted emails released Wednesday . Fourteen years later, the former Duke of York has been stripped of all his titles, including the princeship bestowed at birth. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — as he’s now known — was royally demoted two weeks ago by his brother, King Charles III, and faces eviction from the mansion where he’s lived rent-free near Windsor Castle. But the bad news keeps coming for the man who was once second-in-line to the throne. The recent trove of documents has renewed the sexual assault allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor and undermined his denials that he ever met his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre . They also reveal some of the efforts made behind the scenes to attack her claims. Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II, has vehemently denied all allegations by Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year. But he did settle a lawsuit out of court that reportedly paid her millions of dollars.

The scandal, however, resurfaced in 2019 when Epstein was arrested for a second time on charges of sex trafficking. Giuffre said she was 17 when she was trafficked to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor. In a disastrous attempt to clear his name, Mountbatten-Windsor did an interview with the BBC in which he denied ever meeting Giuffre and said he broke off contact with Epstein in December 2010. He was widely criticized for showing no empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with Epstein. His downfall over the past month began when other emails showed his Epstein friendship lasted far longer than he disclosed. Those revelations were followed by the publication of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir last month that detailed the three times she said they had sex. The new emails undercut Mountbatten-Windsor’s claim that a now-infamous snapshot of him with his arm around Giuffre’s partly bare midriff was doctored because he couldn’t remember it being taken. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote in one 2011 email in which he called Giuffre a liar. Epstein repeatedly disparaged Giuffre, calling her “nothing more than a telephone answerer.” He discussed getting a reporter to investigate her, suggesting “Buckingham Palace would love it.” When the Mail on Sunday sought comment before publishing a story in March 2011 about Giuffre’s allegations, Epstein forwarded the email to a contact listed as “The Duke” that is partly redacted but appears to be Mountbatten-Windsor. “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” the reply from the email listed as “The Duke” said. “I can’t take any more of this (on) my end.” When he asked Epstein how he planned to respond to the tabloid’s request, Epstein said he wasn’t sure. “The only person she didn’t have sex with was Elvis,” he wrote."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/ammonia-gas-leak-oklahoma-81319108b4556f17a5a324f5f29be1f6","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:14:02+00:00","title":"Ammonia Gas Leak in Oklahoma Forces Evacuations, Treats Hundreds","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaking tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in Weatherford, Oklahoma, released a toxic gas that filled a hotel’s hallways, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate.

Several dozen people were treated at hospitals. Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak. An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor. Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said. AP AUDIO: Ammonia gas leak from a tanker truck in Oklahoma sickens dozens and forces evacuations AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on a toxic gas leak in Oklahoma. He took off running, but noticed his roommate wasn’t with him and saw that he had run for their trucks. He said a police officer managed to save his coworker. “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red. His skin was all red.” Related Stories Effects of failed Grand Slam Track league felt in different ways across world championships 5 MIN READ Johnson found one person stumbling and gave him a shirt to put over his mouth. At one point, he looked at the smoke and saw they were surrounded, thinking “We’re going to die.” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers. Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said. At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day. A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds (11,340 kilograms) of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes. Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago, five people died in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan. The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles (115 kilometers) west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said. “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials. The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.” The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said. Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard. Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety. Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said. Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part. I know it’s your house, but you really have to go.” ___ McCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire, and Brumfield reported from Cockeysville, Maryland.

wildfires or hurricanes \n         By Rebecca Hersher \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 5:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The storm blew into Cozad, Neb., in the wee hours of Saturday, June 29, 2024. The wind felt like a hurricane. The hail was the size of softballs. \"I was in the window, I was crying,\" remembers Soledad Avalos, who has lived with her husband in their home in Cozad for 35 years. \"Seeing all the damage [to] the cars and the house.\" When the sun came up, the extent of the damage became clear. Cozad is a small town of about 4,000 people, surrounded by corn fields. Crops were flattened. Virtually every vehicle parked outside that night had a broken windshield. Nearly every roof in town was leaking, or worse. Siding was missing, paint had been stripped away. The storm came from the northwest, and so nearly every northwest-facing window was cracked. Both the hospital and the school were in disrepair. \"Those softball-sized hail stones just punched a hole through the roof membrane, and water was just pouring through the ceiling like a waterfall, or a shower,\" says Robert Dyer, the CEO of the Cozad Community Health System, which runs Cozad Community Hospital, the only hospital in town. \"Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating.\" The hospital's emergency department had to shut down for several hours, and the building is still being repaired more than a year later. Hailstorms like the one that hit Cozad don't often make national headlines, because they are usually hyper-local events that hit just one town, or one neighborhood in a larger city. Most hailstorms don't cause enough damage to trigger federal disaster declarations, or make it onto official annual lists of major weather disasters. And they are generally less deadly than flash floods, hurricanes and wildfires. But extremely costly hailstorms are getting more likely in the United States, researchers warn. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a pool ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have  more frequent hail  as the planet warms up. That risk is driving up the cost of home insurance in the middle of the country, saddling average Americans with huge bills. Areas with the most hail risk are seeing some of the fastest growing home insurance prices in the U.S.,  according to  two landmark  federal reports  released in the last year. \"In the Midwest, you've seen a surprising increase in losses,\" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest property insurance trade group. \"It's particularly the hail, the wind. A lot of damage to roofs.\" That escalating damage is a reminder that, as climate change drives more extreme weather, geography is no longer a guarantee of protection from skyrocketing insurance rates. Home insurance costs are skyrocketing in the middle of the U.S. The central United States is home to the  worst hail risk  on the planet. \"North America is the hail continent,\" explains Scott St. George, a climate scientist and the head of weather and climate research at WTW, an international risk analysis company. And he says hail is different from other types of severe weather because it does a lot of property damage without causing many fatalities. \"It basically damages anything that's outside. And we've got a lot of stuff in the way,\" according to St. George. \"There are more houses insured, more expensive cars. Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors.\" That has led to enormous bills for property insurance companies. \"You've seen some really big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S.\" says St. George. Last summer's hailstorm in Cozad caused an estimated $100 million in property damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith – an enormous sum for a town of just 4,000 people. And, in 2024, hailstorms caused an  estimated $160 billion  in damage to homes nationwide, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. That figure doesn't even include storms that produced hail less than 2 inches in diameter, which can still cause widespread damage. With losses mounting, insurance companies have raised prices in recent years. Nationwide, the cost of insurance rose about 8% faster than inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a  major report  published by the Treasury Department in January.  The report found that the average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers in the Northern Plains paying about 20% more than the national average, and consumers in the Southern Plains paying more than 45% more. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance this year is nearly $6,400, according to  Bankrate . That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average. In September, the Treasury report was removed from the department's website by the Trump administration. The Treasury Department did not respond to questions from NPR about why it was removed. Hail risk is only one of many reasons that insurance is more expensive. The higher cost of labor, and of construction materials are also driving up insurance prices, says St. George. \"Insurance is very impacted by inflation,\" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. \"So if inflation suddenly spikes, then insurance losses go up.\" And the  cost of building materials  has increased even more than other goods in recent years, he points out. Insurance companies are bringing in profits. Small towns are struggling Rising prices for homeowners appear to be translating into profits for the industry. After losing more than $10 billion in 2023, the industry saw $26 billion in profits in 2024, according to credit agency AM Best. Insurers say that's largely due to the severity of disasters in a given year. \"It can be a dramatic swing because some years you have huge catastrophes,\" says Gordon. When insurers raise prices, they are simply passing along the enormous costs of rebuilding from major disasters, he says. But high prices are hitting many homeowners hard, particularly in places with historically low cost-of-living, like Nebraska. \"Insurance in our state really has skyrocketed the past several years,\" says Josh Tapio, an insurance broker at All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb. A few years ago, an average homeowner would pay about $1,500 per year to insure their $300,000 home, Tapio says. Now, it costs between $3,000 to $4,500, a two or even threefold increase. \"There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill and they see that it's double from what they paid last year,\" Tapio says. His office has never been busier, as people shop around for a policy they can afford. The high cost of insurance can make property ownership untenable. Before the storm, longtime Cozad resident Jennifer McKeone owned two rental houses in town. The hail caused extensive damage to both, and her insurance company refused to keep insuring them. \"I scrambled to find insurance, and the only insurance I could find was going to raise the rent to the point where I didn't think the people who lived in the houses could afford it,\" McKeone says. She ended up selling the homes, because neither she nor her tenants could afford the insurance costs. Seniors are hit particularly hard by rising insurance costs In the year and a half since the storm hit Cozad, most of the broken windows have been replaced, and most of the leaking roofs have been repaired. \"The town is doing well,\" says McKeone, who runs the Cozad Development Corporation, a local group that builds housing in town and works with businesses. But under the surface, McKeone says, many are still trying to finish repairs to their homes. Seniors have been hit particularly hard, she says. Many older residents live on a fixed income from a pension or social security payments, and can't afford drastically higher bills. Baltazar and Soledad Avalos, whose home was severely damaged in the storm, have experienced insurance problems firsthand. The home that they've lived in for 35 years had an insurance policy, but that policy didn't cover the full cost of all the repairs to the roof, windows and siding. Baltazar is still out on a ladder most days, fixing damage at age 72. On top of that, the cost of their insurance has gone up by about 10%, which is significant for a retirement-age couple. Baltazar is retired, Soledad is still working. Insurance is more expensive, and it covers less One of the biggest complaints among Cozad residents is that, even as they shell out more for property insurance, that insurance is covering less. Many people in town now have policies with higher deductibles, meaning that they need to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before the insurance kicks in. And many new policies also don't cover the full cost of replacing a damaged roof, which is often the most expensive repair after a hailstorm. Megan Fales has worked as an insurance agent in Cozad for more than a decade, and handles hundreds of home insurance policies in town. \"A lot of people have just gotten to the point where, like 'Let's just take a higher deductible,'\" she says, because it costs less each month, even though they agree to pay more for repairs if there's a future storm. She says many homeowners in the area hope to save money by doing repairs themselves, instead of relying on insurance to pay. Businesses in town are also paying more money for less coverage. After the storm destroyed the roof of the local hospital, the insurance company refused to renew the policy. The only policies available are more expensive, and also have a much higher deductible for the roof. That means the hospital must pay more each month for insurance, and also must keep more cash on hand in case there's another storm. In an effort to avoid catastrophic damage in future storms, the hospital's governing board chose to upgrade the building. Instead of simply replacing the damaged roof, they are investing in roof materials that can withstand high winds and small hail. That choice saved them money on their monthly insurance premium, Dyer says. But even with those savings, they are paying more money for less coverage, compared to two years ago. \"It's to a point of unsustainability,\" says Dyer. \"If we got hit by another storm right now, it would drain all our cash.\" NPR's Robert Benincasa contributed to this story. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Delegates from around the world, meeting at the annual United Nations climate conference, are talking about home insurance. Insurance is getting very expensive in large part because of extreme weather. In the U.S., insurance is especially high in coastal states with intense hurricanes and wildfires, and there is another hot spot at the very heart of the country. NPR's Rebecca Hersher takes us there. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: It's been nearly 18 months since a hailstorm damaged the only hospital in Cozad, Nebraska. Robert Dyer, the CEO of Cozad's Community Health System, walked me through the construction zone, where ceilings are still being repaired. ROBERT DYER: Softball-sized hailstones just punched a hole through the roof membrane. HERSHER: Water came pouring through those holes, he says. DYER: Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating. HERSHER: And it wasn't just the hospital that got hit hard. Robyn Geiser is the housing director for the local Cozad Development Corporation. ROBYN GEISER: It impacted houses, cars, businesses. If it was in the open, it was impacted. HERSHER: She says virtually every car in town had a cracked windshield. GEISER: Houses that - it shredded the vinyl siding. HERSHER: Even now, some houses in town look like they were sprayed with bullets. Double-paned windows have spidery patterns where one pane was shattered by the hailstones. One local insurance agent estimated the storm did $100 million in damage in a town of just 4,000 people, which means there were a lot of insurance claims. Massive insurance payments for hail are getting more common, says Scott St. George, a climate scientist at Willis Towers Watson, an international risk analysis company. SCOTT ST GEORGE: You've seen some big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S. HERSHER: He says the main reason is that there's more and more stuff in hail-prone parts of the country. ST GEORGE: Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors. You know, basically anything that's outside that's in the path of a hailstorm that's insured is very vulnerable to a lot of expensive repairs. HERSHER: In 2024, hailstorms caused an estimated $160 billion in insured damage to homes in the U.S., according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. Insurers have responded by raising the price of insurance in the middle of the country, where damaging hail is most common. More expensive building materials and labor have also driven up prices nationwide. The upshot is that the Great Plains now have some of the most expensive home insurance in the country, according to two recent federal reports, which means average homeowners there are struggling with huge bills. JOSH TAPIO: There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill from their company and they see that it's doubled from what they paid last year. HERSHER: Josh Tapio is an insurance agent in Omaha. TAPIO: It's just becoming unaffordable in our state, is the new reality. HERSHER: Tapio says he doesn't expect insurance prices to go down in the future. Insurance premiums have increased 40% nationwide in the last six years, according to Lending Tree, and the weather is only getting worse. The risk of hail in the central U.S. is increasing as the planet gets even warmer, which means this is just the beginning of the insurance affordability crisis in places like Cozad, Nebraska. The hospital in Cozad is dealing with the new reality head-on. CEO Robert Dyer says they're paying a lot more for insurance these days and getting a lot less coverage, which is frustrating, but also increasingly common for both businesses and homeowners. Dyer is proud of how the hospital is dealing with the financial stress of rising insurance costs and more hail risk. He brings me into the new front lobby of the hospital, where workers are sanding drywall and installing new wiring. DYER: We decided to try to turn lemons into lemonade. HERSHER: There's a brand-new roof above our heads. And that roof has something called hail board in it, a hard layer that can withstand big balls of ice. The hail board means the roof costs more, says Dyer, but he's hoping the investment is worth it. What would happen if... DYER: Another one. HERSHER: ...Another hailstorm like this happened next year? DYER: Well, I would hope, with the mitigation that we put in place, we wouldn't have catastrophic failure on our roof. HERSHER: The repairs would probably drain the hospital's cash, he says. It wouldn't be good, but it wouldn't shut the whole place down.

approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026. The complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump . It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who’s seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender. “California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.” Newsom spokesperson Brandon Richards said in a statement, “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.” The legal move against heavily Democratic California marks the first time the Justice Department has sued over a flurry of unusual, mid-decade House map revisions across the country that were drawn to maximize partisan advantage in advance of next year’s elections.

Building apartments near public transit could help address the housing crisis 6 MIN READ Three Republican-led states — Texas, along with Missouri and North Carolina — have not faced federal legal action after revamping district lines following Trump’s call for new maps to expand GOP numbers in the House. Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box. California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year’s midterm elections. The Justice Department is joining a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections. “Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 — the recent ballot initiative that junked California’s pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California’s congressional district lines,” the lawsuit says. Prop 50 was Newsom’s response to Trump’s maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line. Democrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber , which would imperil Trump’s agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans hold 219 seats, to Democrats’ 214. The showdown between the nation’s two most populous states has spread nationally, with Missouri , North Carolina and Ohio adopting new district lines that could provide a partisan advantage. Other states are considering similar moves. The national implications of California’s ballot measure were clear in both the money it attracted and the high-profile figures who became involved. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into the race, including a $5 million donation to opponents from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super political action committee tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it , while former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared in ads supporting it , calling it a “smart” approach to counter Republican moves aimed at safeguarding House control. The contest provided Newsom with a national platform and he has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028. ___ Richer reported from Chicago."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/duffy-newsom-commercial-drivers-license-immigrant-trucking-c0f3064e329a00f19aecbd1404dd393d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"22:00:46+00:00","title":"California to Revoke 17,000 Commercial Driver’s Licenses for Immigrants Amid Federal Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California has announced the revocation of 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants, after discovering that the licenses expired after the drivers lost legal status in the U.S. The action follows federal criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who accused California of improperly issuing licenses—especially in cases where work permits expired years ago—and threatened significant funding cuts.

to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday. The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public’s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people . Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California’s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver’s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns. “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we’ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,” Duffy said, referring to the state’s governor. “This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.” Related Stories Alex DeBrincat scores twice, Red Wings beat Ducks 6-3 to end 3-game slide 1 MIN READ Quinton Byfield scores in OT to lift the Kings past the Maple Leafs, 4-3 1 MIN READ No. 17 Michigan State beats San Jose State 79-60, sets up matchup with No. 9 Kentucky in New York 1 MIN READ Newsom’s office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Still, Newsom’s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement. “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” Richards said. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns. Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver’s licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state’s effort to comply. The new rules for commercial driver’s licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days. Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn’t have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver’s work permit expired — sometimes years after. Newsom’s office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens. ___ Associated Press writer Sophie Austin contributed to this report from Sacramento, California."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-thailand-border-shooting-ac8659b858329a4fb45e3649759cbeae","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"09:18:01+00:00","title":"Cambodia Evacuates Hundreds After Border Shooting, Tensions Rise with Thailand","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 13, 2025, Cambodia evacuated around 250 families from Prey Chan village in Banteay Meanchey province after a shooting incident involving a Cambodian man, Dy Nai, who was reportedly killed.

Wednesday’s shooting occurred two days after a Thai soldier lost a foot to a land mine while patrolling another area of the border. Thailand blamed Cambodia for the blast and announced it was suspending honoring the terms of a ceasefire partly brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Territorial disputes over exactly where the border lies between the Southeast Asian neighbors led to five days of armed conflict in late July that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians. But tensions remained high. Many terms of a more detailed truce agreement signed last month have not yet been implemented. A Cambodian man identified as Dy Nai was reportedly killed in shooting Wednesday, while three other people were wounded. About 250 families from Prey Chan village in Cambodia’s northwestern province of Banteay Meanchey, where the shooting took place, were evacuated to a Buddhist temple about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border, said Ly Sovannarith, the provincial vice governor.

The observer team included officials from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Wednesday called for an independent investigation into the incident to bring justice to those affected by the shooting.

Thailand said it would pause implementation of the agreement indefinitely. It also demanded that Cambodia apologize, conduct a thorough investigation and implement prevent such incidents in the future. Hun Manet said the shooting occurred after Thai forces engaged in “numerous provocative actions for many days with the objective of instigating confrontations.” He added that Cambodia would still honor the ceasefire terms. The Thai army alleged that Cambodian soldiers fired into a district in Thailand’s eastern province of Sa Kaeo, and that the Thai side “fired warning shots in response.” “Cambodia’s accusations that Thailand initiated fire, provoked conflict, and violated the ceasefire are entirely false. Cambodia’s firing from a civilian area as cover constitutes using human shields, violating humanitarian principles and demonstrating complete disregard for Cambodian civilian lives.” army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree said in a statement Wednesday. Thailand and Cambodia have a history of enmity going back centuries, when they were warring empires. Their competing territorial claims stem largely from a 1907 map drawn when Cambodia was under French colonial rule, which Thailand has argued is inaccurate. The International Court of Justice in 1962 awarded sovereignty to Cambodia over an area that included the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple, which still rankles many Thais.

Emails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Fannie Mae executives were unnerved about what one called the “very problematic” disclosure of data by Lauren Smith, the company’s head of marketing, who was acting on Pulte’s behalf. “Lauren, the information that was provided to Freddie Mac in this email is a problem,” Malloy Evans, senior vice president of Fannie Mae’s single-family mortgage division, wrote in an Oct. 11 email. “That is confidential, competitive information.” He also copied Fannie Mae’s CEO, Priscilla Almodovar, on the email, which bore the subject line: “As Per Director Pulte’s Ask.” Evans asked Fannie Mae’s top attorney “to weigh in on what, if any, steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves now.” While Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late last month, along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies. Housing industry rattled by dismissals The dismissals rattled the housing industry and drew condemnation from Democrats. It also gave Pulte’s critics evidence to support claims that he has leveraged the nonpublic information available to him to further his own political aims. “This is another example of Bill Pulte weaponizing his role to do Donald Trump’s bidding, instead of working to lower costs amidst a housing crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. “His behavior raises significant questions, and he needs to be brought in front of Congress to answer them.” The episode marks the latest example of Pulte using what is typically a low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy to enhance his own standing and gain the attention of President Trump. He’s prompted mortgage fraud investigations of prominent Democrats who are some of the president’s best known antagonists, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Rep. Eric Swalwell. In June, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal for the firms to accept cryptocurrency, another industry Trump has boosted, as part of the criteria for buying mortgages from banks. Last week, he persuaded Trump about the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building — a proposal that was widely criticized because it would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.

Pulte is also targeting the nation’s largest homebuilders Pulte also has focused on large home construction companies, which have drawn Trump’s ire. Pulte requested confidential Fannie Mae data and has publicly signaled that he is considering a crackdown if the companies do not increase construction volume. “I’m looking at the Fannie Mae builder data and with the top three homebuilders we buy EASILY over $20 billion in THEIR LOANS!” he posted to X in early October. In a brief statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, did not address questions from the AP, but said the agency “requires its regulated entities to carry out their operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” Fannie Mae said it takes “compliance with the law very seriously and we have a rigorous program to ensure we follow all laws and regulations.” Pulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment. Currying favor with the president Since his appointment to lead the FHFA, Pulte has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump. The 37-year-old scion of a homebuilding company fortune, Pulte has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-online millennial with a thirst for recognition and a desire to please the president. He and his wife also donated about $1 million to Trump’s campaign, campaign finance disclosures show. When Trump sought to oust Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Pulte became a leading attacker, routinely taking to X, formerly Twitter, where he has over 3 million followers, to excoriate the central bank leader. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that some Fannie Mae ethics and oversight officials who were fired last month had been investigating whether Pulte improperly obtained mortgage information for James, who was charged last month with bank fraud after Pulte sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department. She said the charges, which she denies, are politically motivated. Pulte’s power over the mortgage lending industry is unusual. Not long after his Senate confirmation, he appointed himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which hold trillions of dollars in assets. The companies serve as a crucial backstop for the home lending industry by buying up mortgages from individual lenders, which are packaged together and sold to investors. The three competing roles present the potential for a conflict of interest that is detailed in emails reviewed by AP. Like many matters of public policy in Trump’s Washington, it appears to have begun with a social media post. In October, Trump criticized the homebuilding industry, which he likened to the oil-market-dominating cartel OPEC. “They’re sitting on 2 million empty lots, A RECORD,” the president posted to his social media platform, Truth Social. “I’m asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to get Big Homebuilders going.” “On it,” Pulte posted in response on X. Sensitive data was gathered Pulte turned to Smith, who in her brief tenure at Fannie Mae had become a trusted Pulte ally whose work portfolio transcended the boundaries dividing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. Soon, a team at Fannie Mae was overseeing an effort to pull together a tranche of mortgage data, according to emails reviewed by the AP. Smith played a central role and shared the confidential lender-level pricing information with Freddie Mac, which set off alarms at both companies, according to the emails. A spokesman for Freddie Mac declined comment. In the Oct. 11 message to Smith, Evans, the Fannie Mae mortgage executive, also added others to the email chain because they “were involved with this week’s efforts to compile this information” and he wanted to “make sure you do not exacerbate this issue.” Danielle McCoy, Fannie Mae’s general counsel, weighed in, adding that the information Smith provided to Freddie Mac should “never be shared” and “could put the company at risk.” Others who were part of the email chain included Almodovar, the CEO; chief operating officer Peter Akwaboah; Devang Doshi, a senior vice president for capital markets; and John Roscoe, a Pulte loyalist and former Trump White House aide, who served as Fannie Mae’s executive vice president of public relations and operations. Days later, Almodovar, McCoy and Evans — who did not respond to requests for comment — were out of a job. Meanwhile, Roscoe was promoted to co-president of the company, while Akwaboah was named acting CEO. Pulte also got something he wanted. A day after the terse email exchange, Trump posted a graphic to his Truth Social network that featured Fannie Mae’s logo, a list of large homebuilders and the headline “We Give Them Billions.” Pulte quickly reposted it. ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed reporting."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/lamonica-mciver-new-jersey-immigration-newark-d681f7b3f76b235b24c785b3ab485b30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:47:54+00:00","title":"Judge Declines to Dismiss Criminal Charges Against Rep.

(AP) — A judge declined Thursday to throw out the criminal case against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting federal agents during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey. McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution. U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress. The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on another of one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges. McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong. “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.

McIver has pleaded not guilty and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision pending. McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison. Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring. McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened. Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest. It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident. A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped. Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill spelling out that authority. McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607015","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00-05:00","title":"Michael Jackson sets a record on the pop charts, thanks to spooky season","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the evolving impact of seasonal holidays on music charts, particularly during Halloween and early Christmas.

thanks to spooky season \n         By Stephen Thompson \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 11:36 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Once again,  Taylor Swift  tops this week's  Billboard  albums and singles charts. Elsewhere, two holidays collide, as Halloween perennials coexist with the charts' first flurries of the Christmas season. Along the way,  Michael Jackson 's \"Thriller\" shoots up the chart, making this the sixth consecutive decade in which Jackson has scored at least one top 10 hit. That's an all-time chart record. TOP STORY Before the streaming era, holidays rarely had much of an impact on  Billboard 's Hot 100 singles chart. You'd see an occasional novelty hit here and there, but generally speaking, the Hot 100 in December didn't look all that different from the Hot 100 in, say, March. The streaming era has changed that radically — and in ways that extend well beyond Christmas time. Just this year,  Toby Keith 's  35 Biggest Hits  compilation  zoomed back into the top 10  in the aftermath of July 4.  Earth, Wind & Fire 's  Greatest Hits   re-entered the  Billboard  200  albums chart because so many fans like to stream the group's 1978 song \"September\" — with its famous question, \"Do you remember the 21st night of September?\" — on Sept. 21. And Halloween? Well, Halloween has become a musical season unto itself — for at least a few weeks, anyway. Last week's charts reflect the seven days immediately before Halloween — the \"spooky season,\" you might say, but not the holiday itself or the weekend that followed. And several titles did re-enter the charts, led by Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" which resurfaced on the Hot 100 at No. 32. This week's charts cover a seven-day stretch beginning with Halloween, so you get a full reflection of costume-party playlists and titles streamed on front porches for the benefit of trick-or-treaters. And, though it can't compare to the annual pre-Christmas onslaught, a handful of spooky and spookiness-adjacent songs do make their way back onto the Hot 100 this week. The songs themselves are more or less exactly what you'd expect:  Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett  & The Crypt-Kickers' \"Monster Mash\" (No. 21), Ray Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" (No. 22) and Rockwell's \"Somebody's Watching Me\" (No. 24) all reemerge from their respective crypts in lockstep, with The Citizens of Halloween's \"This Is Halloween\" (from  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas ) right behind them. But one Halloween jam outshines them all — and hits some massive milestones in the process. \"Thriller\" was the seventh single from Jackson's 1982 mega-blockbuster of the same name and hit No. 4 during its initial chart run. It became a durable classic — and Halloween staple — thanks to  its iconic video , which premiered in December 1983. \"Thriller\" has re-entered the Hot 100 numerous times since then, most prominently in the aftermath of Jackson's death in 2009. This week, it jumps from No. 32 all the way to No. 10. For Jackson, that triggers a remarkable chart milestone: He's the first artist in history to hit the top 10 in  six different decades . Before, he was tied with … who,  The Beatles ? Nope.  Elvis Presley ? Nuh-uh. The answer is  Andy Williams , who had loads of hits in the '50s, '60s and '70s, then returned to the top 10 in the 2010s and 2020s thanks to the streaming-fueled holiday hit \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.\" In Jackson's case, his six decades have been consecutive — and there's even a seventh with an asterisk, because  The Jackson 5  cracked the top 10 with \"I Want You Back\" in December 1969. Prior to this week's \"Thriller\" renaissance, Jackson's last appearance in the top 10 arrived thanks to his posthumous appearance in  Drake 's 2018 hit \"Don't Matter to Me.\" Don't expect \"Thriller\" to remain in the top 10 now that Halloween is an increasingly distant memory. The spooky season is well and truly over, provided you don't look too closely at the Hot 100 and grimace in terror as you spy the song at No. 31. It's  Mariah Carey , who reenters the chart — earlier than ever — with \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Eeeeeeeeeeeek! TOP ALBUMS For the fifth straight week, Taylor Swift's  The Life of a Showgirl  sits atop the  Billboard  200 albums chart. But Swift's grip on the top spot would at least appear to be slipping, with several high-profile albums on the immediate horizon. Though she's yet to hit the  Billboard  200's top 10 in her career,  Rosalía 's  LUX  is due to hit next week's charts, and has gotten tremendous reviews. (Seriously, it's so great.)  Summer Walker 's  Finally Over It  drops this Friday and will enter the  Billboard  200 the following week.  Michael Bublé 's  Christmas  has —  [emits deep, tortured sigh, followed by a three-minute stare, unblinking, into the middle distance]  — already reentered the chart at No. 65. The Life of a Showgirl  easily survived this week's top new threat, as  Florence + The Machine  debuted at No. 4 with a Halloween-friendly new album called  Everybody Scream . And a huge chart leap for  Tyler, The Creator 's  CHROMAKOPIA  — boosted by the release of deluxe editions surrounding the anniversary of its release — only sent it from No. 117 to No. 5. Still, for  The Life of a Showgirl  — and for those of us who toil aggressively to avoid exposure to Bublé's music — winter is coming. Case in point: There are now  four  Christmas albums on the  Billboard  200. Bublé leads the way, followed by the  Vince Guaraldi Trio 's  A Charlie Brown Christmas  (No. 85), Carey's  Merry Christmas  (No. 113) and  Bing Crosby 's  Ultimate Christmas  (No. 160). Whole lotta holiday-music enthusiasts are out there opening their gifts early this year. TOP SONGS Taylor Swift is a master of extending her chart runs, thanks to a deep bag of tricks that includes remixes, staggered releases on vinyl and CD, acoustic versions and more. The woman possesses a great many talents, but she's an all-timer when it comes to leveraging her fans' enthusiasm. On the albums chart, it's a challenge to extend  The Life of a Showgirl 's run at No. 1, in part because she's already exhausted so many of those opportunities in the album's first week of release. The price of that record-setting sales week is that it gets harder and harder to go back to the well and sell fans more copies of the same album. But when it comes to \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" which tops the Hot 100 for a fifth straight week, she's still got some bullets in the chamber as she labors to remain ahead of two colossal hits. And she needs them, because the song isn't No. 1 in streaming  or  radio airplay this week. The top song on streaming is HUNTR/X's \"Golden,\" from the  KPop Demon Hunters  soundtrack. When it comes to commercial radio airplay, the top song is  Alex Warren 's \"Ordinary,\" which is likely evident to anyone who's tried to listen to a commercial pop station since, say, June. But the former lags a bit in airplay, the latter lags a bit in streaming and \"The Fate of Ophelia\" leads the field in sales — an area where Swift's bag of tricks comes in especially handy. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" gets a boost this week from two alternate versions: an \"Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version\" that's padding her streaming and sales numbers, and a brand-new remix by the duo Loud Luxury that dropped on Nov. 6. Those moves were enough to keep the song atop the Hot 100 for another week, but as the holidays loom, all three songs face a force as predictable as the tides. Today, they're jockeying for the top of the charts; tomorrow, they'll all be eating  Paul Anka 's dust. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/jefferey-epstein-donald-trump-documents-493aa8b123bbf52970586cf9ce19f498","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:38:58+00:00","title":"House Committee Releases Epstein Emails Linking Him to Trump, Prince Andrew, and Giuffre","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A House Oversight Committee released thousands of emails and documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, including messages he sent to political figures like Donald Trump, journalists such as Michael Wolff, and associates like Ghislaine Maxwell.

2025-11-13T02:38:58+00:00\n\nA House committee released thousands of documents related to Jefferey Epstein on Wednesday, many of them emails the convicted sex offender sent to his rich or influential friends, or to reporters, over many years. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee initially released three emails where Epstein mentioned President Donald Trump. Republicans on the committee responded by disclosing the bigger trove of documents and accused the Democrats of cherry-picking a few messages out of context in an effort to make Trump look bad. Epstein served about a year in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from someone under age 18 but then went on to renew relationships with many influential figures in business, academics and politics. Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. Here’s some takeaways from the documents released Wednesday. Epstein said Trump ‘knew about the girls,’ but it’s unclear what he meant Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year , had said that Epstein’s longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago. Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn’t asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn’t been a member. “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added. In July, Trump said he had banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago because his one-time friend was “taking people who worked for me,” including Giuffre. Before her death, Giuffre said that she only met Trump once and that he was not among the people who abused her. She didn’t think Trump knew of Epstein’s misconduct with underage girls. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Democrats had leaked select emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.” Mentions of former Prince Andrew In lawsuits and interviews, Giuffre accused Epstein and Maxwell of pressuring her into sexual encounters with Britain’s former Prince Andrew, starting when she was 17 years old. Those allegations eventually cost Andrew — now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — his official titles and his royal residence near Windsor Castle. In 2011, Epstein emailed a reporter and attacked Giuffre’s credibility. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,” wrote Epstein, before arguing that “this girl is a total liar.” Epstein wrote that he’d ask if then-Prince Andrew’s “people” would cooperate with the reporter for a story. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre’s allegations. That same year, Epstein, whose writing paid little heed to grammar or spelling, also mentioned Giuffre and Trump in an email that Epstein sent to Maxwell. “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. virignia spent hours at my house with him,, he has never once been mentioned,” Epstein wrote. “I have been thinking about that,” Maxwell responded. In other emails, Epstein strategized how to respond to Giuffre’s stories, which included an account of meeting former President Bill Clinton on Epstein’s island in the Caribbean. “Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ).” Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein’s private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of the women who say Epstein abused them, including Giuffre. Relationship with the press Many of the documents were email exchanges between Epstein and journalists he had longstanding relationships with, or who solicited his insights on financial markets and Trump. He was asked, typically off the record, to weigh in on everything from the president’s relationships with foreign leaders to the impact of oil prices on wealthy families in Saudi Arabia. Epstein offered to broker introductions between journalists and powerful people numerous times. He also contested the accusations against him. In a 2016 email to a reporter, Epstein denied ever spending time with former President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore on his island. “You can also add, fresh politcal juice by stating that Clinton was never on the island,” Epstein wrote. “I never met Al Gore. No diners on the island either, no matter how much detail has been in the press.” ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C. and Michael R.

formula at the heart of a nationwide recall . Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children’s hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer. Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease. The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm. Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured. “I wouldn’t guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,” said Stephen Dexter, 44. “She’s so little and you’re just helplessly watching this,” said Hanna Everett, 28. “It was awful.” This photo provided by Hanna Everett shows 4-month-old Piper Everett being treated for infantile botulism on Nov. 10, 2025, in a Kentucky hospital.

No deaths have been reported. Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness. Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said. The company sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said.

The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter. “This company potentially faces an existential crisis,” he said. ByHeart officials didn’t respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would “address any legal claims in due course.” “We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,” the company said in a statement.

Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a “natural option.” “I’m a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,” he said. “We do our best to buy something that says it’s organic.” But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn’t thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn’t wake her. Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children’s Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks. Hanna Everett said she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old. “It’s supposed to be similar to breast milk,” she said. Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots. “I was like, ’Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,” Everett recalled. At Kentucky Children’s Hospital, Piper’s condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy. Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Everett said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted. In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week. They appear to be doing well on different formulas, the families said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1411-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a wide range of global events: refugee movements in West Africa due to armed conflict, media legal disputes involving former US President Donald Trump and the BBC, a significant sports victory by Ireland’s football team through Troy Parrott’s performance, escalating violence in the West Bank involving Israeli settlers and the burning of a mosque, US government designations of terrorist groups from Germany, Greece, and Italy, labor strikes over wages and benefits, and a rise in cholera cases across Africa reported by the Africa CDC.

treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases — by reprogramming patients’ out-of-whack immune systems. When your body’s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today’s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don’t fix what’s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects — and too often the drugs aren’t enough to keep their disease in check. “We’re entering a new era,” said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who’s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer “the chance to control disease in a way we’ve never seen before.” How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.

Here’s what to know PHOTO ESSAY: One woman’s journey with lupus, the disease of 1,000 faces They’re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who’ve exhausted today’s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope. “What the heck is wrong with my body?” Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain. Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn’t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital’s study using a treatment adapted from cancer. Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, “I’m going to trust you.” Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength. “I can actually run, I can chase my kid,” said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. “I had forgotten what it was to be me.” ‘Living drugs’ reset rogue immune systems Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University, sits for a portrait in the lab where he’s studying some possible new treatments for autoimmune diseases, May 13, 2025, in Baltimore, Md.

But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas — immune cells called B cells — go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases. Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she’s been in remission — with no other medicine — since March 2021. Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma — and few relapses so far. Those early results were “shocking,” Hopkins’ Konig recalled. (AP Animation/Hao Li) They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases. How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient’s blood and sent to a lab, where they’re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those “living drugs” are infused back into the patient. While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can’t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they’re healthy. Other ways to reprogram rogue cells Researcher Abigail McGahan and others work at a lab at Johns Hopkins looking for potential treatments for autoimmune diseases. (AP Video/Shelby Lum) CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors. Another approach uses “peacekeeper” cells at the center of this year’s Nobel Prize . Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions. Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don’t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body’s existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen’s Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T. Last month, Grieshaber-Bouyer reported giving a course of one such drug, teclistamab, to 10 patients with a variety of diseases including Sjögren’s, myositis and systemic sclerosis. All but one improved significantly and six went into drug-free remission.

Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark “bad” B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.

It’s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells — and they’re outnumbered. Green’s team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune “generals” to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they’d “divide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,” Green said. The researchers will know it’s working if that galaxy-like map shows less red and more yellow. Studies in people are still a few years away.

Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production. Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease. About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful. Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he’s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people. PHOTO ESSAY: Meet more disease detectives 13 Photos On all these fronts, there’s a tremendous amount of research left to do — and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T’s safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing. Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma — and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus. “I just remember I woke up one day and thought, ‘Oh my god, I don’t feel sick anymore,’” she said. That kind of result has researchers optimistic. “We’ve never been closer to getting to — and we don’t like to say it — a potential cure,” said Hopkins’ Konig. “I think the next 10 years will dramatically change our field forever.” Dotted Line with Center Square The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

share intelligence with international agencies combatting drug trafficking, just days after President Gustavo Petro said he was suspending such collaboration with the United States over  attacks on vessels  in international waters.\n\nColombian Defence Minister Pedro Arnulfo Sanchez said in a social media post on Thursday that Petro had provided “clear instructions” to maintain a “continuous flow of information” with international agencies working on drug trafficking.\n\n“Against transnational crime, the answer is international cooperation,” Sanchez  wrote  on X.\n\nThe country’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti, also said in a separate statement that there had been “a misunderstanding” and Petro never said that US security agencies would stop working in Colombia alongside their Colombian counterparts.\n\n“We will continue working as this Government has done against drug trafficking and crime with the United States,”  Benedetti said  on social media.\n\nThe apparent about-face comes after Petro — a left-wing leader and vocal critic of US President Donald Trump —  said on Tuesday  that an order had been issued “to suspend communications and other dealings with US security agencies”.\n\nPetro has been critical of a series of deadly US attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration accused of smuggling illegal drugs.\n\nThe strikes have prompted widespread condemnation, with  United Nations officials  and other experts saying they amount to clear violations of international law.\n\n“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, said in late October.\n\n“The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”\n\nThe Trump administration has  rejected the criticism , saying its attacks in the Caribbean and the Pacific aim to deter drug traffickers. The US bombing campaign, which began in September, has killed at least 76 people to date.\n\nTrump, without providing any evidence, also has accused Petro of being involved in drug trafficking,  imposing sanctions  on the Colombian president and his family last month.\n\nThe Colombian leader has, in turn, called for Trump to be investigated for war crimes linked to the attacks, which have affected citizens from Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nPetro also has accused Washington of going after  peasants growing coca , the base ingredient of cocaine, instead of targeting major drug traffickers and money launderers.\n\nOn Sunday, Petro said that he met with the family of a Colombian fisherman who was allegedly killed in one of the US strikes.\n\n“He may have been carrying fish, or he may have been carrying cocaine, but he had not been sentenced to death,” Petro said during a summit between Latin American and European leaders hosted by Colombia. “There was no need to murder him.”\n\nUS news outlet CNN reported earlier this week that the United Kingdom had suspended some intelligence-sharing with the US over its strikes on the boats in the Caribbean.\n\nBut US Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected that report. Without going into any details or explaining what about CNN’s reporting was inaccurate, Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that the story was “fake”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that patients with cancer who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines before starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors.

rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Super Typhoon Uwan in the Philippines, devastated northern provinces including Catanduanes, Eastern Samar, Nueva Vizcaya, Mountain Province, and Ifugao, killing at least 10 people and displacing over 1.4 million.

Trump has designated four European groups as “specially designated global terrorists” for their links to the loose-knit, left-wing movement known as “antifa”.\n\nThursday’s  announcement  was yet another step in Trump’s campaign to dismantle antifa, short for “anti-fascist”.\n\nThe four sanctioned groups include Antifa Ost in Germany; the Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI) in Italy; Armed Proletarian Justice in Greece; and Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, also in Greece.\n\nAs part of Thursday’s statement, the US Department of State declared additional plans to list the four groups as “foreign terrorist organisations”, effective November 20.\n\nIt accused the four groups of a number of violent acts across Europe in their fights against capitalism, right-wing governments, and the oppression of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe US State Department warned that the designations came with consequences for any US-based person or entity that did business with the four groups.\n\n“Persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with those designated today may expose themselves to sanctions risk,” the State Department said in its statement. ”Notably, engaging in certain transactions with them entails risk of secondary sanctions pursuant to counterterrorism authorities.”\n\nCritics have accused the Trump administration of expanding the definition of “terrorism” far beyond its traditional meaning.\n\nWhile “terrorism” is often used to describe domestic and international threats that use violence to achieve political aims, Trump has applied the label to drug cartels, Latin American gangs and antifa.\n\nExperts, however, point out that antifa is a broad political and protest movement with no unified leader. It is generally seen as a collection of principles rather than an organised movement, and many antifa protests are peaceful.\n\nStill, on September 22, Trump issued an executive order saying he  would designate  the left-wing group as a “domestic terrorist organisation”.\n\n“Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law,” Trump  said  in the order.\n\n“It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.”\n\nThat designation could potentially render antifa-related activity illegal. Providing “material support” for designated “terrorist” groups is a crime under federal law.\n\nHowever, since antifa is not a cohesive group, there is no way of identifying the financiers of the movement, as it comprises several autonomous groups with varied funding sources, which are often not made public.\n\nExperts have also raised concerns about the First Amendment right to free speech and association under the US Constitution, arguing that Trump’s designations could dampen left-wing activism.\n\n“Speaking of ‘antifa’ in the singular is misleading and plays into Trump’s efforts to repress the left,” historian Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, told Al Jazeera in September.\n\nBray cast doubt on Trump’s assertions that antifa is a “coordinated” organisation that “conceal[s] its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement”.\n\n“He is trying to promote the common right-wing conspiracy theory that there are shadowy financiers like George Soros playing puppet master behind everything the left does,” Bray explained.\n\n“The reality is that antifa groups do not have large budgets at all, and what they have is basically crowdsourced or generated from members themselves. It’s mostly for bail, really.”\n\nExperts like Bray agree  that antifa is an ideology rather than an organised group.\n\n“Antifa is  a kind of politics , not a specific group,” Bray told Al Jazeera, “in the same way that there are feminist groups but feminism is not, itself, a group.”\n\nThe historian warned that Trump’s efforts to label antifa a “terrorist organisation” could be used “as a blanket excuse for the regime to crack down on anyone to the left of them”, articulating fears of political repression under the right-wing president."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/james-comey-letitia-james-argue-us-attorney-in-their-cases-hired-illegally","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:09:57Z","title":"James Comey, Letitia James argue US attorney in their cases hired illegally","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Comey and Letitia James, both prominent critics of President Donald Trump, have petitioned a federal judge to dismiss criminal cases against them, claiming the indictments were the result of illegal and politically motivated actions.

The Justice Department counters that the appointments are lawful and the charges valid, calling the claims a 'paperwork error'. President Trump openly supported the indictments, criticizing the prior US Attorney and praising Halligan. The judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, has expressed skepticism, noting gaps in the grand jury transcript and questioning whether Attorney General Pam Bondi could have reviewed the proceedings. A watchdog group, Campaign for Accountability, has also accused Halligan of violating professional ethics by conducting indictments without career prosecutors and with minimal jury support, suggesting a politically driven outcome.","keyTakeAways":["Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer formerly part of Trump’s personal legal team, was appointed as interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of

Letitia James argue US attorney in their cases hired illegally\n\nLawyers for James Comey and Letitia James have asked a federal judge to dismiss the criminal cases filed against them, claiming the administration of President Donald Trump illegally installed the prosecutor who brought the charges.\n\nOn Thursday, US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie heard their petition in Alexandria, Virginia, as the two defendants seek to have their cases tossed before they reach trial.\n\nBoth Comey and James are considered prominent critics of President Trump, and they have argued that the charges against them are a form of political retribution.\n\nThursday’s petition concerned the role of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan in the two indictments.\n\nHalligan, an insurance lawyer who was formerly part of Trump’s personal legal team, was appointed to the role of US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on an interim basis.\n\nUS attorneys are the top federal prosecutors in their districts, and to be appointed on a permanent basis, nominees must first be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHalligan, however, arrived at her role under unusual circumstances. Her predecessor, Erik Siebert, had been forced out in September amid pressure from President Trump.\n\nInterim US attorneys may only serve a period of 120 days, after which point federal judges decide who can stay in the role. Siebert had gotten that approval. Halligan had not. It was instead the Department of Justice that named Halligan to the position of interim US attorney.\n\nLawyers for Comey and James have therefore maintained that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid.\n\n“The only thing that matters is whether Ms Halligan had a proper appointment when she stood before the grand jury, and she did not,” Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey’s lawyers, said on Thursday.\n\nThe Justice Department, however, has argued that the law does not prevent the appointments of successive interim US attorneys, nor does any ambiguity on the matter render Halligan’s indictments invalid.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Henry Whitaker called the concerns, at best, a “paperwork error” — and not a reason to throw out the charges.\n\nHalligan’s appointment in September corresponded with a series of indictments against Trump rivals and critics, including James — a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) — and James, the attorney general of New York state.\n\nComey was  indicted on September 25  for allegedly making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The case against him focuses on whether he lied to senators during his  2020 testimony  about the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian election interference in 2016.\n\nComey has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has likewise denied any wrongdoing in her case. On October 9, she was indicted on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution, both of which carry a maximum of 30 years in prison.\n\nA third Trump critic, former national security adviser, John Bolton, was also indicted on October 16 on charges related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents. He, too, has pleaded  not guilty .\n\nBolton was not part of Thursday’s court hearing.\n\nLawyers for Bolton, Comey and James have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president’s personal vendettas towards their clients.\n\nTrump had openly called for the Comey and James indictments in September, addressing a Truth Social post to Attorney General Pam Bondi that blasted the Justice Department for “all talk, no action”.\n\n“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” he  wrote  on September 20.\n\nHe also denounced Siebert for failing to bring cases against James and Comey, while praising Halligan.\n\n“There is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,” Trump wrote. “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.”\n\nAt Thursday’s hearing, Currie did not immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving.\n\nCurrie did, however, express scepticism about the Justice Department’s case.\n\nShe told the court that she had not been provided with a full transcript of the grand jury proceeding that led to Comey’s indictment.\n\nThe judge also noted that for part of the day of the Comey indictment — from 4:28pm local time until the moment when the indictment was returned — there was “no court reporter present” to take notes on the proceedings.\n\nThat leaves a gap in the documentation of the grand jury’s activities, Currie explained.\n\nShe indicated that it also creates a dilemma with one of the Justice Department’s arguments: that Attorney General Bondi had ratified the Comey indictment, along with Halligan.\n\n“It’s become obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the missing portion of the transcript, Currie said.\n\nIn a separate complaint ( PDF ) earlier this week, the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability also asked state bar authorities in Florida and Virginia to investigate Halligan over alleged violations of professional conduct.\n\n“Ms. Halligan’s actions appear to constitute an abuse of power and serve to undermine the integrity of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erode public confidence in the legal profession and the fair administration of justice,” the group stated in its complaint.\n\nCampaign for Accountability pointed out that, while Siebert refused to indict Comey and James, Halligan proceeded to do so despite scant evidence.\n\nIt also pointed out irregularities in how she procured the indictments from the grand juries involved.\n\n“In violation of customary practice, no career prosecutors from the US Attorney’s Office participated, and only 14 of the 23 grand jurors who heard the presentation voted to indict Mr. Comey,” the complaint reads.\n\nIt accuses Halligan of appearing to have “made false statements of material fact to both the grand jury and the district court” in both Comey’s and James’s cases.\n\n“The evidence appears to demonstrate that, absent President Trump’s intervention, neither Mr Comey nor Ms James would have been indicted,” it alleges."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/medical-experts-say-africa-faces-worst-cholera-outbreak-in-25-years","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:37:40+00:00","title":"Medical experts say Africa faces worst cholera outbreak in 25 years","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Africa is experiencing its worst cholera outbreak in 25 years, with over 300,000 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 7,000 deaths in 2025.

Burundi seeing renewed surges that suggest active transmission of the disease, according to African medical officials.\n\nOn Thursday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a public health agency for the African Union, said it had recorded about 300,000 confirmed and suspected cases of cholera so far in 2025. In addition, it had logged more than 7,000 deaths.\n\nThe figures show an increase of more than 30 percent over the total number of cases recorded last year, which was 254,075.\n\n“Cholera is still a major issue,” Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya said in a news briefing on Thursday. “It’s like every year we have more and more cases.”\n\nKaseya told reporters that two countries in particular have shown increases, suggesting active transmission of the infection: Angola and Burundi.\n\nAngola has seen at least 33,563 total cases of cholera so far in 2025, resulting in 866 deaths, and Burundi has experienced at least 2,380 cases, leading to 10 deaths.\n\nCholera is a bacterial disease usually spread when people drink contaminated water or have contact with the water through open wounds. In some cases, it is possible to become infected when eating raw shellfish.\n\nIt cannot be transmitted from person to person, so casual contact with a person who has the disease is not a risk.\n\nThe disease causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration. If the disease is left untreated, cholera can kill within hours — even among people who were previously healthy.\n\nThe Africa CDC blamed the rise of the disease on poor access to safe water and conflicts across the continent.\n\n“As we know, without water, we cannot really control the outbreak,” Kaseya said Thursday.\n\nEven in countries that have seen slight declines in cholera cases, Kaseya encouraged health officials to address the root causes, including overcrowding and poor sanitation in refugee camps.\n\n“Insecurity, displacement of our populations — all of that are not helping, in addition to a lack of wash commodities,” he said.\n\nAs of August , at least 40 people had died from cholera in Sudan’s Darfur region, with local refugee camps hit particularly hard.\n\nThe medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, described the situation as the country’s  worst outbreak in years .\n\nThe war in Sudan has damaged and destroyed much of the country’s civilian infrastructure, including sewage and water treatment works, and turned many places, including the capital Khartoum, into battlefields.\n\n“On top of an all-out war, people in Sudan are now experiencing the worst cholera outbreak the country has seen in years,” MSF said in a statement in August, cited by the AFP news agency.\n\n“In the Darfur region alone, MSF teams treated over 2,300 patients and recorded 40 deaths in the past week.”\n\nIn total, Sudan has experienced at least 71,728 cases of cholera in 2025, resulting in 2,012 deaths, according to the Africa CDC.\n\nCholera is not new to Sudan. In 2017, a previous outbreak killed at least 700 people and infected about 22,000 in less than two months. In this most recent outbreak,  officials speculate  that water supplies became contaminated with cholera due to the floodwaters mixing with sewage."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/trump-administration-joins-lawsuit-against-californias-redistricting-maps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"23:47:37+00:00","title":"Trump administration joins lawsuit against California’s redistricting maps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has joined a legal challenge against California’s new congressional redistricting map, which was approved via Proposition 50—a ballot initiative with 64% support.

joins lawsuit against California’s redistricting maps\n\nThe administration of United States President Donald Trump has joined a lawsuit against California over the state’s redistricting effort, which was approved by a landslide in the November 4 election.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Justice said it would seek to overturn California’s new map of congressional districts, which was passed through a ballot initiative with approximately 64 percent support.\n\n“California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\nShe accused California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, of attempting to stifle Republican voices in his state. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.”\n\nThe  ballot measure , known as Proposition 50, is poised to redraw the boundaries of electoral districts to favour the Democrats in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposition was designed as a counterattack against  Trump ’s gerrymandering in Republican states.\n\nIn Texas, for instance, the Trump White House urged the state legislature to pass new congressional districts that would allow the Republicans the opportunity to win five more seats in the House of Representatives in 2026.\n\nIn August, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the new Republican-backed map into law.\n\nRepublicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio. Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nProposition 50  in California means that Democrats might win as many as five additional seats in the House in 2026, in an explicit attempt to offset the new Texas congressional map.\n\nHowever, the California Republican Party and 19 registered voters sued the state in federal court on November 5, a day after the election was held.\n\nThey claimed California’s redistricting effort violates provisions of the US Constitution by unlawfully favouring Hispanic communities.\n\nThe Justice Department has echoed those concerns in its complaint. It argues that California’s map “manipulates district lines in the name of bolstering the voting power of Hispanic Californians because of their race”.\n\nTonight, California sent a powerful message to Donald Trump.

top epidemiologist warning that nearly one-third of the population has been impacted, with large numbers of workers taken ill.\n\nOn Thursday, fumigators armed with fogging machines probed alleys and crowded buildings in parts of the capital Havana, among the hardest hit by mosquito-borne viruses including dengue and chikungunya, authorities said.\n\nIt comes after Francisco Duran, the national director of epidemiology at the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, described the situation in the Caribbean island nation as “acute”.\n\n“We are working intensely, as we did with COVID-19,” Duran said, referring to ongoing research projects to find medications and vaccines to help tame the virus’s impacts.\n\nDengue fever has long plagued Cuba, but has grown worse as the government’s ability to fumigate, clean roadside rubbish and patch leaky pipes has been hampered by an ongoing economic crisis.\n\nThe once-rare chikungunya virus – which causes severe headache, rashes and joint pain which can linger months after infection, causing long-term disability – has also spread quickly in recent months.\n\nChikungunya, which is spread primarily by the Aedes mosquito species that also carries dengue and Zika, has no specific treatment.\n\nDuran said Cuban health authorities are conducting two clinical trials to test the efficacy of Jusviza, an injectable drug used to control hyperinflammation, in treating chikungunya.\n\nHe continued that another trial is under way to evaluate rectal ozone therapy as a treatment for patients with joint pain following chikungunya’s acute phase. This form of treatment involves administering ozone gas through the rectum.\n\nOutbreaks of chikungunya  have infected almost 340,000 people globally so far in 2025, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), resulting in 145 deaths in at least 16 countries. In July, the World Health Organization issued an urgent call for action to prevent another epidemic of the virus.\n\nCuba’s healthcare system, once among the best in Latin America, has suffered under a  decades-long economic embargo  orchestrated by the United States, seeking to pressure Havana’s nominally communist government into making political and economic reforms.\n\nCitizens in the impoverished island nation routinely suffer from severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine, while the poorest are often unable to purchase insect repellent.\n\nThe issue is exacerbated by frequent power outages, which leave Cubans with little choice but to open their windows and doors to ease the heat, inviting mosquitoes in and facilitating the spread of the disease.\n\n“The blockade is a policy of collective punishment,” Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in late October, as the United Nations General Assembly again overwhelmingly called for an end to Washington’s embargo for a 33rd year.\n\n“It flagrantly, massively and systematically violates the human rights of Cubans. It makes no distinction between social sectors or economic actors,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/ivory-coast-boosts-border-defence-due-to-unusual-flow-of-malian-refugees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:17:10Z","title":"Ivory Coast boosts border defence due to ‘unusual flow’ of Malian refugees","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ivory Coast has heightened its border security in response to an unusual flow of refugees from Mali, driven by sustained militant attacks and a fuel blockade imposed by the al-Qaeda-linked group Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM).

said.\n\nIvory Coast’s National Security Council (NSC) said in a statement on Thursday that the “influx appears to be due to attacks against civilians by armed terrorist groups in several areas of southern Mali”.\n\n“The National Security Council has instructed its Executive Secretary to take all necessary steps to register these asylum seekers,” the statement said.\n\n“Furthermore, the Chief

cash.\n\nThe group has killed thousands of people since 2017, though the overall death toll is unclear.\n\nThe group also seeks regime change in Mali, and JNIM has warned foreigners against doing business with the ruling military government – in power since it overthrew the country’s democratically elected government in a  2020 coup d’etat  – without its “authorisation”.\n\nSeeking to pressure the military government to negotiate, in September, JNIM sealed off major highways used by tankers and targeted fuel trucks attempting to reach the landlocked Sahel country from Ivory Coast and Senegal.\n\nThe move has effectively created an  economic and fuel blockade  on the capital, Bamako, bringing the city to breaking point and causing desperation among residents, many of whom have fled to neighbouring Ivory Coast.\n\nOn Wednesday, JNIM militants attacked the town of Loulouni, about 50km (30 miles) from the Ivory Coast border, causing hundreds more people to flee.\n\nIvory Coast

Rights groups say Israel already maintains a system of de facto annexation and apartheid in the West Bank.\n\nThe UN human rights office warned in July that the settler violence was being carried out “with the acquiescence, support, and in some cases participation, of Israeli security forces”.\n\nSettler and military attacks , it said, “are part of a broader and coordinated strategy of the State of Israel to expand and consolidate annexation of the occupied West Bank, while reinforcing its system of discrimination, oppression and control over Palestinians there”.\n\nThursday’s attack on the mosque in Deir Istiya prompted an outpouring of international condemnation.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres said the international body was “deeply disturbed” by the assault. “Such attacks on places of worship are completely unacceptable,” Stephane Dujarric told reporters during a briefing at the UN headquarters in New York.\n\n“We have and will continue to condemn attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians and their property in the West Bank,” Dujarric said.\n\n“Israel, as the occupying power, has a responsibility to protect the civilian population and ensure that those responsible for these attacks, including this attack on a mosque and the spray-painting of horrendous language on the mosque, be brought to account.”\n\nJordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also “strongly condemned” the rise in Israeli settler attacks, according to a statement shared by the Palestinian news agency Wafa.\n\nA Jordan Foreign Ministry spokesman described the violence as “an extension of the Israeli government’s extremist policies and inflammatory rhetoric that fuel violence and extremism against the Palestinian people”.\n\nGermany, which has  faced criticism  for defending Israel amid the Gaza war, also  called  for a halt to settler violence, saying the “incidents must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible held accountable”.\n\nThe Swiss Foreign Ministry likewise said recent Israeli arson attacks in the West Bank “are unacceptable”. “This violence and the continued expansion of illegal settlements must stop,” it said in a statement.\n\nPalestinians have urged world leaders to go beyond words, however, and take concrete action against Israel amid the wave of violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including by ending weapons transfers to the Israeli military.\n\nIn a separate incident last week, Israeli settlers set fire to a Palestinian home in the village of Khirbet Abu Falah, near Ramallah, while a family was inside, the UN’s humanitarian office reported.\n\n“As the flames spread, the family immediately evacuated while neighbours and civil defence teams rushed to the scene and managed to extinguish the fire. The mother sustained a leg fracture while running away from the settlers,” OCHA said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/us-announces-southern-spear-mission-as-forces-deploy-to-south-america","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"03:16:17+00:00","title":"US announces ‘Southern Spear’ mission as forces deploy to South America","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has announced Operation Southern Spear, a military campaign led by U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to target so-called narco-terrorists and disrupt drug trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas.

conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978652","dateOfPublication":"2023-09-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00+00:00","title":"U.S. Announces New Immigration Policy to Improve Asylum Seeker Processing Times","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States Department of Homeland Security has announced a new policy aimed at improving the processing of immigration cases, particularly for asylum seekers.

Someone who – simply through good conversation – gets you to open up? Makes you feel smarter, more interesting or just understood?  These are all common traits of \"supercommunicators\" — people who are consistently able to create authentic connections with others just by listening and talking. They're the topic of a new book published this month,  Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection , by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg.  You don't need a specific personality type — like being outgoing or chatty — to be an effective conversationalist, says Duhigg in his book. \"It's just a set of skills that anyone can learn,\" like asking deep questions or being vulnerable.   \n       \n      Related Story:  Oops, I messed up! 7 common public speaking issues — and how to fix them \n       You'll want to master these skills, he says, because they can help you bond with others in \"a profound way that makes life so much more meaningful.\" In fact, studies have shown that when people have positive personal relationships and feel connected to their communities – a feat made possible through good communication – they tend to  have happier, healthier and longer lives .  Duhigg, who drew on scientific research, psychology and interviews with people whose jobs rely on communication (like executives and spies) to write his book, shares four habits of supercommunicators.  1. They know what kind of conversation they're having One key trait of supercommunicators is that they know what kind of conversation they're having — and are therefore able to respond accordingly, says Duhigg. Generally, conversations tend to fall into three categories.  Practical conversations:  Let's say you are talking to a friend who is complaining about work. If you were having a practical conversation, your friend might ask you to help problem-solve and make hard decisions. They may ask straightforward questions like, \"What do you think I should do about my boss?\" If you're in this type of conversation, be ready to give good advice.   Emotional conversations:  People engaging in these types of discussions are seeking empathy, not answers, says Duhigg. If your friend who is complaining about work is expressing their feelings and saying things like, \"I'm so frustrated this is happening!\" or \"my work environment is so stressful!\" you may want to show your support by being a good listener.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Good conversations take time and attention. Here's how to have better ones  \n       Social conversations:  Any time you're, say, gossiping about office politics, discussing relationships with friends or sharing how your family background influences your identity, you're having a social conversation. These discussions reflect \"how we see others and how other people see us,\" says Duhigg. If you're in this type of dialogue, be mindful of the different perspectives each person brings to the table and seek common ground.  2. They 'prove' they're listening There are plenty of ways to  appear  like you're listening, says Duhigg, like making eye contact or nodding intently. But  proving  to someone that you're listening is the quickest road to making someone feel heard. To do that, he suggests a technique called \"looping for understanding .\"  First, ask someone a question and then listen to their response. Next, repeat back in your own words what they just told you. Lastly – and this is the step that people usually forget, he says – ask your conversation partner if you got what they said correct.  This practice might sound fairly simple, but it packs a big punch, says Duhigg. \"When we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak,\" he says. So if you can show someone you genuinely want to understand them, it creates trust — even if you both completely disagree with each other.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How to have tricky conversations \n       3. They ask (a lot of) the right questions  Research shows that highly effective communicators tend to ask  10 to 20 times  as many questions as everyone else. They may simply be follow-up questions that signal to the other person that you're interested in the conversation, like \"So did you make it on time?\" or \"What happened next?\"  Supercommunicators also ask questions that get people to open up. Duhigg calls these \"deep questions.\" They \"ask about people's values, beliefs or experiences\" and \"spark an opportunity for emotional connection.\"  This might sound overly intimate, especially if you're talking to a stranger, but he says it doesn't have to be. Be intentional with your framing and take time to think of \"the real question instead of the rote question.\"  Let's say you've met an acquaintance at a party. Instead of just asking what they do for a living, ask, \"Do you love what you do?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Want to listen better? Turn down your thoughts and tune in to others \n       When in doubt, Duhigg says to just ask \"why.' Generally, people love to talk about how they see the world. \"What I've found is that within three questions you can get to something real if you ask 'why,' \" he says. \"And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from.\" 4. They aim to understand For a supercommunicator, the goal of a discussion isn't to impress someone, convince someone or wait for their turn to speak, says Duhigg. It's to genuinely comprehend someone else's point of view and share their own views  accordingly.  Let's say you mention to your co-worker that you're stressed about your childcare situation. Many people might breeze past an emotional comment, feign curiosity or offer empty platitudes. But a supercommunicator would sit with the emotion you offer them. They might ask you a deep question about your situation and then offer a story about some of their own struggles at home.  This kind of response, says Duhigg, creates an atmosphere of trust, vulnerability and openness that both parties can benefit from. It says, \"if you know I want to understand you, you're going to want to understand me.\"  \"And that is actually the most magical thing that can happen,\" he adds.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Hey there. Stacey Vanek Smith here in for Marielle Segarra. When you are having a bad day, who do you call? Who is that person who makes you feel better, maybe someone who really listens to you? I'm guessing there's a name or a face that's popped into your mind right now. CHARLES DUHIGG: Yeah. Me, too. I think everyone listening probably has someone. And for you, that person is a supercommunicator. And you're probably a supercommunicator back to them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANEK SMITH: Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the bestselling author of \"The Power Of Habit.\" His new book, \"Supercommunicators,\" is a guide to how to unlock the secret language of connection. The secret to real, authentic connection? I mean, it's not such a big secret. We have all had those amazing conversations at one time or another, felt that buzz when your ideas are really in sync with a colleague, or that amazing feeling when you have a conversation with your partner and you feel like they really get you. DUHIGG: But there are some people who can do this more consistently with basically anyone. And what we've learned is that it's not an inborn trait. It's not that introverts can do it better than extroverts or vice versa. Rather, there are some people who have just paid a little bit more attention to how they communicate with other people and how others communicate with them. VANEK SMITH: And those people, those supercommunicators, they're the people for whom doors of opportunity often open up a lot more readily, people who build and maintain genuine connections, says Charles. They live longer, happier, fuller lives. And all it takes to start is some authentic conversation. DUHIGG: Listening to their own instincts and saying, the goal of this discussion ought to be not to impress you, not to make you think I'm smart, not to convince you that I'm right. The goal of this conversation should be to understand you. And if you know that I want to understand you, you're going to want to understand me. And that is actually the most magical thing that can happen. VANEK SMITH: In this episode of LIFE KIT, we take a look at how to be a supercommunicator. Reporter Andee Tagle talks to Charles Duhigg about connection, conversation, and the power of asking good questions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE: Charles, let's talk a little bit about the power of connection. I think everyone would agree that it's nice to have a nice conversation, but that's different than real, meaningful connection, right? I'm really fascinated by the physiological effects that connecting can have on people. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? DUHIGG: Yeah, absolutely. So when we really connect with someone in conversation, when we are sort of on what you might refer to as the same wavelength, what's interesting is it's reflected in our bodies and our brains. So right now, we're having a conversation even though we're separated by hundreds of miles. And yet if we could measure this, what we would see is that your eye pupils and my eye pupils are starting to dilate at the same rate. Our breath patterns are starting to match each other. Our heart rates are starting to match each other. And even more importantly, if we could see inside our brains, what we would see is that my brainwaves are starting to look like your brainwaves and vice versa. Within psychology and neurology, this is known as neural entrainment, and it's at the core of how we communicate with each other. And what it tells us is that communication is connection. When you and I are really communicating with each other, our bodies and our brains become connected in a way that allows us to understand and hear each other much more clearly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: So, Takeaway 1, communication is connection. We tend to think that the goal of a conversation is to make a point or say your opinion. But Charles says that's not a good way to judge the success of an interaction. Instead, in order to really connect, aim to have what he calls a learning conversation. DUHIGG: A conversation is successful if I understand you and you understand me. And what's really nice about that is that if you go in with this attitude of wanting to have a learning conversation, where my goal is simply to learn how you see the world and to share with you how I see the world so you can learn my perspectives, then it takes away all this pressure. I don't have to convince you to vote for my guy. I don't have to convince you to support my issue. I don't have to convince you to support my team. Instead, what I want to do is I want to understand how you see the world. And there's tactics that help us do that. One of my favorite ways of doing this, particularly if you're having a conversation amid conflict is something known as looping for understanding. And what it is - it has three steps. You should ask someone a question, and some questions are more powerful than others. You should listen to what they say. And then step No. 2, you should repeat back in your own words what they just told you. And then step No. 3, and this is the one we usually forget, is you should ask them if you got it right. The reason this is so powerful is because particularly when we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak. But if it's a learning conversation, a conversation where I really want to understand you, if I start proving to you that I'm listening, proving that I want to understand, and then asking you to make sure that I'm getting this right, that I genuinely do understand, both of us are going to trust each other more, even if we completely disagree with each other. TAGLE: So, let me make sure that I have that right. That was looping for understanding, where we're actively showing people that we're listening to them by, you know, paying attention, by asking follow-up questions and making sure that we have that information correct. Is that correct? DUHIGG: That's exactly - so, yes... TAGLE: How'd we do? DUHIGG: So ask a question. You did a good job. You did a good job. Ask a question and then repeat back what you heard them say in your own words, as you just did, and then ask if you got it right. So you are a super communicator. You do this really well. TAGLE: We're doing OK. Thanks so much, Charles. We're hanging in there. We're hanging in there. That's wonderful. DUHIGG: (Laughter). TAGLE: Let's move on to the matching principle, which I know is a big part of super communicating. Matching isn't as simple as mimicking someone's body language, right? DUHIGG: Yeah, absolutely. So one of the best examples is how I came to this book, because I felt like I was having some communication problems in my life. And one in particular, a pattern that I found was happening again and again is, I would come home after a tough day at work and I would start complaining to my wife and I would say, you know, my boss is a jerk and my coworkers don't appreciate me. And she very reasonably would say, oh, you know, why don't you take your boss out for lunch and get to know each other a little bit better? She would try and solve my problem. And instead of listening to her, what I would do is I would get even more upset. I would say, you know, no, I want you to be outraged on my behalf. I want you to be - to support me. And she would get upset because I was acting irrational. She was giving me good advice. And so when I went to researchers and I asked them about this, what they said is like, well, here's the problem. People tend to think of a discussion as being about one thing. It's about my day, or it's about Jimmy's grades or where to go on vacation. But actually every discussion is made up of multiple different kinds of conversations. And in particular, those conversations tend to fall into one of three buckets. There's practical conversations, where we're solving problems or we're making plans. There's emotional discussions where I might share how I'm feeling, and I don't want you to solve my problem. I want you to listen and empathize. And then there's social conversations where we're talking about how we see each other in the context of society. And other people see us. And they said, look, when you were coming home, you were having an emotional conversation. You wanted to talk about how you feel. And your wife responded with a practical conversation. And both of those conversations are totally valid. But because you were having different conversations at the same moment, you couldn't really hear each other. And so the answer is, what you mentioned, the matching principle - that once we figure out what kind of conversation is occurring, that if I match you or I invite you to match me, that's where we really are able to hear each other. TAGLE: Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone. Is it a practical, emotional, social? Once you understand their goals, it'll be easier to really connect. Here's how to decipher one from the other. You say in the book that we all send clues as we speak to other people about what conversation we want to have, right? DUHIGG: Yeah. TAGLE: Can you give us some tools to be better conversation sleuths? You know... DUHIGG: Yes. TAGLE: ...What should we look out for in ourselves and in other people to determine where a conversation is headed? DUHIGG: There's one tactic in particular that's really helpful in figuring out what kind of a conversation is happening. What does this other person want and need, and what do I want out of this discussion? There's certain kinds of questions that are special. These are known as deep questions. To figure out what everyone wants from a conversation, you should ask deep questions. And a deep question is something that asks about people's values or beliefs or experiences. And that can sound kind of scary, right? That sounds pretty intimate, but it's actually pretty... TAGLE: Yeah. DUHIGG: ...Easy to do. If you meet someone who's new, and you ask them, what do you do for a living? And they say, I'm a lawyer, you can ask, oh, you know, what made you decide to become a lawyer? Like, did you always want to be a lawyer? Do you love your job? Those three questions - they're asking that person to talk about their values and their beliefs, the experiences that led them to law school, whether they enjoy going to work each day, what they enjoy about it. They're easy questions to ask. But when we respond to them, we describe so much about ourselves. And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from. The difference between someone who says, oh, I decided to become a lawyer because, you know, I grew up a little bit poor, and I always wanted to have a steady job. I wanted to be able to provide for my family. That person is in a practical frame of mind. They're having a practical conversation. But someone else who says, I decided to become a lawyer because I saw my dad get arrested, and I wanted to fight for the underdog. That person is in a more emotional or maybe even social state of mind. We should have a different kind of conversation with them. It's easy to ask deep questions, easier than we think it is. But more importantly, we learn what this other person is seeking out of this conversation, and we get to share with them what we want as well. TAGLE: It sounds like what you're talking about is the idea of emotional reciprocity, right? DUHIGG: Yes, absolutely. So if someone says, you know - if someone shares something with us that's a little bit vulnerable, we should acknowledge that we've heard that. If they say - if we ask, how was this weekend? And they say, oh, it was a little bit of a tough weekend. And we ask, why? What happened? You know, what was going on? And they say, well, I had to go to a funeral. At that moment, what we should do is rather than skip... TAGLE: Avoid it at all costs, right? DUHIGG: ...Yeah, is lean in a little bit and say, oh, I'm so sorry. Like, tell me about the person. What did they mean to you? And then we can share about ourselves and we can say, you know, my father - and this is actually true - my father passed away six years ago. And one of the things that's been really fascinating to me is how much my relationship with him has continued after his death. Now we're, you know, 45 seconds, a minute into a conversation and we're talking about something real, something where we can get to know each other and understand each other a little bit better. And that emotional reciprocity is at the core of how we learn to trust and like each other. (SOUINDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway three - ask deep questions. That means going beyond your go-to small talk, but you don't have to do that on the fly. Charles recommends preparing for conversations. DUHIGG: There was a study that was done at Harvard Business School, where they asked students before they had a conversation with a stranger. They asked all the students to write down three topics that they thought they could discuss. This took like 10 seconds, right? People would write down, like, you know, this weekend's game and what TV shows I watch, just little dumb throwaway things. And then they went and they had conversations with strangers, and everyone would put the card away. Many of them would put it in their back pocket. And the topics they had jotted down often never came up. But the fact that they were there almost overwhelmingly made all of the participants feel less anxious about those discussions. And as a result, those discussions went much, much better. Oftentimes when we're thinking about talking to someone, when we're thinking about a conversation, particularly a hard conversation - right? - a serious one, we can get really anxious about it because we don't know how it's going to go. And if we just sit down and we just think a little bit, you know, I'm calling up my friend Greg, and I really want to find out, like, if he has any plans for this summer, and I hope that it's just an easy, light conversation. That takes four seconds for me to decide before I start dialing. But studies show it'll make the conversation go better. Because I'm prepared. I'm prepared for what arises. But I also know what I want, and I'm prepared to listen to what he wants. TAGLE: Such a simple thing - you know, if you're nervous, just having a couple topics in your back pocket can make it easier, can make you feel more at ease. DUHIGG: It makes all the difference in the world. I've been thinking about this a lot with conversations with my kids. So I have a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old. They come home from school and, like, I go into auto mode sometimes where I'm like, hey, how was school today? It was fine. Do you have any homework? Yes. I - without even thinking about it, I start asking all these un-deep questions. And so now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to - before my kids get home, I try and think up, like, what's the question that I can ask my son that he actually wants to answer? And sometimes that question is things like, you know, who do you think is the best basketball player of all time? Which is apropos of nothing, but he loves to answer. TAGLE: (Laughter). DUHIGG: And sometimes it's like, hey, you know, I - you mentioned that you went skateboarding with your friends after school. And I'm just wondering, like, Jasper - he seems like a really good friend of yours. Like, what is it about Jasper you like so much? Like, what do you admire about Jasper? When I think and try and come up with these slightly deeper questions, it's as if I've unlocked something in my kids, and suddenly they start telling me about why they like some of their friends and drama with other friends. And then we have real conversations, and then I can tell them about when I was a kid, which they're hopefully fascinated by and sometimes bored by. But it just takes, like, 10 seconds to come up with the real question as opposed to the, the rote question, which is how is school? Do you have homework? So I try and do that more. TAGLE: Just to take a little bit of time - I love that. What about for people who don't - for which that creative question isn't readily available? You know, like, for a stranger, for someone you don't totally know - I mean, you can do a little bit of your research, but if you're not quite sure what's going to open them up, what... DUHIGG: Yeah. TAGLE: ...Any advice there? DUHIGG: So there's a guy named Nicholas Epley, who's a professor at the University of Chicago who's studied this exact question his whole career. And what he's found is that almost any question that asks why helps people open up. So as I mentioned, you know, what do you do for a living? I'm a lawyer. Oh, yeah? Why did you decide to become a lawyer? You know, what did you have for lunch today? I had grilled cheese. Oh, yeah? Why did you decide to have grilled cheese? When we ask why, what we're doing is we're inviting the other person to explain who they are. And it can - when I'm describing it this way, it can seem like, oh, maybe that's harder than it is. Maybe that's more awkward than it is. But what Nick has found is that within three questions - between strangers, between close friends, between people who have nothing in common - within three questions, you can get to something real if you ask why. And it's always easy to ask why. People love to be asked why. Because they love to talk about how they see the world. TAGLE: Charles, could we practice? DUHIGG: Of course. TAGLE: Within three questions. OK. DUHIGG: OK. TAGLE: Charles, what did you do this weekend? DUHIGG: You know, I was in Los Angeles, and I flew back on Saturday. TAGLE: Why were you in LA? DUHIGG: Oh, so I was out there - I was actually promoting my book. I was going on podcasts, and I was talking to folks. And, kind of - it was kind of amazing because I used to live in LA and a chance to go out there and be back there - it's changed so much, but it sort of felt like home in a strange way. TAGLE: Oh, lovely. What do you love about LA? DUHIGG: Ah, you know, the thing I love about LA is it's like 20 different cities in one, right? There's - and so many parts of the cities are so different from each other. There's Koreatown, and there's Chinatown, and there's downtown. There's all these different parts of LA, and as you move through them, you get to experience those cultures in a way that even in a place like New York, it's hard to do. It's just - it's a really dynamic city. And you pick up so much energy just from being on the streets and talking to people. TAGLE: Totally agree. Totally agree. I'm actually - I'm from LA, and I've been... DUHIGG: Oh, are you? TAGLE: Yeah, I am. I'm from LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, and then I went to UCLA and hung out in Westwood for a little while. And every place I've lived in LA has felt like a substantially different place than the LA that I was at previously. DUHIGG: And it's fun, right? It's like you get to go around the world by driving, you know, three miles. It's amazing. TAGLE: Absolutely. I mean, when the three miles takes 45 minutes, I feel a little bit less enthused at times... DUHIGG: Right. That's true. That's true. TAGLE: ...But you're right. DUHIGG: ...That's true. Well, and what I love about what you just did is that you looped me. You - rather than me - waiting for me to ask you, where did you grow up? You built on what I was saying, to say, oh, I actually know LA. I grew up in LA. I can share with you things about LA. We can share this together. And that means, A, I know that you were listening to me, but, B, it means that in addition to sharing who I am, I get to learn something about you, which is that you also like that energy and you love - you like being in Los Angeles, but that, much like me and probably most people, the traffic is not ideal - right (laughter)? - that you probably value your time more than more than just being in a place that's exciting. And so only took us three questions, but I feel like we know each other. TAGLE: I agree. I feel like we did OK, Charles. Thank you. I was nervous about that. DUHIGG: (Laughter). TAGLE: Thank you. Thank you for the positive feedback. See how easy that was? Just listening and responding as yourself can help you really connect. So takeaway four - be authentic. DUHIGG: One of the things that we know about supercommunicators is that they have a couple characteristics - people who are consistently supercommunicators. They tend to ask 10 to 20 times as many questions as everyone else. But the questions are kind of throwaway questions. A lot of them are, like, you know, what do you think about that, or what happened next? So that we don't even hardly register them as questions. They tend to laugh more because they want to show us that they want to connect. But most importantly, they are authentic. So if you say something that indicates that you're struggling with something, they authentically listen to you and they might share something about themselves, or they might ask you a question about that. But they don't try and force something that's false. They don't try and imply that that they're curious, but the reason that they're asking what happened is because they really want to talk about what happened to them. And so the more that we can be authentic with each other, the more that we can listen to what we're feeling and thinking, the more paradoxically we get better listening and in speaking in ways that other people want to listen to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, supercommunicators, let's recap. Takeaway one - communication is about connection, and a learning conversation is a great way to get on the same wavelength with someone. Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone - practical, emotional, social - then match accordingly. Takeaway three - ask lots of questions. Remember, supercommunicators tend to ask 10 to 20 more questions than everyone else, and deep questions will build connection quickly. If nothing comes to mind right away, start with why. Takeaway four - be authentic. You don't have to be an extrovert or comedian to really connect with people. Just lead with your curiosity and don't be scared to be vulnerable. Remember, being a supercommunicator isn't just for the elite few. DUHIGG: Any of us can become a supercommunicator. The reason I wrote the book is because it's just a set of skills that anyone can learn, and when we learn them and when we use them, we begin connecting with other people in this profound way that makes our life so much more meaningful and ultimately makes us healthier and happier and more successful.

Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a worsening water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with the current year being one of the driest on record.

provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/will-pakistans-defence-overhaul-strengthen-or-upset-its-military-balance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"03:40:25+00:00","title":"Will Pakistan’s defence overhaul strengthen or upset its military balance?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which radically overhauls the military command structure by granting lifetime immunity to top military leaders, creating a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) role held by the Chief of Army Staff (Field Marshal Asim Munir), and abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC).

This effectively gives the army chief command authority over the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and Pakistan Navy (PN).\n\nThe incumbent COAS is  Field Marshal Asim Munir , who  assumed command  in November 2022 and was elevated to a  five-star rank on May 20  this year, just 10 days after Pakistan ended its  four-day conflict  with India.\n\nMunir became only the second Pakistani military officer – after Field Marshal Ayub Khan in the 1960s – to receive the five-star designation. The air force and navy have never had a five-star official so far.\n\nThe amendment also abolishes the office of Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) at the end of this month. The role is currently held by four-star General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, who retires on November 27. Another major change is the creation of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (CNSC), a post overseeing Pakistan’s nuclear command. The position will be limited to only an army officer, appointed in consultation with the CDF, with a three-year term extendable by another three years.\n\nThe amendment effectively transforms five-star titles from what were honorary recognitions into constitutionally recognised offices with expansive privileges.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, five-star officers will enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution and will “retain rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life.”\n\nRemoving a five-star officer will require a two-thirds parliamentary majority, whereas an elected government can be dismissed by a simple majority.\n\n“While government spokespersons refer to these titles as ‘honorary’, given to ‘national heroes’ to celebrate their services,” Reema Omer, a constitutional law expert, said, the amendment “implies actual power, not just honorary significance”.\n\nOmer told Al Jazeera that lifelong immunity from criminal proceedings was “concerning from a rule of law perspective”.\n\nA former three-star general, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the changes appeared to be “meant to consolidate” the army chief’s power.\n\nHours after the president’s ratification on Thursday evening, Pakistan’s government brought amendments to the laws governing the three services.\n\nUnder the revised Army Act, the clock on the tenure of the army chief will now restart from the date of his notification as CDF.\n\nLast year, parliament had increased the tenure of the service chiefs from three to five years, which meant Munir’s term would run until 2027. Following the new changes, it will now extend even further. Once the revised rules take effect at the end of this month, Munir will hold both posts – COAS and CDF – at least until November 2030.\n\nSince independence in 1947, Pakistan’s military, especially the army, has been the most powerful institution in national life.\n\nFour coups and decades of direct rule have been accompanied by significant influence, even when civilian governments have been in power. The army chief has long been widely viewed as the country’s most powerful figure.\n\nNo prime minister has ever completed a full five-year term, while three of four military rulers have governed for more than nine years each.\n\nGeneral Qamar Javed Bajwa, Munir’s predecessor, acknowledged this history in his  farewell address in November 2022 , conceding that the military had interfered in politics for decades, and promising to break with that legacy.\n\nBut three years later, rights groups and opposition parties allege that little has changed, and some claim that the  military has further strengthened  its grip over state institutions.\n\nThe military restructure under the 27th Amendment also comes six months after  Pakistan’s brief conflict with India  in May, raising questions over whether the reforms were linked to that fight.\n\nAqil Shah, professor of international affairs at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, argued that the confrontation with India created the opening for this “unprecedented role expansion” for the army chief.\n\nThe changes “formalise the army’s de facto hegemony over the other two wings of armed forces in the guise of the ‘unity of command’ as a necessity for war fighting,” Shah told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut supporters of the amendment disagree. Aqeel Malik, state minister for law and justice, said that the amendment aims to “plug holes” in Pakistan’s national security architecture.\n\n“The amendment granted constitutional cover to defence integration and improved coordination. We have also provided a constitutional cover to the honour bestowed upon our national heroes and have addressed a long overdue cohesive and better coordination within the forces for a swift response,” Malik said.\n\nAhmed Saeed, a former vice admiral, similarly described the reform as a “forward-looking institutional change”.\n\nHe said the conflict with India exposed that Pakistan’s command model was rooted in a 1970s framework, unsuitable for “multi-domain, hybrid warfare of the 21st century”.\n\n“The amendment is not about ‘fixing what is broken’ but about modernising what is functioning to ensure sustained effectiveness in future contingencies,” Saeed told Al Jazeera.\n\nOther critics, including former senior officials and security analysts, believe the amendment is less about modernisation and more about institutional consolidation.\n\nThey argue that creating the CDF post cements the army’s dominance over the other branches.\n\nMany question why the command structure should be overhauled when, by the government’s own narrative, the existing system delivered what Pakistan claims was an  “outright victory”  against India.\n\nA retired three-star general who served in senior roles before retiring in 2019 said the abolished CJCSC role, despite being largely symbolic, provided a mechanism for balancing perspectives across the army, navy and air force.\n\n“The PAF and PN may lose autonomy in strategic planning and most probably senior promotions, which has the potential to breed resentment,” he said.\n\n“These risks institutional imbalance, undermining the very cohesion the amendment claims to enhance,” the former general added.\n\nThe CJCSC – a four-star post and the principal military adviser to the prime minister – can theoretically be filled by any service, but the last non-army officer to hold the position was Air Chief Marshal Feroz Khan in 1997.\n\nSecurity analyst Majid Nizami said that while the amendment aims to codify five-star ranks, it may create challenges for “cohesion and synergy” among the services.\n\nIf the goal was to modernise warfare strategy, he argued, there should have been a dedicated officer focused solely on integration, not the army chief assuming dual authority.\n\n“There is a lack of clarity on rules and terms of reference for the CDF,” Nizami said.\n\nShah, the Georgetown academic and author of The Army and Democracy, said the amendment “formalises the de facto power” of the COAS over the other branches.\n\nSaeed, the former navy official who retired in 2022, however, disagreed with critics, arguing that the amendment simply clarifies the CDF’s strategic coordination role.\n\n“The amendment retains the PAF and PN’s distinct command structures within their domains of responsibility, and the CDF’s function is limited to integration at the strategic level, not administrative control or operational interference,” he said.\n\nHe added that claims of “army dominance” stem from “legacy perceptions, not from constitutional reality.”\n\nThe amendment also codifies the army’s control of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, including research, development and deployment, responsibilities that fall under the strategic command structure.\n\nThe former three-star general who spoke to Al Jazeera said the new system’s operational details remain unclear. Under the current model, the Strategic Plans Division (SPD) manages Pakistan’s  ballistic and cruise missile  programmes and nuclear assets.\n\nNizami said that although the CJCSC nominally oversaw the SPD, operational authority has long rested with the army. The amendment now formalises this reality.\n\nSaeed, however, countered by arguing that in effect, even with the changes, “the entire nuclear enterprise operates under civilian-led oversight with constitutional clarity”.\n\nCritics have described the amendment as a  “constitutional surrender”  by political parties to the military, and an attempt to institutionalise the “supremacy of the uniform over the ballot”.\n\nIt also comes at a time when Field Marshal Munir’s public profile has risen significantly. He has undertaken  multiple foreign trips , including  several  to the United States, and  has been described  by President Donald Trump as his “favourite field marshal”.\n\nMeanwhile, former Prime Minister Imran Khan, jailed for the past two years, accuses Munir of orchestrating the crackdown on him and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), since their ouster in 2022 through a no-confidence vote – a charge that the military has rejected outright.\n\nIn Pakistan’s  February 2024 election , the PTI was barred from contesting as a party. But its candidates, contesting independently, secured the most seats even though they failed to secure a majority. Instead, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed the government with allies. The government and military rejected widespread accusations of election rigging.\n\nShah argued that the political class supported the amendment out of necessity.\n\n“Lacking democratic legitimacy and faced with the political challenge posed by the PTI and Khan, the ruling PML-N government sees Munir as the key guarantor of their power and political interests,” he said.\n\nNizami, the Lahore-based analyst, meanwhile, said that separate appointments to the posts of the CDF and the army chief would have made more sense if the intent was to strengthen the military structure and balance. The amendment, he warned, could lead to “institutional imbalance instead of institutional synergy”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through the solar system, which was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the DNA double helix, has died at the age of 97.

The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) opened in Belem, Brazil, with world leaders calling for united action against climate change.

Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations  climate change conference (COP30)  has started in the Brazilian city of Belem, with leaders calling for countries to take a united approach against global warming.\n\n“In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told delegates on Monday.\n\nSome 50,000 people from more than 190 countries are expected to attend the 12-day event, which is being held at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.\n\nAddressing the conference, Stiell said that previous climate talks had helped, but that there was “much more work to do”.\n\nThe UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone.

nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5311920","dateOfPublication":"2025-04-05","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Want to raise bilingual kids?

First, let go of a common myth \n         By Julia Furlan \n        \n           Saturday, April 5, 2025 • 4:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When journalist  Conz Preti  brought her three children to visit family in Argentina in 2022, her four-year-old son did something surprising. \"He just started fluently speaking in Spanish with my family, with no hesitation, no mistakes,\" Preti says. In their house, she speaks to her children in Spanish and her husband speaks to them in English. But up until that point, her son   \"never, never talked to me in Spanish. Suddenly, it clicked,\" she says. Raising bilingual kids can feel like a challenge — especially on top of so many other things parents worry about.  But with \"consistency, exposure and practice, practice, practice,\" it's possible to successfully teach your child two or more languages, says  Liliana Diaz , a bilingual speech-language pathologist who is raising her two kids to speak Spanish and English. No expensive language lessons or language immersion school required. \"Children are like sponges absorbing everything they're seeing and hearing,\" says  Farwa Husain , a bilingual speech-language pathologist who is raising her three children to speak Hindi, Urdu and English. Whether you want your kids to learn your heritage language or the French you mastered in college, Diaz and Husain offer expert, parent-approved advice on how to cultivate a multilingual household. Let go of a common misconception  Some parents worry that teaching their child multiple languages will set them back or confuse them. But that's a myth, Husain says. According to a 2013 article in the journal  Learning Landscapes , kids who speak two languages are  not more likely  than kids who speak one language to \"have difficulties with language, to show delays in learning or to be diagnosed with a language disorder.\" The article also notes that \"code-mixing,\" or using two languages in the same sentence, is often  interpreted as confusion . It's actually a \"normal part of bilingual development,\" and even a sign of \"bilingual children's ingenuity,\" according to the researchers. In fact, being bilingual can come with several benefits. Studies have shown it can improve  cognitive function ,  help with multitasking  and boost  academic achievement . Pick a language strategy for your family  There are many effective ways to incorporate multiple languages with your kids at home. Pick an approach that works for your family, Diaz says. Our experts recommend a few techniques from the field of bilingual-speech language pathology. One parent, one language . Each caregiver speaks one language consistently with the child. For example, one parent speaks with the child in Mandarin and the other speaks in Hindi consistently at all times. Time and place . The family decides that, say, on Sundays, at breakfast or when they're at grandma's house, they will speak the minority language. Minority language at home . Everybody will speak the minority language at home, and then as the child goes to school, they're exposed to the majority language.  Mixed languages at home : Caregivers and kids all speak all languages simultaneously at home. It may sound confusing, but it works well in practice, Husain says. \"Children are able to decipher very quickly what each language is.\" Whichever technique you decide on, stick with it, say our experts. \"That's what it takes to learn a language,\" Diaz says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Create an immersive language environment at home There are many small, constructive ways to incorporate multiple languages into your day-to-day life. The exposure can add up, according to our experts. Here are a few ideas: Do the activities you're already doing with your kids in the second language.  \"Whether that's listening to music in the car, watching cartoons on TV, going on playdates or  reading,\" Diaz says. Aim for \"consistency, not perfection.\" Video-call relatives.  \"Being able to FaceTime a grandparent, sibling or cousin and have that back and forth with them in another language is so important,\" Husain says. \"You're building those same skills as if you're doing it in person.\"  Celebrate cultural events.  Providing children with the cultural context around their second language can make language learning more fun. Diaz makes a point to celebrate Día de Los Muertos with her two children so they have a connection to their Mexican heritage. \"Language is culture, which is identity,\" Foster curiosity.  Preti says she and her husband, who is fluent in French, \"always play and experiment with language with the kids. The other day, they wanted to know how to say some words in French, and were starting to pick up the similarities between Spanish and French.\"  Embrace imperfection  There will be times when your child just wants to speak the dominant language or mix their dominant and non-dominant languages together, and that's OK, our experts say. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Don't force it, Diaz says. \"If you want them to speak in a particular language at the moment,\" acknowledge what the child is saying first \"then model and respond in that language.\" If your child is code-mixing, don't try to correct them, Husain says. Instead, use it as an opportunity to engage.  Diaz says she loves when her son tries \"to carry one language over to the other. Sometimes he'll say these mixed English-Spanish words, and I'm like, 'Oh, that's a good one. I never thought of saying it that way.'\"  And have some patience. Preti says sometimes her kids will tell her they don't understand her when she's speaking to them in Spanish. \"I'm like, 'But you understand what I'm saying right now?' And they're like, 'Yeah.' And I'm like, 'Well, this is Spanish.'\"  Eventually, your child will get it, even if they don't realize it.  This episode was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

2025-11-04T15:09:09+00:00\n\nTitle: Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is enforcing a comprehensive ban on social media platforms for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7rlrzq88wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:24:44.702+00:00","title":"Nigeria cancels mother-tongue teaching in primary schools and reverts to English","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigeria has reversed its three-year policy of teaching primary school students in indigenous languages, reinstating English as the official medium of instruction from pre-primary through university.

2025-11-13T15:24:44.702+00:00\n\nTitle: Nigeria cancels mother-tongue teaching in primary schools and reverts to English\n\nThe Nigerian government has announced it is cancelling a controversial policy that mandated the use of indigenous languages for teaching in the earliest years of schooling instead of English.\n\nEducation Minister Tunji Alausa said the programme, introduced just three years ago, had failed to deliver and was being scrapped with immediate effect.\n\nInstead, English will be reinstated as the medium of instruction from pre-primary levels through to university.\n\nThe now-defunct programme was launched by former Education Minister Adamu Adamu, who had argued that children learnt more effectively in their mother tongue.\n\nAt the time, Adamu argued that pupils grasped concepts more readily when taught in \"their own mother tongue\" - a view supported by numerous UN studies on early childhood education.\n\nNigeria's education system is facing serious problems, such as poor-quality teaching, inadequate materials, low pay for teachers and numerous strikes.\n\nAlthough 85% of children go to primary school, less than half complete their secondary education.\n\nSome 10 million children are out of school in Nigeria, more than in any other country, according to the UN.\n\nAnnouncing the reversal of the language policy in the capital, Abuja, Dr Alausa pointed to poor academic results from those areas which had adopted mother-tongue teaching.\n\nHe cited data from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the National Examinations Council (Neco), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).\n\n\"We have seen a mass failure rate in WAEC, Neco, and Jamb in certain geo-political zones of the country, and those are the ones that adopted this mother tongue in an over-subscribed manner,\" the minister stated.\n\nThe abrupt cancellation of the policy has drawn a mixed response from education specialists, analysts and parents.\n\nSome have hailed the government's decision, agreeing that the implementation was problematic and contributed to falling standards.\n\nOthers, however, believe the policy was abandoned prematurely. They argue that such a significant shift requires substantial investment in teacher training, the development of textbooks and learning materials, and a longer timeframe before it can be fairly judged and begin to bear fruit.\n\nEducation expert Dr Aliyu Tilde praised the reversal, saying Nigeria isn't ready for such a move.\n\n\"Does Nigeria have trained teachers to teach in the dozens of indigenous languages in the country? The answer is no. Also the major exams like WAEC, Jamb are all in English and not in those mother tongue languages.\n\n\"I think what's needed to improve the quality of our schools is bringing in qualified teachers,” he told the BBC.\n\nA mother who has two children in early education schools, Hajara Musa, said she supported the reversal as it would help young children to learn English at an early age.\n\n\"English is a global language that is used everywhere and I feel it's better these kids start using it from the start of their schooling instead of waiting for when they are older,” she told the BBC.\n\nHowever, social affairs analyst Habu Dauda disagreed.\n\n“I think it was scrapped prematurely instead of giving it more time. Three years is too little to judge a big shift such as this - the government ought to have added more investment,\" he said.\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing challenge in Nigeria of balancing the promotion of its rich linguistic heritage with the practical demands of a national curriculum and a globalised economy where English proficiency is dominant.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv22qjq8eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"23:01:22.448+00:00","title":"Suneung: Blind students sit 13-hour college entry exam in South Korea","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In South Korea, the annual Suneung (College Scholastic Ability Test) is a high-stakes exam that determines university admission and future life outcomes.

Suneung: Blind students sit 13-hour college entry exam in South Korea\n\nEvery November, South Korea comes to a standstill for its infamous college entrance exam.\n\nShops are shut, flights are delayed to reduce noise, and even the rhythm of the morning commute slows down for the students.\n\nBy late afternoon, most test-takers walk out of school gates, exhaling with relief and embracing the family members waiting outside.\n\nBut not everyone finishes at that hour. Even once darkness has fully settled and night has set in, some students are still in the exam room - finishing close to 10pm.\n\nThey are the blind students, who often spend more than 12 hours taking the longest version of the Suneung.\n\nOn Thursday, more than 550,000 students across the country will sit for the Suneung - an abbreviation for College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in Korean. It is the highest number of applicants in seven years.\n\nThe test not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can affect their job prospects, income, where they will live and even future relationships.\n\nDepending on their subject choices, students answer roughly 200 questions across Korean, mathematics, English, social or natural sciences, an additional foreign language, and Hanja (classical Chinese characters used in Korean).\n\nFor most students, it is an eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams. They begin the Suneung test at 08:40 and finish around 17:40.\n\nBlind students with severe visual impairments, however, are given 1.7 times the standard testing duration.\n\nThis means that if they take the additional foreign language section, the exam can finish as late as 21:48 - nearly 13 hours after it began.\n\nThere is no dinner break; the exam continues straight through.\n\nThe physical bulk of the braille test papers also contributes to the length.\n\nWhen every sentence, symbol and diagram is converted into braille, each test booklet becomes six to nine times thicker than the standard equivalent.\n\nAt Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Han Donghyun is among the students who will take the longest version of the Suneung this year.\n\nLast year, there were 111 blind test-takers nationwide - 99 with low vision and 12 with severe visual impairments like Dong-hyun - according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation.\n\nDong-hyun was born completely blind and cannot distinguish light.\n\nWhen the BBC met him at his school on 7 November, his fingers moved quickly across a braille practice booklet of past exam questions.\n\nWith just a week left before the test, he was focused on managing his stamina and condition. Dong-hyun will take the exam using braille test papers and a screen-reading computer.\n\n\"It's really exhausting because the exam is so long,\" he said. \"But there's no special trick. I just follow my study schedule and try to manage my condition. That's the only way.\"\n\nDong-hyun said the Korean language section is particularly difficult for him.\n\nA standard test booklet for that section is about 16 pages - but the braille version is roughly 100 pages long.\n\nEven with screen-reading software, spoken information disappears as soon as it is heard, unlike text that can be seen and re-read. Dong-hyun has to hold the details in his memory as he goes.\n\nThe mathematics section is no easier.\n\nHe must interpret complex graphs and tables that have been converted into braille, using only his fingertips.\n\nStill, he noted that things are better than they used to be. In the past, students had to do almost all calculations in their heads. But since 2016, blind test-takers have been allowed to use a braille notetaker, known as Hansone.\n\n\"Just like sighted students write out their calculations in pencil, we enter them in braille on the Hansone to follow the steps,\" he said.\n\nAnother student at Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Oh Jeong-won, who will also sit the Suneung this year, said the late afternoon is \"the hardest point\" of the day.\n\n\"Up until lunch, it's manageable,\" he said. \"But around 4 or 5pm, after English and before Korean History, that's when it gets really tough.\n\n\"There's no dinner break,\" he explained. \"We're solving problems during the time we would normally eat, so it feels even more exhausting. Still, I keep going because I know there will be a sense of accomplishment at the end.\"\n\nFor Jeong-won, the fatigue is compounded by the need to stay intensely focused with both his hands and his hearing.\n\n\"When I'm reading the braille with my fingers and also taking in information through audio, it feels much more tiring than it does for sighted students,\" he said.\n\nBut the students say that the length of the exam and the long study hours are not the hardest part. What is most challenging is access to study materials.\n\nPopular textbooks and online lectures that sighted students rely on are often out of reach.\n\nThere are very few braille versions, and converting materials into audio requires having text files - which are difficult to obtain. In many cases, someone has to manually type out entire workbooks to make them usable.\n\nOnline lectures also pose difficulties, as many instructors explain concepts using visual notes, diagrams and graphics on screen, which cannot be followed through audio alone.\n\nOne of the most significant barriers, however, is the delay in receiving braille versions of the state-produced EBS preparation books - a core set of materials closely linked to the national exam.\n\nBecause of this delay, blind students often receive the materials months later than others.\n\n\"Sighted students get their EBS books between January and March and study them for the whole year,\" said Jeong-won. \"We receive the braille files only around August or September, when the exam is just a few months away.\"\n\nDong-hyun shared the same concern.\n\n\"The braille materials weren't completed until less than 90 days before the exam,\" he said. \"I kept wishing the publication process could be faster.\"\n\nThe National Institute of Special Education, which produces the braille version of EBS exam materials, told the BBC that the process takes at least three months for each book because it must follow relevant guidelines.\n\nThe institute added that it is \"making various efforts to ensure that blind students can study without disruption, such as producing and providing the materials in separate volumes.\"\n\nThe Korean Blind Union said it has long raised this issue with authorities, and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding greater accessibility to braille versions of all textbooks.\n\nFor these students, the Suneung is not just a college entrance exam - it's proof of the years they have endured to get where they are.\n\nJeong-won described the exam as \"perseverance.\"\n\n\"There's almost nothing you can do in life without perseverance,\" he said. \"I think this time is a process of training my will.\"\n\nTheir teacher, Kang Seok-ju, watches students go through the exam every year - and said the blind students' endurance is \"remarkable\".\n\n\"Reading braille means tracing raised dots with your fingertips. The constant friction can make their hands quite sore,\" he pointed out. \"But they do it for hours.\"\n\nMr Kang urged his students to value completion rather than regret.\n\n\"This exam is where you pour everything you've learned since the first grade into a single day,\" he said. \"Many students feel disappointed afterwards, but I just want them to leave knowing they did what they could.\n\n\"The exam is not everything.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq1e1d79lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"02:26:08.576+00:00","title":"Sheikh Hasina: Ex-Bangladesh leader says she's not guilty of crimes against humanity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s former prime minister, denies allegations of committing crimes against humanity during a deadly crackdown in 2024 that led to her ousting.

last year's uprising that ousted her, days before the special tribunal trying her is due to deliver a verdict.\n\nHasina is accused of being the main architect behind hundreds of killings during the mass protests against her autocratic rule - an allegation she denies.\n\nIn her first interview with the BBC since she fled the country on 5 August 2024, she said her trial in absentia was a \"farce\" orchestrated by a \"kangaroo court\" controlled by political opponents.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty for Hasina if she is found guilty on Monday.\n\nHasina claimed the trial was destined to deliver a \"pre-ordained guilty verdict\".\n\nSecurity has been tightened in and around the tribunal in the capital Dhaka ahead of Monday's verdict.\n\nIt will mark a significant moment for the country as well as for the relatives of those killed during the student-led anti-government protests that ousted Hasina.\n\nUN human rights investigators have said  up to 1,400 people were killed when Hasina and her government used systematic, deadly violence against protesters in the failed bid to hold onto power.\n\nThe former prime minister has refused to return from India to attend the trial.\n\nShe has been accused of personally ordering security forces to fire at protesters in the weeks before she fled.\n\nIn an email interview, Hasina told the BBC she \"categorically\" denied such allegations.\n\n\"I'm not denying that the situation got out of control, nor that many lives were lost needlessly. But I never issued any order to fire on unarmed civilians,\" she said.\n\nLeaked  audio of one of her phone calls verified by  BBC Eye earlier this year suggested that she had authorised the use of \"lethal weapons\" in July 2024.  The audio was played in court during the trial.\n\nHasina was formally indicted along with two others in July this year. They are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun.\n\nProsecutors have sought the death penalty for the former, who is in hiding. The latter pleaded guilty in July but has not been handed a sentence.\n\nSpeaking about the trial, Hasina said she hadn't been able to defend herself or appoint her own lawyers.\n\nShe added her political opponents had gone after her in an attempt to \"liquidate\" her Awami League party as a political force.\n\nLawyers representing her issued a statement on Monday saying they had filed an urgent appeal to the UN raising serious fair trial and due process issues at the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Awami League is already banned from standing in general elections due in February.\n\nThe BBC interview also covered other serious allegations of abuses committed during Hasina's 15-year rule, which will be heard in another case at the special tribunal. Hasina denies charges of crimes against humanity in that case too.\n\nAfter Hasina was ousted from power, a number of secret jails were discovered holding prisoners who had been detained for years without any legal process. Many other critics and opponents of Hasina who had been abducted or held in these prisons are alleged to have been killed unlawfully.\n\nAsked who was responsible for this, Hasina said she \"did not have knowledge\" of them.\n\nShe also denied her involvement in alleged extra-judicial killings and disappearances, which rights group say she was responsible for as the head of government during her leadership.\n\n\"This is denied in terms of my own involvement, but if there is evidence of abuse by officials, let us have it examined properly in an impartial, depoliticised process,\" she said.\n\nHasina and other senior members of her former government are also facing trial for corruption in a separate court, charges they deny."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1z5ppq8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"01:11:12.879+00:00","title":"Max Klymenko wins TikTok creator of the year for career ladder series","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The second annual TikTok Awards, hosted by TV presenter Aj Odudu at Magazine London, celebrated diverse content creators across 12 categories, including fashion, travel, food, education, and mental health advocacy.

teaching people how to raise an autistic child were among the winners of the second annual TikTok awards.\n\nHosted by TV presenter Aj Odudu at Magazine London, awards were handed out in  12 categories including fashion, travel, food and education.\n\nAnd taking home the coveted prize of creator of the year was Max Klymenko, who is best known for his career ladder series, which he says is the most popular non-animated show in the world.\n\nIn case you've not seen it, Max sets up his stepladder in various public spaces and invites passers-by to join him standing on the ladder while he tries to guess their career with a series of yes/no questions.\n\nMax came to the UK from Ukraine 14 years ago and said the reason he started creating content was because he found it impossible to get a job to get his own career going.\n\n\"I had a lot of anxiety and stress around finding a job so I created videos helping people know what jobs were available to them.\" Gold ladder in hand, Max, who has 8.5 million followers on TikTok, dedicated his award to his grandma in Ukraine who \"has no electricity to follow along\".\n\n\"I'm calling her right after this,\" he said, explaining that she used to log-in from different TikTok accounts when he first started creating content so it looked like he had more views.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who accepted his award from last year's winner Kyra-Mae Turner added that he was grateful his content was being recognised because \"everything you see when you scroll on the toilet or in bed takes hours to make\".\n\nThe nominees have a combined follower count of more than 83 million and the winners were voted for by five million people on the app.\n\nWinning the award for video of the year was Bemi Orojuogun, better known as bus aunty.\n\nOften seen smiling silently on TikToks as she stands at the side of a road or a depot – while a passing double-decker appears to narrowly miss hitting her – Orojuogun has turned her lifelong love of the London's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.\n\nHer winning video has been viewed almost 50 million times and she now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea.\n\nThe mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admitted: \"It's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me,\" but said is she is proud of what she's achieved.\n\nShe thanked Transport for London and Stormzy, saying that he propelled her to fame after re-posting one of her videos.\n\nThe 56-year-old grandma had a wonderful night making friends - including Nikki Lilly, the winner of the fashion and beauty creator of the year.\n\nNikki, who has 10 million TikTok followers, told the BBC that fashion, beauty and lifestyle content can be seen as \"skin deep\" but her content challenges those perceptions.\n\n\"I don't want to only make my social media a highlights reel,\" the 21-year-old said. \"It's also me having surgeries, a chronic illness and me having a facial difference.\"\n\nAfter being diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, a rare life-threatening medical condition, at age six, she has used her platform to raise awareness and inspire others.\n\n\"As someone with a facial condition, I've never felt fully embraced in this space,\" she said while accepting her award. But she added, she has now found \"so much safety\" in the TikTok beauty world.\n\nAnother advocate creator is Tola and Kevin who won the \"voice for change\" award.\n\nTola and Kevin are a mother-son duo behind an account that posts candid videos of what it's like to raise a young adult with autism, striving to create content that raises awareness and promotes acceptance.\n\nIn tears, Tola said she was so grateful for the award and explained she started the account because she felt isolated when her son was first diagnosed with autism 16 years ago.\n\nShe's since built an \"amazing community who love and support Kevin\" which has helped the both of them immensely.\n\nOne of the most recognisable winners of the night was Charley Marlowe, a Radio 1 presenter, who won entertainment creator of the year.\n\nIf you don't know her, you're likely to know her famous cackle which has become her trademark.\n\nOn the red carpet earlier in the night she told me \"Win or lose, we're on the booze, so I'm having a good night anyway.\"\n\nShe was in shock to have won the award and dedicated it to \"every northern, working-class diva.\"\n\nCreator of the year  - Max Klymenko\n\nEntertainment creator of the year  - Charley Marlowe\n\nFood creator of the year  - Kieran Monlouis\n\nSport creator of the year  - Lissie Mackintosh\n\nFashion and beauty creator of the year  - Nikki Lilly\n\nTravel creator of the year  -  Phil Carr\n\nBooks & learning creator of the year  - Gabriel Astorga\n\nVoice for change creator of the year  - Tola and Kevin\n\nStoryteller of the year  - Morgan M James\n\nRising star creator of the year  - Joy Anokwuru\n\nVideo of the year award  - Bemi Orojuogun\n\nArtist of the year  - Olivia Dean"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/indigenous-activists-storm-cop30-climate-summit-in-brazil-demanding-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:16:29+00:00","title":"Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including members of the Tupinamba community and leaders like Gilmar and Leo Cerda, protested at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding the protection of Amazon rainforest territories from agribusiness, oil exploration, and logging.

COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62012e6g9lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:17:46.188+00:00","title":"Deadly Rio police raid failed to loosen gang's iron grip, residents say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A large-scale police operation in Rio de Janeiro on 28 October 2025, targeting the powerful Comando Vermelho (CV) gang, resulted in 121 deaths, including four police officers.

details which have emerged in the aftermath of Brazil's deadliest police operation are casting doubts over whether the raid really struck at the heart of one of the country's most powerful criminal gangs, as was its stated aim.\n\nOne hundred and twenty one people, among them four police officers, were killed in the raid on 28 October in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Claudio Castro, described the police operation as \"a success\", posting a photo showing the more than 100 rifles seized by police.\n\nBut rights groups have sharply criticised the security forces pointing to the high death toll and what they have described as the \"brutality\" of their actions.\n\nThe operation was the largest ever carried out by Rio's security forces and saw 2,500 officers deployed to the Alemão and Penha neighbourhoods.\n\nIt targeted the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) criminal gang, which rules over the nine-million-square-metre area.\n\nRio's public safety secretary, Victor dos Santos, told Reuters that the goal of the operation had been to carry out scores of arrest warrants issued by prosecutors.\n\nBut when BBC Brasil cross-checked the list of the deceased published by police against the 68 names on the list of suspects provided by prosecutors, it found that none of them matched.\n\nLocal media have also pointed out that even though scores of suspects were arrested during the raid, the man considered the gang's most powerful leader, Edgar Alves de Andrade, also known as Doca, was not among them.\n\n\"Early reports stated that the goal of the operation was to capture high-ranking leaders of the Comando Vermelho (CV),\" Carlos Schmidt-Padilla, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, told BBC Brasil.\n\n\"By that metric, it is fair to say the operation failed.\"\n\nAt a Senate hearing, the deputy intelligence secretary for Rio's military police  stated that the raid had had a \"negligible\" impact on dismantling Comando Vermelho.\n\nResidents of the Alemão and Penha have also told the BBC that it has done little to loosen the tight grip the CV has on their favelas.\n\nThey said that their daily lives had barely changed since the mega-operation, describing seeing armed men roaming the community the very next day, even as the bodies of those killed were still being removed.\n\nComando Vermelho (CV) and groups like it enforce strict rules in the areas they control.\n\nThese criminal enterprises have moved beyond the sale of drugs and now hold the monopoly for the provision of gas, cable television, internet and transport.\n\nResidents report being charged over the odds for gas cylinders, often having to pay one third more than in zones not under gang control.\n\nRules imposed by gang members affect everyday life.\n\nAs CV has banned cars working for ride-hailing apps from entering the favelas, locals are restricted to using motorbike taxis and vans which have been authorised by the gangs to operate there.\n\nEven people's clothing is policed by the gang. In 2020, residents of Penha were told not to wear Chelsea football shirts.\n\nAt the time, the jerseys were sponsored by British telecoms company Three, but CV members did not like the number being prominently displayed because it reminded them of a rival gang which happened to have the number three in its name: Terceiro Comando Puro (Pure Third Command).\n\nPunishments for what are considered transgressions are extremely harsh.

They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".\n\nThe emails were obtained by the committee after it subpoenaed Epstein's estate as part of its own probe into the federal investigation of Epstein.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\n\n\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\".\n\nEpstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".\n\nMaxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"\n\nThe victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\".\n\nThe White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre,  a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year . In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".\n\nGiuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse.  And in a memoir released this year , she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.\n\nAsked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.\n\nIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who   - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office.\n\nIn a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".\n\nEpstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nWolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\n\"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.\n\nA third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.\n\nIn it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\".\n\nEpstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\".\n\nResponding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nAs well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.\n\nHe responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.\n\nAndrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"\n\nMaxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.\n\nThe right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.\n\nOn 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.\n\nLord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.\n\nThey show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016 , according to the documents.\n\nThe latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAn email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".\n\nLord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".\n\nEpstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.\n\nEpstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.\n\nLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.\n\nAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released.\n\nIn it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"\n\nFarmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zkrplpdyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"22:11:44.539+00:00","title":"Swiss deploy charm offensive in bid to slash crippling Trump tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Switzerland is engaging in a high-stakes diplomatic effort to reduce President Donald Trump's 39% tariff on its exports, the highest in Europe.

slashing US President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Switzerland's exports to the US – the highest rate in Europe.\n\nInitial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind fell on deaf ears. But a visit on 4 November by business leaders appears to have changed his mind.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters on Thursday that the talks between the US and the Swiss ministers were \"very positive\" and \"very focused\", adding that they are \"very aware\" of their trade deficit with the US and are prepared to address it.\n\nFor months the Swiss have been trying to bring down the rate, which has hit Switzerland hard.\n\nTrump's response to the Swiss president's bid was that she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".\n\nBut last week's private business initiative adopted a more unconventional approach.\n\nSwiss industry chiefs came to the Oval Office on 4 November bearing gifts,  including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS.\n\nAlready this week Trump has said a deal is being worked on to bring the tariffs \"a little bit lower… I haven't set any number\".\n\nAfter their talks the Swiss industrialists said in a statement \"our entire initiative was undertaken in the spirit of Swiss unity between the private and public sectors\".\n\nSome business figures, particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.\n\nIn September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour.\n\nThe president, apparently guessing what was going on, even asked if Dufour would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.\n\nLast week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.\n\nIt is quite normal nowadays for any leader heading to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of Trump's German grandfather's birth certificate.\n\nRequests for confirmation of the gifts to the two Swiss companies involved brought a \"no comment\" from Rolex and MKS.\n\nBut days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nA White House official confirmed the two items had been given to Trump.\n\nThe US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department.\n\nThey are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.\n\nIn 1969, President Richard Nixon gently refused the gift of a Swiss Omega watch to commemorate the Moon landings.\n\nWhatever happens to the Swiss gifts, Trump's stance towards the Swiss appears to be softening, telling reporters he is working on something \"to help Switzerland\".\n\nSwiss economy minister Guy Parmelin and chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda, who travelled to Washington on Wednesday, are more hopeful than they have been in months, amid suggestions that 39% tariff may be reduced to 15% - the same as Switzerland's neighbours in the EU.\n\nIn return, promises from the Swiss pharmaceutical giants to build more production plants in the US are already on the table. It is also reported that Swiss International Airlines, whose fleet is primarily Airbus, may pivot towards Boeing.\n\nBut will it be enough? Swiss industry is waiting with bated breath. The tariffs are beginning to bite, with a number of Swiss companies warning they will have to furlough staff if nothing changes.\n\nThe Swiss do have one more highly influential figure they can call on.\n\nFifa president and Swiss citizen Gianni Infantino, long a friend of Trump's, was reportedly urged by some Swiss parliamentarians to try to change the president's mind.\n\nAs part of preparations for next year's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, Infantino visited the Oval Office in August bearing the trophy.\n\nAs the cameras rolled he handed it to Trump saying he was \"a winner\". The president responded asking \"can I keep it? That's a beautiful piece of gold\".\n\nInfantino has also announced a brand new Fifa world peace prize, to be announced in Washington DC on 5 December.\n\nAll bets are off as to who that might be."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7pj543eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"03:16:48.227+00:00","title":"Canadian boycott of US travel shows no sign of slowing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since President Donald Trump's re-election in early 2025, Canadians have significantly reduced their travel to the United States in protest of his trade policies, including 35% tariffs on Canadian goods and public statements suggesting Canada should become the '51st state'.

2025-11-14T03:16:48.227+00:00\n\nTitle: Canadian boycott of US travel shows no sign of slowing \n\nKristy Gammon used to travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.\n\nBut those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\n\n\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.\n\nMs Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nOctober marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.\n\nOverall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.\n\nAs relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.\n\nIn the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.\n\nThey began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.\n\nCanada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.\n\nTrade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.\n\nMeanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".\n\nSome popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US.\n\nIn Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\n\n\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.\n\nMajor events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.\n\nStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.\n\nSome of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.\n\nMs Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\n\n\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"\n\nMs Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\n\n\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpkerdn9qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"21:59:46.844+00:00","title":"Germany agrees new military service plan to boost troop numbers","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany’s coalition government has agreed to a new military service plan aimed at expanding the Bundeswehr from 182,000 to 255,000–260,000 troops over ten years.

2025-11-13T21:59:46.844+00:00\n\nTitle: Germany agrees new military service plan to boost troop numbers\n\nGermany's coalition government has agreed a new military service plan to boost troop numbers following months of wrangling between political forces.\n\nThe new military service plan will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their suitability to serve and, from 2027, to undergo medical screening.\n\nThe decision comes as Berlin aims to create Europe's strongest conventional army.\n\nThe boss of Germany's biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, has told the BBC he believes that target could be met in five years.\n\nLawmakers are expected to vote on the plan by the end of 2025.\n\nArmin Papperger said Chancellor Friedrich Merz's aim to boost the Bundeswehr was \"realistic\" and he told the BBC that \"clear decisions\" were coming from government.\n\nEarlier this year German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer warned that the Western Nato alliance had to prepare for a possible Russian attack within four years.\n\nMr Papperger said he had \"no glass ball\" about the future but agreed Germany had to be \"ready in '29\".\n\nWhen they formed a coalition earlier this year, Merz's conservative CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrat SPD agreed to re-introduce military service which would be voluntary \"to start with\".\n\nThe Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops. The new military service model aims to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year, rising to between 255,000 and 260,000 over the next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists.\n\nFrom next year, all 18-year-old men and women will be sent a questionnaire to assess their interest and willingness to join the armed forces. It will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.\n\nFrom July 2027 all men aged 18 will also have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for duty.\n\nIf the government's targets are not met, a form of compulsory enlistment could be considered by parliament. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.\n\nSome within Germany's political left remain deeply opposed to mandatory service.\n\nMany young Germans are wary and a significant majority oppose it. A recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine suggested while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds.\n\n\"I don't want to go to war because I don't want to die or I don't want to be shot at,\" said Jimi, a 17-year-old student from Berlin, who attended an anti-conscription protest outside the Bundestag earlier this week. \"I also don't want to shoot people.\"\n\nAn attack against Germany was an \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" that the government was using to legitimise \"stealing millions of young people's right to decide what they should be doing\", he said.\n\nMeanwhile, 21-year-old Jason signed up as new Bundeswehr recruit earlier this year because of the current \"security situation\".\n\n\"I wanted to contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if the worst happens,\" he said. By joining up he felt he was \"giving back to society\" but also believed in the deterrent potential of the army, \"so potential enemies don't even think about attacking you\".\n\nDefence Minister Boris Pistorius has sought to reassure Germans, saying that despite the new military service plan there was \"no cause for concern... no reason for fear\".\n\n\"The more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces are, through armament through training and through personnel, the less likely it is that we will become a party to a conflict at all,\" Pistorius said.\n\nDefence spending in Germany tumbled after the end of the Cold War, while conscription was suspended in 2011.\n\nGiven its past, Germany has long been shy of showing military might, but earlier this year Friedrich Merz announced that the rule for German defence \"now has to be whatever it takes\", following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNato countries across Europe have come under pressure from President Donald Trump's White House to hike spending.\n\nEuropean moves to re-arm have meant significant revenue for Rheinmetall.\n\nIts CEO, Armin Papperger, whose firm also supplies Ukraine, said: \"We make a lot of money because there is a huge demand.\"\n\n\"We have to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we have to have our own satellite competencies. We do much more on the electronics and artificial intelligence... than ever before,\" he said.\n\nA US report last year suggested the Rheinmetall boss had been the target of a Russian assassination plot. There was no confirmation at the time and Mr Papperger would not be drawn on the report, saying: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\"\n\nAsked about whether he felt Europe was in a state of a cold or hybrid war, he said: \"Whatever you call it, it's not a peaceful time.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglgj08erywo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:38:43.121+00:00","title":"Epstein email says Andrew had photo taken with Virginia Giuffre","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A newly released 2011 email from Jeffrey Epstein, addressed to his publicist Peggy Siegal, appears to confirm that Virginia Giuffre was on his plane and photographed with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

I can't take any more of this my end.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday went on to publish its story alongside the photograph.\n\nIt included allegations that girls were directed to sit on Andrew's knee at Epstein's New York home, that he groped them and took part in sexual encounters on Epstein's private island.\n\nThe documents also reveal attempts by Epstein to discredit Ms Giuffre's testimony.\n\nIn the July 2011 email to his publicist, Epstein also wrote: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think Buckingham Palace would love it.\n\n\"You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro [sic].\"\n\nThe latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in the US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.\n\nA Democrat on the House Oversight Committee - Congressman Suhas Subramanyam - told BBC Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee.\n\nHe said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\".\n\nAndrew  was stripped of all his titles  earlier this month after Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir renewed interest in his ties to Epstein and Maxwell."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd679n9lnx5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:04:12.187+00:00","title":"Steam Machine: Valve rivals Xbox and PlayStation with new console","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Valve, the creator of the Steam gaming platform, has unveiled a new home console called the Steam Machine designed to allow PC games to be played on a television in the living room.

PlayStation with new console\n\nValve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nThe Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.\n\nIt is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.\n\nPrices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.\n\nThe Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.\n\nThe company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.\n\nSince Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.\n\nAround 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.\n\nBut whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year.\n\nAnalysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched  in its original, clunkier form a decade ago  - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam \"power users\".\n\nIn a video announcement, Valve described the new console as \"a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package\".\n\nThe firm argues the device is \"optimised for gaming\" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.\n\nPowered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.\n\nBut industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a \"lucrative but niche\" audience of \"around four to five million players\".\n\n\"Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,\" he said.\n\n\"My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting.\".\n\nIn an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.\n\nThe device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a \"streaming-first\" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.\n\nAnd it also claims to be bringing   a technical leap forward in the VR space, with the headset displaying highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen a user is looks at.\n\nWith the sweeping new device announcements, Valve hopes to rival its more established competitors.\n\nIn recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.\n\nMeanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking  when its successor will appear on the market .\n\nBrandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's \"strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want\".\n\n\"With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,\" he told the BBC.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

on Thursday said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.\n\nThe agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador come as US President Donald Trump faces scrutiny over his handling of the economy and concerns about affordability.\n\nAs part of an initial framework, a reciprocal tariff of 10% will stay on goods from Guatemala, Argentina and El Salvador, as will a 15% rax on imports from Ecuador into the US. But the deals will exempt products that cannot be produced in the US \"in sufficient quantities,\" such as coffee.\n\nThe US-Argentina deal also addresses beef producers' access to foreign markets.\n\nTrump previously downplayed concerns about cost of living, insisting the outlook had improved during his nine months in office. He said affordability was a \"new word\", and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nBut he has  focused on the issue  with some urgency since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's off-year elections across a handful of states.\n\nThis week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to lower coffee prices, which have jumped about 20% in the US this year. Bessent also signalled relief on tariffs on bananas and other fruits.\n\nSenior administration officials on Thursday singled out coffee, cocoa and bananas as examples of imports from the four Latin American countries that are poised to escape tariffs.\n\nGuatemala and Ecuador are the biggest exporters of bananas to the US.\n\nWhile the US does import coffee from Central American countries including Guatemala, Brazil is the top coffee exporter to the US, according to data from the Agriculture Department, and is not covered by the deal.\n\nSevere weather is also contributing to high prices for coffee and cacao, senior administration officials said. But they added that prices will hopefully fall to some extent when tariffs ease, if retailers and wholesalers pass along savings to consumers.\n\nSeparately, in a joint statement announcing a framework deal with Argentina, the White House focused on expanding access to beef markets overseas.\n\nThe two countries \"have committed to improved, reciprocal, bilateral market access conditions for trade in beef\", according to the statement.\n\nThe soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he asked the Justice Department to  investigate meat-packing companies  over their possible role in driving up beef prices, after other recent proposals to lower prices  sparked backlash  among ranchers.\n\nThe four agreements with Latin American trading partners are expected to be signed within the next two weeks, senior administration officials said.\n\nThe deals stem from Trump's announcement in April of sweeping new tariffs on dozens of countries. Most were put on hold amid the resulting global financial panic.\n\nNations considered the \"worst offenders\" would face higher rates, as payback for what the Trump administration has called unfair trade policies. New tariff rates for dozens of countries were subsequently introduced in August, after delays to allow for trade talks.\n\nThe Trump administration has in recent weeks reached trade agreements with the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnerkx5pgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:33:11.303+00:00","title":"Israel receives body Hamas says belongs to hostage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has confirmed receiving a body from Hamas, which claims it belongs to a missing Israeli hostage, marking progress in the first phase of a ceasefire deal brokered by the United States.

The commission released a list of 74.2 million voters in September, weeding out 4.7 million names.\n\nThe exercise - which is now taking place in 12 states and federally administered territories across India - was sharply criticised by the opposition.\n\nThey accused the commission of dropping many voters, especially Muslims, to aid Modi's party.

puffin comeback 'proves restoration works'\n\nPuffins have been seen on the  Isle of Muck  in County Antrim for the first time in years, after a major scheme to remove invasive brown rats.\n\nIt is the first time the vulnerable seabird has been recorded on the tiny island off Islandmagee since Ulster Wildlife took over the management of the seabird sanctuary 25 years ago.\n\nA programme of rat eradication began in 2017 and winter grazing has now been implemented to keep vegetation low, so predator cover is reduced.\n\nThe charity's nature reserves manager Andy Crory said the discovery of the puffins \"proves seabird restoration works\".\n\nFive puffins were spotted in 2024. Then in spring this year, cameras set up as part of the rat eradication programme caught two puffins coming and going from a nesting burrow on the cliff ledges.\n\nTheir behaviour, bringing food back to the nest, was a positive sign that they were breeding.\n\nFor Mr Crory, tales of puffins once breeding on the Isle of Muck \"felt more like folklore\", but the myth is now becoming a reality.\n\n\"Seabirds face immense challenges globally, with 24 of the 25 breeding species at risk of local or global extinction,\" he said.\n\n\"So, while a handful of puffins on a tiny island may seem small, this moment is huge – it proves that seabird restoration works.\"\n\nThe puffin sightings are the latest in a long line of positive signs of the impact conservation management has been having on the island.\n\nAnnual surveys have begun to record steady increases in eider ducks, guillemots, herring gulls and lesser-backed gulls on and around the island, year on year.\n\nIt is not known for certain that the puffins seen this year managed to successfully rear a chick.\n\nBut Mr Crory is staying positive.\n\n\"Our hope is that the Isle of Muck will become a thriving stronghold for puffins and, in time, tempt back other lost species like the Manx shearwater.\n\n\"For now, we're waiting with great excitement to see if the first 'pufflings' – baby puffins – appear on the cliffs next summer.\n\n\"That truly would be the icing on the cake.\"\n\nPuffins are a priority species in Northern Ireland and red-listed in the UK, putting them in the highest conservation concern bracket due to food shortages, climate change, and predation by invasive species.\n\nThey spend most of their lives at sea, only returning to land to breed in spring and summer at the same nesting site with the same partner, year after year.\n\nEach pair raises a single chick during the breeding season.\n\nUlster Wildlife said rats are a major issue for many seabird islands across the UK, posing a threat to eggs and chicks.\n\nThe Isle of Muck is not accessible to the public and it is hoped that isolation will help the birds to return safely next summer.\n\nSimilar rat removal projects have been carried out elsewhere to help seabirds bounce back.\n\nThe LIFE Raft project on Rathlin Island is expected to have  rid the island of the predators  when it publishes its latest report soon.\n\nFerrets have already been cleared from Rathlin in a  world-first project ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4y4z169go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"00:07:36.936+00:00","title":"Will AI mean better adverts or 'creepy slop'?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"AI is transforming digital advertising by analyzing users' public online activity—such as social media posts, search history, and ChatGPT interactions—to infer personality traits like introversion or extroversion.

night, you're scrolling through social media on your phone, and the ads start to look remarkably familiar. They're decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use.\n\nWelcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI.\n\nAdvertising company Cheil UK, for example, has been working with startup Spotlight on using large language AI models to understand people's online activity, and adapt that content based on what the AI interprets an individual's personality to be.\n\nThe technology can then mirror how someone talks in terms of tone, phrase and pace to change the text of an ad accordingly, and insert music and colours to match, say, whether the AI deems someone to be introverted or extroverted, or have specific preferences for loud or calm music, or light or dark colours.\n\nThe aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them.\n\nBrands in retail, consumer electronics, packaged goods, automotive, insurance and banking are already using the technology to create AI-enhanced, personality-driven ads to target online shoppers.\n\nThe AI is able to read what people post on public platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and other public forums - as well as someone's search history, and, most importantly, what people enter into ChatGPT.\n\nThen, with what it deduces about an individual's personality, the AI overlays that on top of what advertisers already know about people. For example, what part of the country you live in, what age bracket you're in, whether you have children or not, what your hobbies might be, where you go on holiday and what clothes you like to wear - information brands can already see through platforms like Facebook or Google.\n\nThat's why the jeans you've been searching online for magically appear in your inbox as a sponsored ad, or the holiday you've been searching for seems to follow you around the internet.\n\nThe difference is now AI can change the content of those ads, based on what it thinks your personality is, thanks to what it's been reading about you. It targets individual people, rather than the demographic segments or personas advertisers would traditionally use.\n\n\"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level,\" says Cheil UK CEO Chris Camacho.\n\n\"You've now got AI systems that can go in and explore your entire digital footprint - your entire online persona, from your social media interests to what you've been engaging in.\n\n\"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that's when you start to build a picture understanding that individual, so whether they're happy, whether they're sad, or what personal situation they're going through.\"\n\nAn added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output.\n\nResearchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes.\n\nThe study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn't mind that it had been written by AI.\n\n\"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it's still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile,\" explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research.\n\n\"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done],\" he adds.\n\nPersonalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising 'wastage' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go.\n\n\"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they've already forgotten it,\" says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible.\n\n\"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop.\"\n\nIvan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way.\n\n\"There's also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with,\" says London-based Mr Mato.\n\n\"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn't whether brands can personalise everything - it's whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do.\"\n\nAI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges.\n\n\"There's going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there's going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths,\" he says.\n\n\"And that's the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next.\n\nBut Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics.\n\n\"We don't have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We're trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We're trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that's all we've ever tried to do.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874nw4g2zzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"22:01:10.532+00:00","title":"BBC apologises to Trump over Panorama edit but refuses to pay compensation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a mis-edited clip from his 6 January 2021 speech, which falsely implied he called for violent action in a Panorama episode.

Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained   lots of voices in support of Trump.\n\nFinally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.\n\nA BBC insider said that internally, there is a strong belief in the case the corporation has put forward, and in its defence.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the BBC was accused of another misleading edit of Trump's 6 January 2021 speech, two years before the Panorama sequence aired.\n\nOn a Newsnight programme from 2022, the edit is a little different from Panorama.\n\nTrump is shown as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\"\n\nThis was followed by a voiceover from presenter Kirsty Wark saying \"and fight they did\" over footage from the Capitol riots.\n\nResponding to the clip on the same programme, former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who quit a diplomatic post and became a critic of Trump after describing the 6 January riots as an \"attempted coup\", said the video had \"spliced together\" Trump's speech.\n\n\"That line about 'we fight and fight like hell' is actually later in the speech and yet your video makes it look like those two things came together,\" he said.\n\nIn response to Thursday's story in the Telegraph, a BBC spokesperson said the BBC holds itself to the \"highest editorial standards\" and the matter was being looked into.\n\nA spokesman for Trump's legal team told the Telegraph it was \"now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump\".\n\nConcerns over the Trump Panorama documentary emerged when  a leaked internal memo , written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee, was  published by the Telegraph newspaper .   Among other things, the document also criticised the BBC's reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/nyregion/new-jersey-sports-gambling-mob.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:32:19-05:00","title":"New Jersey Accuses Mob-Led Ring of Running Illegal Sports Gambling","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New Jersey law enforcement has accused Joseph M.

fisherman who, his family said, had long plied the Caribbean in search of marlin and tuna, called his teenage daughter. He told her he was going fishing, she said, and would return in a few days.\n\nHe never made it back.\n\nThe day after he left, on Sept. 15, his family, fellow fishermen and Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, say Mr. Carranza was killed in a U.S. military strike on his boat. The furor about what happened to him  has ignited a feud over the huge U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and the legality of the deadly attacks on nearly 20 vessels since September.\n\nCaribbean Sea\n\nSanta Marta\n\nThe New York Times\n\n“I never thought I would lose my father in this way,” said Cheila Carranza, 14, this week, holding back tears as she gazed at a photo of him on her phone in her grandmother’s crowded home, where she lives in one room with her mother and two siblings.\n\nAs the death toll climbs from U.S. strikes on boats in waters near Latin America, tensions are increasing with Colombia, which had long been a top U.S. ally in the region. So far, 19 U.S. strikes have killed at least 76 people.\n\nThe attacks have enraged Mr. Petro, who accused the United States of murdering Mr. Carranza in one attack. President Trump responded by imposing sanctions on Mr. Petro and his family and moving to slash aid to the country. This week, Colombia suspended intelligence sharing with the United States until the Trump administration stops its strikes.\n\nThe Trump administration claims the attacks occurred on boats carrying illicit drugs that kill thousands of Americans. But many legal experts in the United States and elsewhere say the strikes violate international law because those killed, even if they had been suspected of committing any crimes, did not present an immediate threat.\n\nMangled bodies have begun washing up on the beaches of Trinidad and Tobago after U.S. strikes in the region. The only two known survivors of the strikes are not from Venezuela, but Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nThe Trump administration has called Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, the leader of a drug cartel and has privately said that the goal of the U.S. deployment, the largest in decades in Latin America, is to push the authoritarian leader from power.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided evidence, aside from descriptions of intelligence assessments and declassified portions of video images, that any of the vessels it has destroyed were carrying drugs. At the same time, in Mr. Carranza’s case, there is no immediate ability to determine with certainty if he was simply a fisherman or had been involved in drug smuggling.\n\nMr. Petro, in a news conference last month, said Mr. Carranza was from a traditional fishing family, but “may have been involved very intermittently’’ with drugs.\n\nMany fishermen in coastal and island communities, he said, become involved in drug transport because poverty leaves them few alternatives.\n\nThe strikes have left Mr. Carranza’s family reeling and grasping for answers, offering a rare glimpse into the strain the U.S. deployment can inflict on those left behind as the toll from the deadly attacks continues to climb. The family has hired an American lawyer, who said he was preparing a legal claim.\n\nKaterine Hernández, the mother of three of Mr. Carranza’s children, disputed Mr. Trump’s claim that the strike that killed her former partner, along with two other people on the same boat, had targeted “confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela.”\n\n“Alejandro had nothing to do with Venezuela; he spent his entire life here in Colombia,” said Ms. Hernández, 37, in an interview in Santa Marta, a sun-drenched city on Colombia’s northern coast where she met Mr. Carranza when she was 13.\n\nMr. Carranza, 42, also occasionally took jobs piloting boats for others in the waters around Santa Marta, his family and other fishermen said, raising the possibility that the boat he was in was transporting something illicit with or without his knowledge.\n\nBut Ms. Hernández said that Mr. Carranza had never been involved in smuggling drugs. “If he was some kind of narcoterrorist,” she said, “then why are we living in misery instead of a mansion?”\n\nDespite separating several years ago, Ms. Hernández said, she and Mr. Carranza remained close. Until recently, she and the children had lived with his parents. While he rarely earned more than Colombia’s monthly minimum wage, about $382, she said, he always put food on the table for her and the children.\n\nNow, Ms. Hernández said, they were subsisting on the kindness of relatives who themselves have next to nothing. She and the three children are living in her mother’s home in Gaira, a gritty area of Santa Marta not far from the city’s glistening beaches.\n\nDan Kovalik, an American lawyer hired by Mr. Carranza’s family, said that even if Mr. Carranza had been suspected of piloting a boat carrying illicit drugs, it would have been illegal to kill him.\n\n“If the people on the boat were suspected of drug trafficking, they should have been arrested, not killed,” said Mr. Kovalik, who plans on filing suit in the United States and seeking damages for Mr. Carranza’s family.\n\nThe identities of the other two men aboard the boat remain unknown.\n\n“This case is important from two points of view,” Mr. Kovalik added. “First, the family deserves compensation for the loss.”\n\n“Second, we want this case to help stop these killings from taking place again,” Mr. Kovalik said. “This is murder, and it is destroying rule of law.”\n\nThe Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince Mr. Carranza departed on the fishing trip two months ago, Ms. Hernández said, their lives have been shattered.\n\nBefore the U.S. strike, she said, she had already been unable to work after a motorcycle accident severely damaged her right leg — near the place on her ankle where she still has Mr. Carranza’s first name, tattooed.\n\nThe school fees for Zaira, their 17-year-old daughter, have gone unpaid, she said, while their son, Libiston, 11, was traumatized after another child showed him the video shared by Mr. Trump, apparently showing the father’s boat being blown to pieces.\n\nMs. Hernández said that some people had questioned whether Mr. Carranza had even been killed at all since his body has not been recovered. Others have tried to insinuate that he was involved in drug smuggling, she said, because of a previous brush with the law.\n\nIn a case from 2012, Mr. Carranza had taken part in a scheme to steal weapons that had been confiscated in legal proceedings, according to Colombian officials. Ms. Hernández and Adenis Manjarres, 30, Mr. Carranza’s first cousin, both said that Mr. Carranza had never been jailed in connection to the case. Colombian officials did not have more information on the disposition of the case.\n\nLeonardo Vega, 40, a longtime friend of Mr. Carranza’s who is the leader of a fisherman’s association in Santa Marta, said he was certain that Mr. Carranza was killed in the Sept. 15 strike.\n\nUpon seeing the attack on social media, Mr. Vega said that the type of boat in the video was precisely the kind used by fishermen from Santa Marta, in contrast to differently designed boats departing from Venezuela.\n\n“I immediately thought, ‘He’s one of ours,’” said Mr. Vega. He added that the destroyed boat had two motors instead of the three or four used on boats typically used to smuggle drugs or other contraband.\n\nFishermen can be gone for a week or so, often sleeping in hammocks on deserted beaches, he said.\n\n“But two months gone, no way,” Mr. Vega added. Looking at factors like the dates of Mr. Carranza’s departure and that of the U.S. attack, along with the boat seen in the video, he said he could come to only one conclusion: “Sadly, my friend is dead.”\n\nMr. Vega said Mr. Carranza had been well known for his easygoing personality among other fishermen in Santa Marta. He was known by the nickname “Coroncoro,” which refers to a small fish typically found in the area, and enjoyed drinking beer and playing pool.\n\nBeyond what Mr. Carranza’s family is grappling with, the U.S. strikes have struck fear among Santa Marta’s fishermen, Mr. Vega said, and made them reluctant to do their work.\n\nIt is now tuna season, he said, usually one of the most lucrative times for fishermen to head out. But fears of what might await them there has virtually ground fishing to a standstill, he added.\n\nGenevieve Glatsky and Simón Posada contributed reporting from Bogotá, Colombia.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:31:29.785+00:00","title":"China and Japan in escalating spat over Taiwan: What to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a significant diplomatic escalation between China and Japan over Taiwan, triggered by Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggesting Japan could activate its self-defence forces in response to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

escalating war of words.\n\nIt all started when Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that if China attacked Taiwan then Japan could respond with its own self-defence force.\n\nSince then, foreign ministries on both sides have lodged serious protests with the other, with Beijing summoning the Japanese ambassador. A Chinese diplomat also made what some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi.\n\nThe spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of Taiwan.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\n\n\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.\n\nA \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.\n\nTakaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".\n\nOn Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".\n\nWhile the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.\n\nTokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.\n\nXue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on.\n\nThen on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\".\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness.\n\nSun called Takaichi's remarks \"extremely wrong and dangerous\" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that \"otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan\".\n\nJapan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan \"has not changed\" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,\" he said during the daily news briefing.\n\nKihara also added that Japan \"strongly urged China to take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media comment.\n\nThere is a longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.\n\nHistorical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe ,  suggests more tensions may lie ahead.\n\nThe conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.\n\nTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan.\n\nShe had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.\n\nChina is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.\n\nOn the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nIn 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".\n\nIn this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\n\n\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\n\n\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/science/blue-origin-launch-rocket.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:12:23-05:00","title":"Blue Origin to Launch NASA’s ESCAPADE Mission to Mars: How to Watch","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Blue Origin is attempting to launch its New Glenn rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to carry NASA’s ESCAPADE mission — two spacecraft named Blue and Gold — on a journey to Mars for studying the planet’s magnetic field and atmosphere.

Watch\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T11:12:23-05:00\n\nNew Glenn, the powerful orbital rocket built by Blue Origin, the space company founded by Jeff Bezos, is still on a launchpad in Florida after postponed launch attempts on Sunday and Wednesday. The rocket is ready for its second mission.\n\nTucked inside the rocket is NASA’s ESCAPADE mission — two identical spacecraft that will orbit Mars to measure the dynamics of that planet’s magnetic field and atmosphere.\n\nBut that is only one goal for the launch. Blue Origin will attempt on Thursday to land the rocket’s booster stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic, a feat that only Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX, has so far achieved.\n\nLiftoff from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida is scheduled for Thursday afternoon during an 88-minute launch window that begins at 2:57 p.m. Eastern and ends at 4:25 p.m.\n\nBlue Origin is providing online coverage of the launch, starting 20 minutes before liftoff.\n\nSunday’s launch was postponed because of poor weather over the launchpad, and then Wednesday’s flight was called off.\n\nOn Wednesday, the weather cleared. The rocket was ready, as was ESCAPADE.\n\nThen space weather intervened.\n\nOn Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, the sun shot off three coronal mass ejections — gargantuan belches of high-speed charged particles — that headed in the direction of the Earth. Two of those merged and slammed into Earth’s magnetic field on Tuesday, generating colorful light shows in the night sky.\n\nThe energetic particles also wreak havoc on electronics.\n\nThe radiation from Tuesday’s bombardment was beginning to die down, and the launch would have gone ahead, said Rob Lillis, the principal investigator for ESCAPADE.\n\nBut then came word that the third mass coronal ejection would strike at the time that ESCAPADE was heading out on its own.\n\nThe key worry was that the geomagnetic storm would crash the computers of the spacecraft, preventing the solar arrays from deploying and killing the spacecraft.\n\nThat third coronal mass ejection turned out not to be a monster, but there was no way to know that ahead of time.\n\nAt 321 feet tall, New Glenn is a giant. It is taller than the Falcon 9 rockets regularly flown by SpaceX, but shorter than the Starship vehicle the company is testing in Texas.\n\nThe rocket is named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth.\n\nIts payload nose cone, at seven meters wide, offers at least twice as much space for payloads as other rockets currently in operation.\n\nThe booster stage — the lower part of the rocket that lifts off the ground and carries the upper stage through the densest part of the atmosphere — is designed to land and to be reused.\n\nAfter it propels the rocket up through the dense, lower part of the atmosphere, the giant New Glenn booster stage will drop away and try to set down on a floating platform named Jacklyn, after Mr. Bezos’ mother.\n\nThat boat is already positioned about 375 miles off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nYes, SpaceX regularly recovers the booster stages of its Falcon 9 rockets, then reflies them, a feat it first accomplished a decade ago. Since then, SpaceX has successfully landed the boosters more than 500 times. One of its boosters has flown 31 times.\n\nNo other company has landed a stage of an orbital-class rocket. Blue Origin does land and reuse the boosters of its much smaller New Shepard rockets, which send tourists and science experiments on up-and-down, suborbital flights to the edge of space, but not to orbit. Reusing the booster stage of New Glenn will be key to speeding the pace of launches if Blue Origin is to become a serious competitor to SpaceX.\n\nIn the near future, a Chinese company, Landspace, is also aiming to land the booster of its new Zhuque-3 rocket, which, at first glance, looks like a clone of the Falcon 9.\n\nThis rocket is carrying ESCAPADE, or Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers, a NASA-financed mission developed by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. The mission consists of two identical spacecraft named Blue and Gold — the school colors of Berkeley.\n\nThe two spacecraft will take a long, slow trip to Mars, arriving in September 2027. After they reach their destination, Blue and Gold will spend at least a year orbiting the red planet to take measurements of the magnetic field around it, as well as the dance of charged particles in the thin atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket is also carrying a NASA communications technology demonstration from the company Viasat.\n\nESCAPADE was originally scheduled to launch on the first New Glenn mission in October 2024. However, when it appeared that New Glenn would not be ready in time, NASA decided to pull the mission off that flight and put the spacecraft into storage.\n\nThe first New Glenn finally launched in January, and its primary mission was a success. The payload — a demonstration of Blue Ring, a technology that Blue Origin is developing to move payloads around in space — made it to orbit and successfully completed its tests.\n\nBut the secondary goal of landing the booster was not successful. The booster’s engines failed to reignite as it re-entered the atmosphere, and it crashed into the Atlantic instead of landing on the Jacklyn floating platform.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/opinion/trump-pardons-crimes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:04:02-05:00","title":"Pardon Me.

I Am Not Done Committing Crimes.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:04:02-05:00\n\nLet me tell you about four very different men who share something quite important in common.\n\nOn Monday, a man named Jonathan Braun was sentenced to 27 months in prison. The charges against him included sexually assaulting the live-in nanny for his own children and attacking a nurse with an IV pole. He was also accused of assaulting a 3-year-old child.\n\nIn October, a man named Christopher Moynihan was arrested and charged with threatening via text to “eliminate” Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, at a speaking engagement in New York City on Oct. 20.\n\nIn March, a federal jury convicted a man named Eliyahu Weinstein of defrauding investors of $41 million. As Bloomberg reported, he had falsely promised “to invest their money in Covid-19 masks, scarce baby formula and first-aid kits bound for Ukraine.”\n\nIn January, an Indiana sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a man named Matthew Huttle when he reportedly raised a firearm during a traffic stop. Huttle was being arrested for a felony traffic violation when he resisted arrest. A special prosecutor charged with investigating the case said the deputy’s use of force was “legally justified.”\n\nFour different men. Four very different crimes. But their common trait is that each of them had previously received a pardon, commutation or clemency from President Trump. And they’re only a small fraction of a larger number. As our newsroom reported this week, at least eight people to whom Trump granted clemency in his first term have since been charged with a crime.\n\nIn addition, “Several others pardoned more recently after being convicted of offenses committed during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have also run into trouble with the law.”\n\nBut the pardons just keep coming. On Sunday, Trump granted sweeping pardons to 77 people who helped him attempt to subvert the 2020 election. Last week, Trump pardoned Glen Casada, the Republican former speaker of the Tennessee House, and Casada’s former chief of staff, Cade Cothren. Both men had been convicted of charges including wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nIn the same set of pardons, Trump also pardoned Robert Harshbarger Jr., the husband of Diana Harshbarger, a Republican representative from Tennessee. As our newsroom reported, Robert had pleaded guilty to “health care fraud and distributing a misbranded drug, in this case kidney medications, some of which came from China, that were not approved for the purpose by the Food and Drug Administration.”\n\nThis is just a partial list of the most notorious and unjustifiable pardons of Trump’s second term so far.\n\nI mentioned one of the most brazen in my column two Sundays ago — the pardon of the crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao.\n\nThe pardon came after Zhao’s company, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal, “took steps that catapulted the Trump family venture’s new stablecoin product, enhancing its credibility and pushing its market capitalization up from $127 million to over $2.1 billion.”\n\nSo what do all of these people have in common? It’s certainly not that they’re deserving of pardons. There isn’t a meaningful claim of actual innocence in the bunch, and in almost every case there’s no meaningful evidence of unusually harsh treatment or unjust sentencing. No, the thing they have in common is they are either allies of Trump and his associates or used connections to Trump or his family (or helped enrich Trump) to get relief from justice.\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to abuse the pardon power. In his last weeks in office, Joe Biden pardoned his son and commuted the sentences of thousands of other convicted criminals. Some of these pardons were defensible, but many were not. As Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The Times in October, “Biden acted over the objections of his own Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice, which performed rigorous scrutiny of the applicants for clemency.”\n\nAll told, Biden granted 80 pardons and 4,165 commutations during his one four-year term, a number, according to the Pew Research Center, that “far exceeds the total of any other president since the beginning of the 20th century, including Franklin D. Roosevelt.”\n\nAny list of Bill Clinton’s most infamous acts also includes pardons. On his last day in office, he pardoned his brother, Roger, from his drug conviction, and he pardoned a fugitive named Marc Rich after Rich’s ex-wife, Denise, gave $450,000 to the Clinton Presidential Library.\n\nGerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon, while not corrupt, was also deeply misguided. It set a precedent of placing American presidents beyond the reach of the law. But Andrew Johnson’s blanket pardon of Confederates was infinitely worse — it cleared the way for their return to state and federal power after the Civil War and helped set the stage for a century of brutal repression of Black Americans in the South.\n\nIn fact, if we’re going to compare Trump to anyone, Johnson is the best match. Just like Johnson, Trump pardoned men who directly attacked American democracy. Unlike Johnson, however, Trump’s pardons are obvious rewards for personal service and for personal connections.\n\nActing just like a corrupt king, Trump is transforming the American system of justice into his personal plaything. Friends of the crown break the law with impunity. Enemies of the crown experience the sharp end of the law, whether they deserve it or not.\n\nWe can’t say we weren’t warned. If there was one element of the American Constitution that set off the most urgent alarm during the founding era, it was the pardon power — Article II’s grant of absolute, unchecked power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”\n\nFor example, at the Virginia ratification convention, George Mason, a founding father and delegate to the Constitutional Convention, was recorded as saying that the president “ought not to have the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself” — a situation that eerily forecasts Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons.\n\nMason was concerned that the president’s pardon power was so great that it could be fatal to the United States. “It may happen, at some future day,” Mason said, “that he will establish a monarchy, and destroy the republic.”\n\nWriting under the pseudonym Cato, an anti-Federalist thought to be the then-New York governor George Clinton warned against the “unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason, which may be used to screen from punishment, those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt.”\n\nAgain, there are echoes of Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, except there was nothing secret about Trump’s misconduct in 2020 and 2021.\n\nWriting under the pseudonym Brutus, an anti-Federalist thought to be Robert Yates, an associate justice of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, warned that the pardon power (among other presidential powers) would be used “to the purposes of gratifying their own interest and ambition, and it is scarcely possible, in a very large republic, to call them to account for their misconduct, or to prevent their abuse of power.”\n\nThe Federalists’ answer to the anti-Federalists was simple — don’t worry, they argued; Congress will impeach a corrupt president. In his response to Mason, James Madison reportedly argued, “If the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any persons, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter himself; the House of Representatives can impeach him: They can remove him if found guilty.”\n\nYes, the House can impeach the president. Yes, the Senate can convict him or her. But the Senate has never convicted an American president, and there is no real hope that it ever will. If history teaches us anything, it’s that impeachment has not checked presidential abuses of power, and it’s hard to imagine that it ever will.\n\nAnd so we remain at risk, and it’s not hard to see how Trump could use the pardon power to break American democracy. His pardons won’t just protect friends and family members who abuse power to enrich themselves, as bad as that is. As his Jan. 6 pardons show, he’ll use the power to excuse even those allies who commit acts of sedition.\n\nI shudder to think of the outright criminality that Trump and his allies could resort to during the 2026 midterms, much less the 2028 presidential election. One doesn’t have to imagine wild fantasies of a Trump third term to imagine systemic abuses of power to suppress or miscount dissenting votes — all to hand power to his chosen successor, who can then enter office free of any federal criminal cloud.\n\nI’m frequently asked about my ideas for legal and constitutional reform. I revere the Constitution, but it’s not a divinely inspired document. Our founders did have blind spots, and it’s quite clear that one of the most glaring was handing too much power to the president.\n\nI know that constitutional amendments sound unrealistic. But we are afflicted with recency bias, tempted to think that our present polarization is a permanent part of American politics. But it is not. We have cycled through episodes of division and unity, and periods of crisis are often followed by periods of reform.\n\nTo give the most salient example, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments that were ratified after the Civil War gave life to Abraham Lincoln’s promise in the Gettysburg Address of a “new birth of freedom.” The amendments were so consequential that they represented a second founding of the United States of America.\n\nAfter Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive presidential terms, we amended the Constitution to term-limit presidents. In the years following Watergate, Congress passed a series of statutory reforms intended to limit presidential power. The Trump era shall pass as well, and those of us who love our American republic should be prepared to close its constitutional loopholes and destroy the imperial presidency once and for all.\n\nHere’s one suggestion: Amend Article II so that it states that the president “shall have Power, with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate, to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”\n\nThe pardon power should exist as a matter of last resort, deployed only when the American legal system has truly failed to deliver justice, or when the national interest in a pardon is overwhelming. The legislative approval should be supermajority so that it’s broadly supported by America’s elected representatives.\n\nAn amendment to the pardon power stands a chance in part because public disgust at presidential pardon abuse is bipartisan. Republicans are furious at Biden. Democrats are furious at Trump. Millions of Americans are disgusted by both men’s pardons — as well as many of the pardons that came before.\n\nTo preserve America’s future, we need to heed the warnings of the past. We can’t dismiss this statement as a mere truism. The fears of the anti-Federalists were rooted in raw truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of unchecked power. And few of those fears were more urgent — or more prescient — than the warning against one of the last vestiges of royalty in American law.\n\nOn Sunday, I wrote about the fight for the soul of the Republican Party and the dark and disturbing rise of antisemitism and even admiration for Hitler in parts of the right. In short, the fish rots from the head:\n\nA movement, especially one that verges on an outright cult of personality, is defined by its leader, not by its rank and file. And when the leader is lawless and depraved, then efforts to contain his influence while preserving his power are doomed to fail.\n\nThe proof is everywhere. Throughout the Trump era, many of the most prominent voices of right-wing America have only become shriller, angrier and, yes, more racist and more antisemitic. The right-wing media universe is culturally different in 2025 than it was in 2015 — substantially so.\n\nThe balance of power has flipped upside down. The fringe has become mainstream, and the mainstream has become fringe.\n\nOn Saturday, my conversation with Michelle Cottle and Jamelle Bouie centered around the 2025 elections. Why did the Democrats do so well? In part because they fielded quality candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. But it’s also because Trump forgot the reason he won:\n\nFrench: The Trump administration in a lot of ways misread its victory in a pretty dramatic fashion. It was not a mandate to pardon all the Jan. 6-ers. It was not a mandate to go after every dissenting law firm in America. It was not a mandate to put masked police all over the streets of American cities and engage in gross and brutal acts of violence out in public on a nearly daily basis. It was not a mandate to engineer military deployments to American cities on obviously false, fake pretext.\n\nSo, look, none of this should be surprising. This wasn’t what he was elected by, the big mass of people who are not MAGA. Now, you will find on Twitter all the time this sentiment where it’s a very brutal video or a very vicious statement from Trump and people will say, “I voted for this.” Or the grainy videos of the drone strikes or the airstrikes in, outside of Venezuela.\n\nCottle: Yeah, but Twitter’s still not real life.\n\nFrench: That’s what I’m saying — that’s not real life. They have convinced themselves it is.\n\nAnd then the other thing here is that unless the Republicans course-correct, unless they get this through their heads, they’re going to continue to have this problem: There’s no sign that the administration itself is really keeping its eye on the public as opposed to this weird, bespoke world of right-wing influencers. This is how they’re gauging themselves a lot, is: How is the right-wing podcast world or the right-wing Twitter world reacting to me? And they’re exquisitely sensitive about that, and they don’t give a rip about normal political metrics and measures and normal political rhetoric.\n\nSo if they keep doing this, we are not on their floor yet. We are nowhere near their floor.\n\nThank you for being a subscriber\n\nIf you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others. They can sign up here.

and Sorrows\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:03:41-05:00\n\nArt history, which likes categories and keeping things neat, has never known what to do with certain artists, Wifredo Lam (1902-1982) being one. Surrealist? Cubist? Latin American? Afro-Asian? Insider? Outlier? Yes. No. Sort of. Maybe.\n\nSo how about we go with Unclassifiably Fabulous Visual Poet? Even a speed-walk through the Museum of Modern Art’s blazingly hallucinatory retrospective, “Wifredo Lam: When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream,” will confirm that, whatever else Lam is, he’s definitely that.\n\nAnd like many artists, he was his own most eloquent explicator. In an interview he said, “I have been considered a painter of the School of Paris, a Surrealist painter, but never as a representative of the painting that I really do and in which I believe I reflect, to a large extent, the poetry of the Africans who came to Cuba, poetry that still hides much pain in its songs.”\n\nOrganized by MoMA’s new director, Christophe Cherix, with Beverly Adams, curator of Latin American Art, and others, the show is the first in the United States to document the full arc of Lam’s career. And it begins, usefully, early, mapping the indirect path that brought Lam to be the artist-poet of his self-description.\n\nHe was born in Cuba in 1902, in a sugar-cane-harvesting region, to an immigrant Chinese father and a mother of West African and colonial Spanish descent. Most accounts of his life add a third parental figure, Ma’ Antonica Wilson, a priestess of the Afro-Cuban religion of Santeria, who served as his spiritual godmother.\n\nHis parents noted his drawing skills when he was young and sent him to art school in Havana. In 1923, he received a government scholarship earmarked for young persons “of color” and traveled to Spain for further study. For some years there he seems to have stuck with academic fare — still life, landscape — and a realist style, with at least one arresting exception in the form of a Fauve-ish painting of an ambiguously gendered dark-skinned figure wrapped in a florid Chinese robe. A self-portrait?\n\nIn 1930 he married and had a child, supporting his new family, precariously, with portrait commissions. Disaster hit. Both his wife and 1-year-old son died of tuberculosis. Grief, it seems, broke Lam down, but also opened him up. He went deeper into art, updating himself on new developments in Paris and the rest of Europe. And he got politically active, joining the Republican army at the start of the Spanish Civil War, a grueling commitment that, in 1937, produced his first major painting.\n\nTitled “La Guerra Civil (The Spanish Civil War),” and done on the cheap, mostly in blue and black gouache on a big sheet of commercial packaging paper, it’s a scene of Fascist troops slaughtering Spanish citizens. The painting style — a chaos of swipes and blotches in a dimensionless space — is half-abstract, but the bad-dream emotion conveyed, of a world in a state of emergency, is specific and strong, a dynamic Lam will recreate in future work.\n\nIn 1938, exhausted, he left Spain for Paris, and there a new story starts. On arrival he is embraced by Picasso and the poets and artists of the Surrealist wave. In quick order, he sets up a small studio, lands a gallery, and scores the sale of brand-new work — a Cubist pieta of a picture called “Mother and Child” (it’s in the show) — to MoMA.\n\nBut World II has now started. German troops are in Paris and the art world is streaming out, heading south to Marseilles and from there across the Atlantic to safety. Camped-out life in Marseilles must have been quite a scene, a big, scared party. Artists and writers passed some of this tense time playing the Surrealist game called “Exquisite Corpse,” in which, collectively, they made composite figurative drawings and collages, with each player contributing a part of the image.\n\nLam participated in the game, and the fantastical, often grotesque imagery that resulted seems to have established a stylistic touchstone for his painting to come. And the sea voyage itself clarified an existing content that was waiting to be revealed.\n\nOn the ship’s first stop, in Martinique, Lam met the Black poet and politician Aimé Césaire, shaper of the Negritude movement. They shared an instant rapport and would become collaborators. And partly because of this bonding, when Lam ended his trip in Cuba, landing there for the first time in 18 years, he was ready, in a way he had not consciously been before, to focus his attention on the Afro-Atlantic culture that was his heritage.\n\nIt was through changed eyes that he saw the tropical island he’d left. Lush and green, it was still a natural paradise, but one despoiled by centuries of Western colonialist racism and greed. In a late-life interview with the Cuban critic and curator Gerardo Mosquera, Lam labeled the art he would make from that time forward “an act of decolonization.” And once back in Cuba he got right down to it, producing, in 1943, the monumental astounder of a picture titled “La Jungla” (The Jungle).\n\nIf spatial depth in “La Guerra Civil” was depicted as an abstract whiteness, like fog, in “La Jungla” it’s all but blocked from view by a crowd of upright figures jammed together against a solid wall composed of stalks of sugar cane, the money crop for which African men, women and children, shipped to the Caribbean as enslaved people, were forced to do the crushing work of harvesting.\n\nBut the figures gathered here, some with faces resembling Picassoid versions of African masks, don’t appear to be slaves. Of indeterminate species, they don’t represent “the Africans who came to Cuba,” but the cultural essence of Africa itself. The picture, with its palette of succulent greens and mango-yellows, is a classical pastorale of a kind Lam knew from European art history, transformed by the energies of the living Afro-Caribbean spirituality he experienced in childhood, without ever becoming a practitioner.\n\nAnd those energies infused almost all the art he made from that point on. They certainly animate the even more spectacular, mural-size painting-on-paper titled simply “Grande Composition.” (Completed in 1949, and recently acquired by MoMA, it’s been out of sight for 60 years, and is being shown in the United States for the first time.)\n\nHere the palette is subdued — black, white and brown; shadow-and-light — but the contents are even more determinedly multicultural, with spiritual power-figures — a horse-headed woman, lifted straight from Afro-Cuban sources — accompanied by images of Native American and Oceanic masks, all set in frieze-like silhouette against a dark ground.\n\nLater, figures will decrease in number and become crazily, almost comically abstract, as in the 1955 painting from which the exhibition takes its name. And then, in a handful of pictures from the late 1950s, they will disappear altogether, replaced by dense  fields of floating lines suggesting smoldering earth, sacrificial pyres and cosmic conflagrations.\n\nPolitical and poetic, ideally mutually inclusive terms, are equally apt descriptions for these paintings, and for all of this cosmopolitan artist’s work and thought. (Lam moved  permanently from Cuba to Europe in 1952, and traveled internationally throughout his life, finally settling in Italy.)\n\nAlthough initially leery of the critical notion of biography-as-destiny — the idea that a lived life might be used as absolute measure of the meaning and worth of what it produced — he understood, at a fairly early point, that the experience of otherness, which was his experience as an Afro-Asian Latino, came with insights and obligations that would and should shape his art.\n\nIn this regard, Lam has much to say to succeeding generations of artists. And the exhibition catalog concludes with a small album-like group show of some who acknowledge his influence, including McArthur Binion, Mel Edwards, Teresita Fernández, Raphael Ferrer, Rashid Johnson, Ana Mendieta and Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons. And to which company I would add the names of two extraordinary Cuban artists now gone, Belkis Ayón (1967-99) and Juan Francisco Elso (1956-88).\n\nAs for “poetic,” Lam adored poetry. He said so again and again. He found it in many forms and places. And poets found it in him. In 1941, André Breton chose Lam drawings to illustrate his book-length poem “Fata Morgana,” creating one of Surrealism’s landmark word-and-image collaborations. Lam later provided illustrations for history-altering poetry books by Aimé Césaire, René Char and Édouard Glissant. And in 1982, the last year of his life, a collaboration was flipped when Césaire, in a gesture of tribute, added his poems to a portfolio of Lam’s prints.\n\nThe MoMA retrospective is also a tribute, though it doesn’t call itself that.\n\nPerfectly proportioned, beautifully installed, it lets a figure who has long been defined by associative labels be the distinctive and peerless artist-poet he was.\n\nWifredo Lam: When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream\n\nThrough April 11, 2026, at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400; moma.org.\n\n"}]}
