PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration moved Thursday to challenge California’s effort to redraw the state’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, throwing the full weight of the Justice Department in the high-stakes battle over control the House of Representatives next year.\n \n\n   \n  After voters in the Golden State approved a ballot measure last week that allows state Democratic lawmakers to replace congressional lines drawn by the state’s independent commission  with new ones  that make five US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the California Republican Party and others raced to court to block the redistricting effort.\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s involvement is a dramatic escalation in the legal challenge, which, if successful, could scramble Democrats’ plan to push back against a nationwide effort by Republicans, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to boost the party’s chance of holding on to their House majority through rare, mid-decade redistricting ploys across several states.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the Trump administration told the federal judge overseeing the case in the Central District of California on Thursday that days after the case was brought last week, the “federal interest” in the matter became clear given the constitutional issues at stake in the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that the redistricting plan was sold to voters as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  “Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,” the Justice Department lawyers wrote in court papers. “Because the Proposition 50 map does, the United States respectfully requests that this court enjoin defendants from using it in the 2026 election and future elections.”\n \n\n   \n  “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,” said Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington took to the floor to launch the process of sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire — which meant that his hand-picked successor was the only person registered to run for his seat.\n \n\n   \n  Gluesenkamp Perez announced on the floor that she intends to force a vote to condemn García for the move, accusing him of “undermining the process of a free and fair election.” She is using special procedural powers — known as privilege — that mean her resolution is likely to get a vote on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement after her floor speech, Gluesenkamp Perez said García is attempting to “anoint an heir.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences. Americans bled and died to secure the right to elect their leaders. We can’t expect to be taken seriously in the fight for free and fair elections if we turn a blind eye to election denial on our side of the aisle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The move by the Washington Democrat shocked her own party. Multiple members told CNN that their party — including leadership — had no idea it was coming. Some were angry, insisting that Gluesenkamp Perez was going after García at an already fragile moment for the Democratic party, which was splintered over the ending of the 43-day government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But some Democrats have also called out García for the timing of his decision not to seek reelection in a way that effectively meant no other candidate could enter the race. That includes Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey — who succeeded former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was forced out of Congress because of a corruption scandal.\n \n\n   \n  “Rep Chuy García’s decision to end his re-election at the last second and plant his chief of staff as the only candidate to succeed him was undemocratic and should not be allowed. Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim  posted on X  after Gluesenkamp Perez announced her petition on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  García announced on November 4 that he would not run again for his House seat, citing the health of his wife, the death of his daughter in 2023 and his formal adoption of his grandchild just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, filed petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections to run for the seat that same day, just ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline for filing. But the congressman had already planned not to run, according to a report by  the Chicago Sun-Times.  (Patty Garcia has no relation to the congressman.)\n \n\n   \n  The congressman addressed the criticism  in an interview  with a local Illinois political publication, Capitol Fax, saying “I think I followed the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  As for his decision, García said many in his family were “begging” him not to run again after the adoption of his grandchild and his daughter’s death two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Those were just really big factors in me deciding that I could not, in good conscience, do it again, and decided in Washington one of those nights that the only recourse we had was to look at an option. And that’s when I thought that we could try to get my chief, Patty Garcia, on the ballot,” García told Capitol Fax.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN for comment, García’s office referred to a statement in which he said he “followed every rule and every filing requirement laid out by the State of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “Congressman García made a deeply personal decision based on his health, his wife’s worsening condition and his responsibility to the grandchildren he is raising after the death of his daughter,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  And some of his colleagues have defended the congressman.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois  called  García an “an unwavering fighter for our democracy and our communities,” in response to the move to sanction him.\n \n\n   \n  “It is disappointing that someone willing to compromise working families’ healthcare would use this moment for a cheap political stunt aimed at distracting people from an indefensible vote on tonight’s CR,” she said, referring to the fact that Gluesenkamp Perez  voted in favor of the bill  to reopen the government, which did not include an extension of expiring health care subsidies – a key demand from Democrats in the funding fight.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/donald-trump-epstein-political-danger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:56:00Z","title":"The Political Danger of the Epstein Files for Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes how newly released emails between Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell reveal alleged connections between Trump and Epstein, including claims that Trump spent time with victim Virginia Giuffre and was aware of Maxwell's recruitment of minors from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

danger of the Epstein files for Trump \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:56 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If  President Donald Trump  has nothing to hide vis-à-vis  Jeffrey Epstein , he sure has a weird way of showing it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the convicted sex offender, but he’s doing a great job of looking suspicious.\n \n\n   \n  And that could be a political problem in and of itself – regardless of whatever ultimately comes from the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  A batch of  newly released Epstein emails  on Wednesday added details about Trump’s past relationship with Epstein but no smoking guns. (The White House said the emails “prove absolutely nothing.”)\n \n\n   \n  In one of those emails from 2011, Epstein expressed surprise to accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump’s name hadn’t surfaced amid accusations involving Epstein. Epstein added that Trump had at one point spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2019, Epstein appeared to signal Trump was quite aware of Maxwell recruiting girls from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 2000s, saying “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  While some have claimed these emails show Trump had knowledge of or even involvement in Epstein’s crimes, it’s not nearly so evident. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has acknowledged meeting Trump and never accused him of wrongdoing. And Trump has acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees including Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. (The big question there is whether Trump had any inkling about what Maxwell was recruiting a minor female like Giuffre  for .)\n \n\n   \n  But also notable on Wednesday was Trump’s reaction.\n \n\n   \n  As all this was going down, he and his White House seemed preoccupied with what appeared to an  11th-hour campaign to thwart  a House discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing the full Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  With the petition due to get a decisive 218th signature when a new Democratic member of Congress was sworn in later that day, the White House held a meeting in the Situation Room with a key GOP lawmaker who’d signed on, while another said she was playing phone tag with the president. Both GOP congresswomen later told CNN Trump hadn’t personally lobbied them to remove their names. But the president also  publicly pressured  Republicans who sided with Democrats on forcing Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  It was a weird move, to be sure. No Republicans removed their names from the petition, and Speaker Mike Johnson quickly said he would schedule a vote for next week on compelling the Justice Department to release the full files.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the measure passes in the House, that’s not the end of the story. The GOP-led Senate would still have to take it up, and Trump would still have to sign it. So it’s not like this will cause the imminent release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s resistance to something his base has long clamored for – and the optics of the Situation Room meeting in particular – would only seem to deepen the huge suspicions that a large number of Americans already harbor about the government covering up Epstein-related matters.\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at the big point here – and the political danger for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  This is merely the latest baffling episode in the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. Among  the others :\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump doesn’t have anything to hide, the danger here is in making it look a whole lot like he does.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are primed to believe there’s a real conspiracy beneath the surface, and Trump’s actions risk making him own it.\n \n\n   \n  The polling tells the tale.\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps Trump’s worst issue, by the margin who disapprove. Americans generally disapprove of his and the administration’s handling of the Epstein matter by around a 3-to-1 margin in most polls. The most recent poll, a Reuters-Ipsos survey from last month, showed Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of it 57%-19%. Independents disapproved 59%-10%.\n \n\n   \n  And like virtually every other survey on the topic, not even a majority of Republicans said they approved: 44%.\n \n\n   \n  Americans are also quite unhappy with the administration’s transparency and disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  An August  Pew Research Center survey  showed 63% of Americans and even 38% of Republican-leaning Americans had little or no trust in what the Trump administration was saying about the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, an  August Quinnipiac University poll  showed voters said 73%-16% that the Justice Department wasn’t being transparent about its investigation.\n \n\n   \n  All of that said, this is clearly not a top-tier issue for most Americans. Relatively few have seemed to be paying close attention. Only about one-quarter were following it “extremely” or “very” closely in the  Pew survey .\n \n\n   \n  But crucially, it’s also something Americans are liable to believe the worst about.\n \n\n   \n  To wit:\n \n\n   \n  That same poll showed even 33% of Republicans said Trump hadn’t gone far enough to get to the bottom of Epstein matters.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, only 26% of Americans and just 55% of Republicans were willing to rule out that Trump had engaged in crime with Epstein. (Trump hasn’t been charged with any crimes related to Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s a lot of Americans who are inclined to believe the worst here – or are at least willing to entertain it. People also seem to have very little confidence and trust in what the administration is doing or saying about all of this.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s conduct just keeps giving them reason to be suspicious.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/chicago-ice-arrests-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:30:00Z","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Illinois Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of 615 individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led immigration crackdown in Illinois between June 2025 and October 2025.

The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, 615 of those arrested must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling, which applies to people who do not have mandatory detention orders and do not pose a significant threat.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, Fleming told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented individuals – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week, finding her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE is expected to continue operations in Chicago. “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” McLaughlin previously told CNN in a statement following  reports  Bovino planned to leave the city soon. McLaughlin cited a drop in street crime since “Operation Midway Blitz” began.\n \n\n   \n  News that Bovino could leave Chicago came shortly after he was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/20th-strike-us-military-boats-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:58:00-05:00","title":"US military carried out 20th strike on alleged drug boats, killing 4, official says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted its 20th strike on an alleged drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing four individuals, bringing the total deaths from such operations to 80.

Both have pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    The limit does not exist, DOJ argues\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of Thursday’s dispute is whether the 120-day limit imposed for interim US attorneys is truly a limit or a guidance for when the attorney general needs to reassess their selection.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorneys argue that following the limit, an interim appointee must be confirmed by the Senate or have their appointment extended by the judges of the district they serve.\n \n\n   \n  If Halligan can be appointed as the head prosecutor of the Alexandria, Virginia, office despite the limit on individuals serving in the job on an interim basis, McDowell argued, then that guardrail is useless.\n \n\n   \n  Her appointment, he said, acted as an “evasion of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued Thursday that the “government’s reading” of the federal law at issue requires the judge “to add words” to it.\n \n\n   \n  The underlying statute, Whitaker said, doesn’t say the attorney general can only “cram multiple appointments” in one, 120-day period, but instead can continue to select and re-evaluate.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not argue that the attorney general,” Whitaker continued, has a “fire and forget” authority. “The idea that we are going to try to evade Senate confirmation,” is “fanciful.”\n \n\n   \n     US v Trump  \n \n\n   \n  The Judge presiding over the issue of Halligan’s appointment, Cameron McGowan Currie, pressed Whitaker Thursday on whether the government believed the classified documents case in Florida against Donald Trump was incorrectly dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in that case,  Aileen Cannon,  found that then-special counsel Jack Smith was wrongly appointed in part because the Senate had not confirmed him to the role.\n \n\n   \n  The question drew gasps from the audience in the courtroom and came toward the tail end of the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker proceeded to walk a tight legal rope by arguing that Smith would not have even met the qualifications for a US Attorney and enjoyed “unique and broad” powers as a special counsel.\n \n\n   \n  “You wouldn’t have appointed Jack Smith” as a US attorney, Whitaker said, adding that “the attorney general has full authority” to appoint those who qualify.\n \n\n   \n     Missing time  \n \n\n   \n  Currie also laid into Whitaker during the hearing on whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had reviewed the grand jury transcript in James Comey’s case, noting there was no record of anything that happened after 4:28pm ET that day. Comey wasn’t indicted for nearly two hours after that, according to available court transcripts.\n \n\n   \n  “It became obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the entire proceeding, Currie said, adding that it appeared “there was no court reporter present” at the time of the missing portion.\n \n\n   \n  In preparation for Thursday’s hearing, Currie privately reviewed the transcripts and said previously that she thought looking at the transcripts was “necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.”\n \n\n   \n  Currie said she would issue a decision over Halligan’s appointment before Thanksgiving, with both trials currently set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:28:00-05:00","title":"Dow falls by more than 800 points and tech stocks slide as traders dial back expectations for Fed rate cuts","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Thursday, November 13, 2025, U.S. stocks plunged following the end of the longest government shutdown in history.

\n   \n  US stocks were sharply lower Thursday as investors sold shares in technology companies and assessed how long it might take for economic data releases to be rebooted after the  end of the government shutdown. \n \n\n   \n  The Dow was down 832 points, or 1.73%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.79%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.49%.\n \n\n   \n  The House on Wednesday evening approved a funding measure that had been passed by the Senate. The bill was signed by President Donald Trump in the late evening, officially ending the longest US government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  Now Wall Street is focused on the  backlog of government data  that was delayed because of the shutdown — and how it might impact the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Lacking fresh economic data, markets have become increasingly jittery in recent weeks,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note. “Now, as the government shutdown ends, each long-awaited data release or policy announcement will have the potential to move markets dramatically.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Fear and Greed index  moved from “fear” into “extreme fear.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 20% as volatility picked up.\n \n\n   \n  “The gears of the government should be working again soon, and while that is a relief for markets and the economy, there is still plenty of uncertainty, particularly around the missed inflation and jobs data and how these fronts have been faring,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The sell-off in stocks worsened in the afternoon. The third quarter earnings season is winding down, meaning there are fewer fundamental catalysts and markets are more susceptible to moves based on investor sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  Traders on Thursday were pricing in roughly a 47% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 63% chance on Wednesday and a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The data blackout has made the Federal Reserve’s job difficult, but we still expect them to cut interest rates again in December,” Schleif said. “We expect markets to grind higher — though likely with continued volatility.”\n \n\n   \n    Tech woes continue\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors have voiced concerns about relatively expensive valuations and nerves about the foundations of the artificial intelligence boom.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq on Thursday was set for its worst day in a month. Tesla shares ( TSLA ) fell 6.7%. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) fell 6.9%, and Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 4%.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are reevaluating the prices they’re paying for big tech and AI stocks,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong tech rally in recent months, investors have been taking profits and rotating into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq has dropped roughly 5% since closing at a record high on October 29. The tech-heavy index has shed almost $2 trillion in market value across that time period.\n \n\n   \n  Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he recently trimmed some of his exposure to tech.\n \n\n   \n  “It just had such a monstrous run that it just made sense to take the profits and find other opportunities,” Samana said.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow pulled back on Thursday after back-to-back days of record highs. The blue-chip index closed above 48,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors moved into sectors including financials and health care.\n \n\n   \n  Walt Disney shares ( DIS ) fell 8.4% on Thursday after the company reported earnings that did not impress Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, bitcoin fell roughly 3% on Thursday and traded around $98,600. The cryptocurrency has struggled to regain ground since tumbling in recent weeks. Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Fed back in focus\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate cuts in September and October helped provide a tailwind for stocks. Investors could get spooked if central bankers hold rates steady in December due to delayed data and a cloudy view of the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “If sticky inflation forces the Fed to maintain restrictive policy, the cost of capital remains a headwind for valuations,” David Miller, CIO at Catalyst Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/trump-administration-designates-european-antifa-groups-terrorists","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Trump administration designates four European Antifa groups as terrorists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has designated four European Antifa groups — Antifa Ost, FAI/FRI, Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice — as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, placing them in the same category as ISIS-K and al-Shabaab.

romantic companionship — all without much oversight to guarantee the tech is being developed and used safely.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a pair of state attorneys general are teaming up with two of the biggest companies in tech to change that.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, and Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, a Republican, announced on Monday the formation of the AI Task Force. OpenAI and Microsoft have already signed on to the effort, and the attorneys general expect other state regulators and AI companies to join, too. The group will work to develop “basic safeguards” that AI developers should implement to prevent harm to users, especially children, and to identify new risks as the technology develops.\n \n\n   \n  There is no overarching federal law regulating AI, and some federal lawmakers have even sought to restrict regulation of the technology. Jackson and Brown were among the 40 attorneys general who earlier this year successfully  pushed for the removal  of an  AI regulation moratorium  from Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cuts package that could have blocked enforcement of state laws for a decade. (One federal AI law did pass this year: the  Take It Down Act , which specifically cracks down on non-consensual deepfake pornography.)\n \n\n   \n  Concerns about AI safety risks have only escalated in recent months, amid a growing  string of reports  about the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Facebook-parent Meta have also been scrambling to block young people from accessing adult content.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said he’s not hopeful Congress will move quickly to regulate AI.\n \n\n   \n  “They did nothing with respect to social media, nothing with respect for internet privacy, not even for kids, and they came very close to moving in the wrong direction on AI by handcuffing states from doing anything real,” Jackson told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of the task force announcement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the leading AI companies have begun to diverge in their approaches to safety. For example, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  said last month  that the company’s investments in child safety protections would enable it to “treat adults like adults,” including allowing verified adult users to engage in erotic conversations. Shortly after, Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  told CNN  his company would not allow sexual or romantic conversations, even for adults, and that he wanted to make “an AI you trust your kids to use” without a separate, young user experience.\n \n\n   \n  “This effort reflects a shared commitment to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while working collaboratively with stakeholders to understand and mitigate unintended consequences,” Kia Floyd, Microsoft’s general manager of state government affairs, said in a statement on joining the task force. “By partnering with state leaders and industry peers, we can promote innovation and consumer protection to ensure AI serves the public good.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever guardrails the task force develops will technically be voluntary. But the group will have another benefit, too: bringing states’ top law enforcement officers together to track AI developments and risks, potentially making it easier for them to take joint legal action if tech companies harm consumers. That makes this effort different from “a group of think tanks coming together” to create AI safety principles, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson would still like Congress to pass more AI legislation. But, he said, “Congress has left a vacuum and I think it makes sense for AGs to try to fill it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/28/entertainment/holiday-movies-bingo-game","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00-05:00","title":"Give Yourself the Gift of Playing Holiday Movie Bingo","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes 'holiday movie bingo' as a fun, non-controversial activity to help families enjoy Thanksgiving gatherings without getting into heated debates.

\nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Remember that time you had too much   cheese, felt a bit queasy and — as a greasy sheen broke out on your forehead — you lied to yourself that it was salad from now on?\n \n\n   \n  Then spare a thought for the heroic judges at this year’s World Cheese Awards, who assembled on Thursday to anoint an aged Swiss Gruyère as the best cheese in the world for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This army of 265 cheese experts from all over the planet was tasked with wading through dairy concoctions of every shape, size, color and consistency in a large auditorium in the Swiss capital Bern. In the space of a couple of hours, each judge plowed their way through at least 40 cheeses — sniffing, stroking, crumbling, and finally, tasting to arrive at a score.\n \n\n   \n  The winner was Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen, a cheese made from cow’s milk at a small dairy in the Alpine lowlands of western Switzerland. “It’s an incredible honor,” said cheesemaker Pius Hitz, shortly after picking up the top prize.\n \n\n   \n  While the win in previous years has resulted in a surge in sales for the champion cheese, Hitz said his herd of red and white Fleckvieh   cows can rest easy. A production increase is unlikely, he said, so as not to disturb the delicate balance of the protected Gruyère market.\n \n\n   \n  Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen may have only traveled a few miles to the awards, but it was still a long journey to the top. More so for its rivals, many of which had to navigate long plane rides, tricky import legislation and the US shutdown even before the contest started.\n \n\n   \n  No fewer than 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries made it to Bern’s Festhalle venue where, as judgment day wore on, they made their presence known with cascades of intensifying odors that collided with sound waves from an ensemble of Swiss horns tooting in the corner of the auditorium.\n \n\n   \n    Soft pools of goo\n \n\n   \n  The cheeses were divided up across 110 rows of white-clothed tables under the scrutiny of two- or three-person judging teams. All wearing matching yellow aprons, they were drawn from the community of makers, mongers and mavens who make up the ranks of the international cheese cognoscenti.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 10 a.m., they began the Herculean labor of trying to find bronze, silver, gold and “super gold” contenders among the milk-based marvels — stripped of identifying features so they can be blind tasted — stretching before them.\n \n\n   \n  Holes were bored in giant waxy wheels, slivers shaved from wedges, spoons dipped into soft pools of goo. In between tastings, palates were cleansed with sips of water, bites of crunchy apples and, in some cases, emergency swigs of Coca-Cola.\n \n\n   \n  There were cow, sheep, buffalo, camel and donkey milk   cheeses. Manchegos, Bries, Camemberts, cheddars, Parmesans, Goudas. Orange cheeses, blue cheeses, green cheeses. Cheeses covered in wax. Cheeses covered in flowers. At least one cheese doused in whiskey and red apple juice.\n \n\n   \n  Some were hard. Some crumbly. Some dense. Some were light and fluffy. Some were so soft they needed to be in jars. Some, their tops cut off to reveal a moist interior glistening with mold, looked as if they might teem with lifeforms as yet unknown to science.\n \n\n   \n  All were awarded points based on appearance, smell, taste, texture and the feeling it gives in the mouth — not always a pleasant experience, apparently.\n \n\n   \n  “There were a couple of no-swallows today,” said Emma Young, a UK cheesemonger and author judging the wares laid out on table 26, pointing out a cheese that she thought might have encountered problems during the making process.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t all bad.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s bonkers,” Young added. “I’ve tasted some of the best cheeses I’ve had in my life — and some of the worst. It’s been so much of a palate workout.” She pointed to a cheese that earned top marks thanks to a “complexity” she put down to the varieties of milk used.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Biting into a cloud’\n \n\n   \n  “If only it tasted as beautiful as it looks,” said Ashley Morton, a judge on table 11, where an unusually bright blue cheese, made using spirulina algae, was attracting camera phones. Morton, a “cheese ambassador” originally from New York who goes by the nickname Brieyoncé, favored a raw goat cheese coated in a gray substance that was “almost like biting into a cloud.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look at the fruit level here,” said Jen Shelton, an organic milk expert originally from Kansas, discussing a large wheel of cheese covered in pressed grapes with fellow table-52 judge Charles Beauquesne, from France. The cheese then scattered onto the table. “It’s very crumbly,” she added. “Milky, but quite dry. The grapes give it a little bit of sweetness, but it’s claggy.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair made a note of the cheese’s score, wiped down their utensils with a paper towel   and moved on to the next candidate.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, many of the judges had made their final selection, carrying “super gold” winners to a separate judging area where a team of seasoned cheese experts pared the field down to 14 finalists. These were then tasted and scored live on stage, like an aromatic “Dancing with the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  The shortlist included a Japanese soft goat’s cheese with a texture like whipped cream, a UK hard cheese the color of a deep sunset, one US cheese and, inevitably, several more Swiss cheeses. It’s widely recognized that entries from the host country have a home advantage — cheeses are not great travelers — but locals don’t always take the crown. A Gruyère won in 2022 when the contest was staged in Wales.\n \n\n   \n  John Farrand, managing director of the event’s organizers, the UK-based Guild of Fine Food, said the World Cheese Awards stand out above other dairy contests around the planet because it can claim to be truly global — staged in different countries and involving such a diverse cast of entrants and judges. In 2026, the contest will move to Córdoba in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  The winning cheese of 2025 was championed by Perry Wakeman, one of the top-level judges who normally is found aging cheese at Rennet & Rind, near Cambridge, England. The Gruyère was a worthy winner, he said, describing its complexity: “Butterscotch, caramel. Savory, some fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal. The length was unbelievable. Three cheeses on, we could still taste it.”\n \n\n   \n  For onlookers, the cheese judging could be a frustrating process. Concerns over foot and mouth disease and other agricultural health problems meant that only judges who’d signed a waiver were permitted to sample the produce under the terms of the contest’s special import license.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the day, the auditorium tables were still groaning with leftover cheese that would sadly never be eaten. The contest organizers said that the remnants don’t completely go to waste, but would be recycled locally and “turned into energy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/fetterman-hospitalized-fall","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:28:00-05:00","title":"Pennsylvania Sen.

Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), bolstered by Russian weapons like Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 tanks, and anti-aircraft systems, are portrayed as politically aligned and well-known in the region, but critically weakened by over a decade of economic collapse, lack of maintenance, and a massive exodus of young, potential military personnel.

    3:24 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The build-up of US naval forces in the Caribbean, boosted by the recent arrival near Latin America of the  USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier , has raised speculation that both the US and Venezuela may be  preparing for a larger conflict. \n \n\n   \n  While the US has characterized the build-up as aimed at combating drug trafficking, some experts have questioned why so much firepower is needed if the sole aim is targeting drug boats – noting that the ship’s arrival marks the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself – described as the US Navy’s “ most lethal combat platform ” – the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the region alongside more than a dozen warships – including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship, and amphibious assault vessels – and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  That sort of firepower brings into sharp relief what experts characterize as the aging Soviet-era equipment Venezuela would be relying on if US President Donald Trump  were to decide  on military action inside the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the forces at Caracas’ disposal:\n \n\n   \n    A tough, but aging, Soviet image\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), has built a reputation over the past two decades as a regional military power a cut above most of its neighbors in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that image was forged through the sustained acquisition of Russian equipment under Maduro’s predecessor the late President Hugo Chávez, a former professional soldier who owed his ascent to power to the revolutionary movement he founded within the Armed Forces.\n \n\n   \n  After Chávez became president in 1999 (seven years after he organized a failed military coup), he funneled the country’s massive oil resources into the Armed Forces, buying Russian equipment due to an informal US embargo, and placing military men into key government positions. \n \n\n   \n  As a result of this, weapons systems such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 battle tanks, S-300, Pechora and Buk anti-aircraft missiles, portable Igla-S systems, and Kalashnikov rifles – all designed in Soviet times, have come to define the FANB’s image, distinguishing it from other militaries in the region, which tend to rely more heavily on US or European weaponry (though Venezuela still has some ageing US-designed equipment from pre-Chávez days).\n \n\n   \n    A paper tiger?\n \n\n   \n  The problem for Venezuela is that while on paper it has a relatively well-equipped military, question marks hang over the maintenance of its equipment and the training of its personnel – not least because the country has suffered more than a decade of economic hardship, one of the world’s  highest rates of inflation  and a drop in oil production, all made worse by US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Partly due to this economic collapse, about 7.9 million Venezuelans – many of them young people of military service age – have left the country, according to UNHCR data.\n \n\n   \n  Though the government “recently resumed modest maintenance and modernization efforts,” according to a 2024 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), these years of underinvestment have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  “The FANB has a rather low level of operational capability and asset availability, partly because they’ve been through more than a decade of economic crisis in the country,” Andrei Serbin Pont, an analyst specializing in defense at the CRIES think tank told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Military and militia: In numbers\n \n\n   \n  Currently, the FANB has about 123,000 active personnel – Army (63,000), Navy (25,500), Air Force (11,500), and National Guard (23,000), according to the IISS. These are supplemented by a further 8,000 reservists.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to its regular military units, Venezuela can call on the Bolivarian Militia – a reserve force made up of civilians created by Chávez and named after Simon Bolivar, the revolutionary who secured the independence of numerous Latin American countries from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  However, the true size of the militia is opaque. Prior to the recent US build-up, the IISS estimated its number at 220,000, but in August Maduro claimed he would deploy 4.5 million militiamen in response. Weeks later he said he expected to call up a total of 8.2 million – though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of their training.\n \n\n   \n    Army: Loyal, but top heavy?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower:  With its 63,000 members, Venezuela’s ground forces account for the greatest chunk of its active personnel. They also have the longest history and are most politically aligned with the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Chávez, both the current interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, passed through the army – and Padrino is still an active general-in-chief.\n \n\n   \n  One indicator of how entwined the government and army have become is the unusual number of generals and admirals, with promotions being doled out for political loyalty. In 2019, that number was estimated at about 2,000 by Admiral Craig Faller, then chief of the US Southern Command, in a speech to the US Congress. “More than in all of NATO,” he pointed out. (In comparison, in 2025, the US had  about 850  for an Armed Forces 10 times larger).\n \n\n   \n  “Ecuador is a convent, Colombia is a university, and Venezuela is a barracks,” goes an old saying, attributed to Bolívar, that sums up the relationship of Venezuelans with the army.\n \n\n   \n   Weaponry:  Notable systems bought from Russia in recent years include 92 T-72B1 tanks – similar to those being used in Ukraine – and 123 BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, which equip the armored brigades alongside 81 AMX-30 tanks previously acquired from France, according to the IISS. Artillery systems include the Russian Msta-S self-propelled howitzer and Smerch rocket launchers.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿Led by:  The Operational Strategic Commander of all of Venezuela’s armed forces is Domingo Antonio Hernández Lárez. His brother, Major General Johan Alexander Hernández Lárez, is in charge of the army.\n \n\n   \n    Air Force: High standard\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  With 11,500 members, the Bolivarian Military Aviation, or Air Force, is the smallest of the country’s forces but takes pride of place due to the acquisition of Russian equipment that has set it apart among regional competitors in the Caribbean and most of Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  At the center of these are the Sukhoi Su-30MK2s, high-performance twin-engine fighters that, even though developed in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, are unmatched in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-September, the FANB  shared videos  of two of its Su-30s armed with Kh-31 anti-ship missiles, also Russian-made, in a show of what remains their most advanced weapons system.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is thought to have had 24 of these at one point, but at least three have crashed, according to the IISS. The Venezuelan NGO Control Ciudadano says the accidents highlight “problems of system obsolescence and of maintenance and lack of spare parts.”\n \n\n   \n  The Su-30s coexist with a few old US F-16 fighters that Venezuela bought before Chávez came to power.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela also has Russian built air defenses that include 12 batteries of long-range S-300 missiles; 9 Buk systems and 44 Pechora, both medium-range; and numerous portable Igla-S launchers, according to the IISS.\n \n\n   \n  These defenses, while advanced, would likely be the first targets of an opponent if a conflict were to break out, said Serbin Pont, the CRIES analyst.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Major General Lenín Lorenzo Ramírez Villasmil.\n \n\n   \n    Navy: Weak point?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  The Bolivarian Navy, whose 25,500 members are tasked primarily with operations in the Caribbean, has lagged the other services in terms of arms purchases in recent decades.\n \n\n   \n  It currently operates only one Mariscal Sucre-class frigate (manufactured in Italy) and one Type-209 submarine (manufactured in Germany) in its sea fleet, according to the IISS. It also has nine oceanic and coastal patrol vessels, including four purchased from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  “The Navy lost many of its assets that it had prior to (Chavez), and these were not fully replaced. The corvettes bought from Spain were never equipped with weaponry, until a few years ago when Chilean and Iranian anti-ship missiles were installed, but they do not have viable anti-aircraft defense systems,” said Serbin Pont.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Admiral Ashraf Suleimán Gutiérrez.\n \n\n   \n    And the militias?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Maduro has repeatedly played up the role of the Bolivarian Militia, formed in 2008 by Chavez to provide a loyal paramilitary force that, while technically part of the Armed Forces, comes directly under the control of the president.\n \n\n   \n  As an umbrella term for various groups that range widely in experience and ability, a definitive account of how many people belong to the Bolivarian Militia is hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  Days after news of the US naval deployment broke, Maduro said in August he was going to “activate … more than 4.5 million militiamen” taken from “all the factories and workplaces of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Missiles and rifles for the working class, so that they may defend our homeland,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He later suggested there were more than 8 million militia members.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the discrepancies in number, Serbin Pont said that while there were some traditional militias composed of reservists with military experience, most of the groups showcased by the government on television and social media were too inexperienced to play a decisive fighting role.\n \n\n   \n  “Those people do not have sufficient training. There is no real armed structure to mobilize those elements, and those elements would not be effective in combat,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Their real use, Serbin Pont suggested, was serving “as an intelligence network and a repressive threat against the civilian population precisely because they are based on a network that penetrates the whole of society.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:35:00-13:00","title":"Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 80","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military, under the Trump administration, conducted 21 strikes between September 2 and November 10, 2025, resulting in 80 deaths and the destruction of 21 boats.

The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n    November 6\n \n\n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, killing three people, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters,” Hegseth said in a  post on X , adding that US forces were not harmed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n    November 9\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific according, to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n    November 10\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon conducted  its 20th strike   on an alleged drug trafficking boat on November 10, a Defense Department official said on November 13.\n \n\n   \n  “The strike occurred in the Caribbean and four narco-terrorists were killed, no survivors,” the official confirmed in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/uk/sami-hamdi-uk-us-ice-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:33:00-05:00","title":"British Journalist Sami Hamdi Returns to London After More Than Two Weeks in ICE Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British journalist Sami Hamdi, a political commentator and human rights defender, was detained for over two weeks by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza.

British journalist Sami Hamdi returns to London after more than two weeks in ICE detention \n       \n  By Kara Fox, Sana Noor Haq, Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:33 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A British journalist detained by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained Sami Hamdi, a London-based commentator and father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport, one day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analyses on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV. He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi told reporters outside a hotel in the British capital on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement before his return to London, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions in ICE detention, where he said he was held in a small room with dozens of men and forced to wait more than eight hours for medical care. Hamdi also said he was kept in shackles despite never being charged with a crime.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory,” in remarks from a speech that he said were taken out of context. However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” Hamdi told reporters Thursday after arriving in London. “Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he said alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi’s family said in a statement Thursday that “no family should ever have to go through what we have.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the last 18 days, (Hamdi) has been detained in a room with 80–90 other people, living in terrible conditions. All this because Sami, a journalist, political commentator, and human rights defender, spoke out against Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   \n  Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  “They locked a journalist in an ICE cell and tried to frighten the public with baseless claims, and, in the end, all they proved was their own abuse of power.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/europe/cardias-miracles-fraud-charge-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:18:00-05:00","title":"Self-styled miracle worker whose followers claimed could multiply gnocchi charged with fraud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gisella Cardia and her husband Gianni Cardia, a self-styled clairvoyant couple from Rome, have been charged with fraud after years of drawing large numbers of Catholic pilgrims to a field shrine dedicated to the Madonna of Trevignano, where they claimed the statue wept blood and multiplied food such as gnocchi and pizza.

The statue was said to weep blood and transmit messages Gisella Cardia claimed were both from God and Satan, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who have been denounced by the Vatican, created a shrine to the Madonna statuette and regularly held prayer events, during which Gisella Cardia would take to the stage and preach.\n \n\n   \n  Her followers have told media that, although Gisella Cardia did not multiply bread and loaves, she would often show up with one box of pizza or a plate of gnocchi that somehow multiplied to feed the masses.\n \n\n   \n  The couple also collected nearly €400,000 ($465,000) between 2018 and 2024 from those who came to pray in front of the statue, promising that the money would go to children’s hospital, the prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia, which has charged them with fraud, confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor’s office has alleged that the money was used to spruce up the pilgrimage site and for a $40,000 car, and was not taxed in accordance with religious donations.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who will face trial in April, are accused of staging “apparitions” to make it seem that blood was flowing from the Madonna statue’s eyes for money.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged scam came to light in 2023 after a former follower contacted police. In an interview with state broadcaster RAI, he said he told officers that he’d found a coffin in his car following an alleged confrontation with Gisella Cardia.\n \n\n   \n  Police launched an investigation, testing the blood which turned out to match Gisella Cardia’s DNA, geneticist Emiliano Giardina of the public prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia said in a court report.\n \n\n   \n  At that time,  the Vatican  released a statement warning pilgrims to be wary of “the alleged apparitions and revelations reported by Mrs. Gisella Cardia… and by Mr. Gianni Cardia,” which it said had been judged to be  not supernatural .\n \n\n   \n  The couple’s lawyer Solange Marchignoli told CNN Thursday: “(Gisella) Cardia is relieved, as she believes this moment represents an opportunity to transparently reveal the truth of the facts and to definitively put an end to all forms of speculation, misunderstanding, and controversy that have, despite herself, involved her in recent months.” Marchignoli added that the couple “welcomed the trial and said it would be a necessary step to finally clarify, in the appropriate venues, every aspect of the case involving her.”\n \n\n   \n  One woman told a local news channel in an interview later broadcast by RAI that she witnessed Gisella Cardia multiplying pizza.\n \n\n   \n  “We were at her house for a rosary, and there were about 20 or 25 of us. After the rosary, we decided to stay there for a while to talk. At one point, someone brought a box of pizza. A person near us cut it and each of us went over there and took a little piece at a time… We all ate it. The pizza was never ending and this is all the work of Divine Providence through Gisella,” the woman said.\n \n\n   \n  Gisella Cardia herself also recounted a similar instance in an interview with La Repubblica newspaper when allegations of into fraud first surfaced in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “There was lunch left over, consisting of gnocchi and a bit of rabbit,” she said. “Everyone ate the gnocchi and rabbit, 15 people, and it’s incredible. While I was dishing out the gnocchi, the food didn’t get any smaller, nor did the pot.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/toy-story-5-teaser-watch-now","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-05:00","title":"Screens are the enemy in new ‘Toy Story 5’ teaser trailer","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'Toy Story 5' presents a poignant reflection on the declining role of physical toys in modern childhood, as it introduces a new digital device, Lilypad, that beckons Bonnie Anderson to engage with screens.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sean “Diddy” Combs will be staying in prison at least one month longer than he thought.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Prisons pushed Combs’ release date to June 4, 2028, according to the agency’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ original release date – first reported in October, more than three months after a jury delivered a mixed verdict in his federal trial – had been scheduled for May 8, 2028.\n \n\n   \n  No explanation was given by the Bureau of Prisons for the pushed back date  and representatives couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The change could reflect an updated calculation or punishment if an infraction, if any, occurred.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ spokesman Juda Engelmayer told CNN they have not been given an explanation for the changed date yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still trying to find out what the dates mean and why and what the issue is, if there is one” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs was accepted into the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program, known as RDAP, at the low security prison in Fort Dix, NJ. Inmates who participate in the program often receive credits that can reduce time from their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “His only goal is he wants to work on himself, do better, be better, and get back to his family and be the father that they need. He’s not going to do anything to hurt that,” Engelmayer said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs had been sentenced to 50 months (roughly more than four years) by a judge after a two-month trial ended with him being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs was acquitted by a jury of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering for which he was facing decades and possibly life in prison if convicted.\n \n\n   \n  He has already served 13 months in jail and that will be credited to his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  He had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest. In late  October , Combs was transferred on Thursday to  Fort Dix , a low-security federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is appealing his conviction and sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ defense previously told CNN that they had approached President Donald Trump’s administration about a potential pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ attorney Nicole Westmoreland  told CNN  in August that it was her “understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon.” At the time, a White House official told CNN they “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any clemency request.”\n \n\n   \n  In October after Combs’ sentencing, Trump confirmed that Combs had requested a presidential pardon in connection with his federal criminal case,  telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins  “a lot of people have asked me for pardons,” including Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously indicated that he was unlikely to pardon Combs during an  interview  with Newsmax, saying, “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.” Trump said that this made pardoning Combs “more difficult to do.”\n \n\n   \n  During his trial, Combs’ defense admitted to his pattern of violent behavior against women with whom he was in romantic relationships over the years. The jury was repeatedly shown footage — first published in 2024 by CNN — of Combs violently beating his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016. The jury was also shown images of bloody gashes and bruises on Ventura’s body during trial.\n \n\n   \n  Ventura was the star witness of the case and testified that she was repeatedly abused by Combs and forced to take drugs and have sex with other men against her will throughout their 10-year relationship, during which he controlled her career and finances. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” also recounted psychological, financial and physical abuse by Combs who she said forced her to have sex with other men while she was under the influence of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  At his sentencing, judge Arun Submaranian  admonished Combs  for his abuse and rejected the defense’s “attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate consensual experiences or just a sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll story.” Submaranian said that the prosecution’s case “showed that (Combs) abused the power and control (he) had over the women (he) professed to love dearly.”\n \n\n   \n  “You abused them physically, emotionally and psychologically and you used that abuse to get your way,” he said, addressing Combs. “This was subjugation, and it drove both Ms. Ventura and Jane to thoughts of ending their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs is also facing roughly 70 civil lawsuits where most of the dozens of accusers — some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged incidents — claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs has denied all of the civil claims. Some of the lawsuits have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.

Kevin Stitt has spared the life of a death row inmate just before he was set to receive a lethal injection on Thursday, commuting the man’s sentence to life in prison without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt formally granted clemency to Tremane Wood, 46, who was scheduled to die for the stabbing death of a man during a botched robbery in 2002. It is just the second time the Republican governor has granted clemency during his nearly seven years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation to commute Tremane Wood’s sentence to life without parole,” Stitt announced.\n \n\n   \n  “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” the governor said.\n \n\n   \n  In his executive order commuting Wood’s sentence, Stitt says Wood shall not be eligible to apply for or be considered for a commutation, pardon or parole for the rest of his life.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt previously granted clemency to  death row inmate Julius Jones  in 2021, but had rejected clemency recommendations in four other cases. A total of 16 men have been executed during Stitt’s time in office.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment with the governor’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I am disappointed that the governor has granted clemency for this dangerous murderer, but respect that this was his decision to make,” Drummond said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Wood was scheduled to die for his role in the killing of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farmworker from Montana, during an attempted robbery at a north Oklahoma City hotel early on New Year’s Day in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves, said she and her legal team are “profoundly grateful” for Stitt’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace,” her statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Wipf grew up in a Hutterite religious community in Montana, and his family and the surviving victim of the attack supported his clemency, Castro Alves said.\n \n\n   \n  George Burnett, one of the original prosecutors, said he’s concerned that a five-member parole board can have such a profound impact on a case that has been litigated for more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “Ronnie Wipf is buried on a lonely hill somewhere on the plains of Montana, and when his family visits him, they wonder what might have been,” Burnett said.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma’s Pardon and Parole Board  voted 3-2 last week  to recommend that the governor grant clemency.\n \n\n   \n  During the clemency hearing, Wood’s attorneys didn’t deny that he participated in the robbery but maintained that his brother, Zjaiton Wood, was the one who actually stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood was sentenced to life without parole. Before he died in prison in 2019, he admitted to several people that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.\n \n\n   \n  Castro Alves told the panel Tremane Wood had an ineffective trial attorney who was drinking heavily at the time and who did little work on the case. She also said trial prosecutors improperly concealed from jurors the benefits that witnesses received in exchange for their testimony. Wood’s attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution on these grounds, but were denied.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while in prison, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering attacks on other inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Wood, who testified to the panel via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but denied being the one who killed Wipf.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a monster. I’m not a killer. I never was and I never have been,” Wood said.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorneys also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution, but the court denied that request early Thursday. His attorneys had argued, among other things, that trial prosecutors didn’t properly reveal details of a plea agreement with a key witness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/401k-ira-contribution-limits-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"401(k), IRA contribution limits get a bump up","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The IRS has announced cost-of-living adjustments to retirement savings limits for 2026, increasing the 401(k) and 403(b) contribution limits to $24,500, and raising the catch-up contribution limits for those aged 50 and over to $8,000 (totaling $32,500), with even higher limits for those aged 60–63.

bump up \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:20 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you plan to max out your contributions to your 401(k) or IRA next year, you will get to save a little more than you could this year.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS on Thursday announced cost-of-living adjustments to federal contribution limits for 2026 for key retirement savings vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  401(k) participants will be allowed to   put away up to $24,500 next year, a $1,000 increase from the current limit. The same increase will apply to 403(b)s, governmental 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone 50 or older in those plans can save more. Next year the so-called “catch-up contribution” limit rises to $8,000 from $7,500, for a total of $32,500. But those who are ages 60, 61, 62, and 63 may save even more – up to an additional $11,250, which is the same limit as this year, for a total of $35,750.\n \n\n   \n  There is another change, however, for the highest-earning older savers. Starting in 2026, if in the prior year you made more than $145,000 in FICA wages — that is income subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes — any catch-up contributions you make will  automatically be subject to income tax . So they essentially will be treated as  Roth 401(k)  contributions.\n \n\n   \n    New savings and income limits for traditional and Roth IRAs\n \n\n   \n  If you are eligible to put money into a tax-deductible IRA or an after- tax Roth IRA, you will be allowed to save up to $7,500, which is $500 more than you can sock away this year.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit if you’re at least 50 will be $1,100, up from $1,000 today.\n \n\n   \n  The income thresholds to determine whether you’re eligible to save in those IRA vehicles are also being adjusted.\n \n\n   \n  Those thresholds differ based both on your marital status and whether or not you’re covered by a retirement savings plan at work. (Here are the IRS’ new  income threshold breakdowns  across those categories.)\n \n\n   \n    Limits for Saver’s Credit and SIMPLE Accounts also change\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a low- or moderate-income worker, you may be eligible for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, also known as the  Saver’s Credit . It’s essentially a government-provided match on at least a portion of your retirement contributions to an IRA or workplace retirement plan. The credit, which won’t change next year, is worth up to $1,000 for single filers; and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n \n\n   \n  To qualify in 2026, your income may not exceed $40,250 if you’re a single filer or married filing separately, which is up $750 from this year’s income limit. If you file as head of household, your income may not be more than $60,375, up $1,125 compared to this year. And it may not top $80,500 if you’re married filing jointly, up $1,500.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re employed by a small business offering a  SIMPLE IRA  at work and put retirement savings into a SIMPLE account, you may save up to $17,000 next year, up from $16,500 today; although for some types of SIMPLE accounts the contribution limit rises to $18,100, up from $17,600.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit will be increased to $4,000 from $3,500 currently. Savers who are between the ages of 60 and 63 may contribute an additional $5,250, which is the same as this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:59:00-05:00","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown continues to severely impact air travel, with over 11,000 flights canceled since the FAA issued an emergency order on Tuesday to reduce flights by 6% at 40 of the busiest U.S. airports.

Ukraine’s ability to withstand the  Russian campaign , and carefully ration its power supplies, served only to cement its leader Volodymyr Zelensky’s credibility at home.\n \n\n   \n  Three years on, the picture is rather more difficult. Ukraine’s president finds himself under fire over a burgeoning energy sector corruption scandal, while his people face a fourth tough winter, with power cuts and heating outages as severe as ever.\n \n\n   \n  On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces find themselves losing ground across the east, most critically in the one-time  logistics hub of Pokrovsk , as key Western allies appear to be focused elsewhere. The war may still be Ukraine’s overriding priority, but corruption is likely Zelensky’s most immediate concern.\n \n\n   \n  The scandal, which centers on alleged kickbacks from contractors including those working to protect critical energy infrastructure, has already taken down two of Zelensky’s ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the government announced it was suspending German Galushchenko, the justice minister, who previously served as energy minister. Galushchenko said he would defend himself in the face of the allegations. Both he and his successor as energy minister have since submitted their resignations at Zelensky’s urging; swift parliamentary approval is expected.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Ukraine’s anti-corruption body announced it had carried out searches on dozens of properties – including one linked to Galushchenko – as part of an investigation into the alleged kickbacks.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said about $100 million had been siphoned off – between 10-15% of the value of the contracts – as state-owned businesses including Energoatom, which operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, paid companies for work done to enhance security at key sites.\n \n\n   \n  That the latest corruption scandal involves the energy sector gives it a particular edge. People in Kyiv are currently without electricity for eight to 11 hours per day, a result of Russia’s improved ability to strike  power plants and substations .\n \n\n   \n  Diesel generators, purchased during the first blackouts three years ago, have reappeared outside shops and cafes. Candlelit dinners have again become part of the daily routine.\n \n\n   \n  The blackouts can also mean heating is off, lifts in high-rise buildings do not work, and water supply is interrupted. The situation is usually worse in towns and cities outside the capital.\n \n\n   \n     Zelensky name-checked in court \n \n\n   \n  Court hearings on the investigation – live streamed on the public broadcaster’s website – have been underway in Kyiv since Tuesday and look set to continue for at least the next few days. They include snippets of what investigators say are 1,000 hours of recorded conversations between the suspects in the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a potentially damaging first, one of the conversations released Wednesday name-checked Zelensky himself. In a transcript read out in court, the man accused of masterminding the corruption scheme, Timur Mindich, appeared to suggest he had influence over the president, boasting to Galushchenko of his success in getting Zelensky to call the then-energy minister on the phone and invite him for a meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript contained no details of that alleged call, and Zelensky has made no comment. It is believed to be the first time his name has been mentioned, albeit indirectly, in a corruption case in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is Mindich himself, perhaps the most awkward element in all this as far as Ukraine’s leader is concerned.\n \n\n   \n  Given the codename Carlson by his alleged co-conspirators, Mindich is a former business partner of Zelensky, dating back to his previous career as a highly successful entertainer and producer.\n \n\n   \n  Mindich himself has made no comment on the accusations against him and has left the country, Ukraine’s state border agency said in a statement late Wednesday. The agency noted he had left legally, adding they had not received an order to stop him. Zelensky’s cabinet has now introduced sanctions on Mindich, which include a block on his business interests and bank accounts.\n \n\n   \n     Defeating Russia and tackling corruption \n \n\n   \n  Corruption allegations are nothing new in Ukraine. During the first months of Moscow’s full scale invasion, there was an unwritten understanding among Ukraine’s journalists and civil society that corruption investigations were not a priority. Defeating Russia was the only thing that mattered.\n \n\n   \n  That consensus began to decay after about a year. Since 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) has opened investigations into a series of scandals, including an illegal land development project involving a deputy prime minister and the embezzlement of public funds allocated to pay for soldiers’ food.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Zelensky has managed to avoid getting dragged into the scandals, though Ukrainians put him on notice in the summer with large anti-government protests – the biggest since the full scale invasion – after he approved a parliamentary move to neuter NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office. He backed down under pressure from key international allies, who have made anti-corruption an important plank of their long-term support for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister under Zelensky and now head of the Kyiv School of Economics, told CNN the president had to “act as harshly as possible” if he wanted to maintain popular support among Ukrainians. “(People) say, ‘Let’s see how he acts… if he’s not acting, then he’s with them (the accused). We’ll know if he’s acting… but if he really sanctions them, arrests them, prosecutes those who allow this to happen, then, okay, he’s good.’”\n \n\n   \n  Until Tuesday, Mylovanov was a member of the supervisory board of Energoatom, before resigning his position over what he said was the failure of company executives to act rapidly on the scandal, though he blamed the foot-dragging on cluelessness rather than corruption.\n \n\n   \n  It is too soon to assess whether this corruption scandal will cause any lasting  damage to Zelensky’s support among Ukrainians. Recent polling conducted by  the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, albeit before the latest allegations, shows popular levels of trust in the Ukrainian leader remaining at around 60% – down on the figures for earlier this year, but consistent with the levels enjoyed in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Tolerance of corruption has declined over the same period, though not dramatically.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hunder, who leads the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said it was essential that those who were stealing from the state were held fully accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a critical moment for Ukraine’s leadership to show that its commitment to integrity and accountability is unwavering,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mylovanov took a more pessimistic view of how the corruption scandal would likely play with the Trump administration, regardless of how Zelensky acts.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if they care or not,” he said. “But they will use it as a leverage point over Zelensky.”\n \n\n   \n   Victoria Butenko and Svitlana Vlasova contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:55:00-05:00","title":"Border Patrol Headed to Charlotte, North Carolina?

We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations or been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in ICE operations and would only get involved when there are criminal behavior or warrants under its jurisdiction, Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat,  said  in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Rumors are already flying in Charlotte, and even though there’s no official confirmation of Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year has created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials are in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump Administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young, Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitment to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild and Celina Tebor contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/health/pig-kidney-transplant-studies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00.000Z","title":"Doctors say they’re ‘measurably closer’ to making pig kidneys work for humans","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doctors at NYU Langone Health have made significant progress in xenotransplantation by successfully implanting genetically modified pig kidneys into human recipients.

making pig kidneys work for humans \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doctors at NYU Langone Health say two new studies show that they are a significant step closer to making kidney transplants from other species a real option in the near future.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have been searching for years for an alternative to human transplants because the donor supply cannot keep up with demand, particularly where kidneys are concerned.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90,000 people in the US are waiting for a kidney transplant, and about 11 of them die every day,  according to UNOS , the nonprofit that manages the nation’s organ donation system. But with an aging population and the rise in conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, the need will only grow.\n \n\n   \n  Dialysis can keep a person with end-stage kidney disease alive, but the process can be hard on the body and  can typically  sustain someone for only about five years, on average.\n \n\n   \n  In the search for an alternative, scientists have been turning to cross-species organ transplants, called xenotransplantation.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest hurdles they have to overcome is the body’s tendency to reject an organ transplant. New studies published Thursday in the journal Nature offer more information on how to prevent the body from rejecting the pig kidney, and the researchers say they think they’ve had a breakthrough in understanding how the immune system handles these kinds of transplants.\n \n\n   \n    The rejection issue\n \n\n   \n  The human immune system protects the body from threats like fungus or bacteria, but it can sometimes be a little overprotective.\n \n\n   \n  The immune system cannot distinguish between a bad foreign object that enters the body, like a virus, and a good one, like a donor organ. When either is introduced, the immune system goes into full protection mode, sending antibodies to attack whatever it identifies as the problem. Those antibodies can damage the donor organ and ultimately make a transplant fail.\n \n\n   \n  Even with human-to-human transplants, rejection is a big concern. For the rest of their lives, recipients must take powerful anti-rejection drugs that suppress the immune system. When the donor is a pig, scientists also genetically alter the organ to make it more compatible with the human body.\n \n\n   \n  The new studies aimed to take the closest look possible at how the human body rejects a pig organ.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at NYU transplanted an organ from a genetically modified pig into a person who was brain-dead: Maurice Miller, 57, who died from a mass in his brain in July 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors said Miller had always wanted to donate his organs but could not do so because he had cancer. Instead, they asked Miller’s family if they would donate his entire body to research.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers thought an organ transplant into a brain-dead person would allow them to test tissue samples and blood in ways that would be too intrusive with a living recipient or even with a non-human primate, said study co-author Dr. Robert Montgomery, chief of the New York University Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “This decedent might be the most highly studied human in history,” Montgomery said of Miller.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors removed Miller’s own kidneys and transplanted a genetically modified kidney from a specially bred pig from the biotech company Revivicor. Miller’s body was kept alive on a ventilator in the ICU for two months. During that time, doctors biopsied the kidney regularly, monitored his blood and tested other tissue samples.\n \n\n   \n  There were two episodes in which Miller’s body tried to reject the pig kidney, but for the first time in history of xenotransplantation, Montgomery said, they had success with   available rejection medication, and the organ continued to function. They stopped the experiment at day 61.\n \n\n   \n  This part of the work, Montgomery explained, would help doctors better understand what immunosuppressive medications would work best in other people who receive pig organs.\n \n\n   \n  “It also will give us a sense of relief moving forward in the clinical trials that we’re in the middle of right now, to know that when you put a pig kidney in a human, from a physiological standpoint, it just does its thing,” Montgomery said. “The kidney is capable of doing most of the things that a human kidney can do, and the things that it doesn’t, we either have redundancy and we don’t necessarily need it, or there’s a few drugs that we need to supplement. But other than that, we’re good to go.”\n \n\n   \n  The new research, he said, “brings us measurably closer to safe pig-to-human organ transplants.”\n \n\n   \n    Creating a detailed map\n \n\n   \n  During the episodes in which Miller’s body started to reject the organ, the doctors were able to create a detailed map of exactly how his immune system reacted to the pig organ and identify the pathways the body was using to reject it. They also were able to map out the genomics associated with those pathways, mapping 5,100 expressed pig and human genes and pinpointing every immune cell in the body to track immune behavior at this uniquely granular level.\n \n\n   \n  “We really were able to tease apart what happened on a nearly daily basis,” said study co-author Dr Brendan Keating, a member of the faculty in the Department of Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  They could also see   the differences in immune reaction to a pig organ versus what happens with a transplanted human organ.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers said they identified biomarkers in the blood that eventually may be used to detect organ rejection much earlier, before damage could be done.\n \n\n   \n  Although the study is a major step forward, Montgomery said, it involved just one person, so the findings will need to be replicated in others to see whether the reactions are consistent. The researchers just got funding to test immune suppression techniques in 20 additional patients, he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We’re getting better at this’\n \n\n   \n  In the past year alone, scientist have made enormous progress in understanding how pig kidney transplants work.\n \n\n   \n  The most notable success involved the case of Tim Andrews of New Hampshire, the fourth living person in the US to get a kidney from a genetically modified pig.\n \n\n   \n  Andrews set a record when his pig kidney continued to function ﻿for 271 days.  Doctors had to remove  the organ at the end of October, after they noticed a decline in function. But before that point, the transplant had worked so well that Andrews was able to take long walks and even throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game.\n \n\n   \n  The kind of research found in the new studies is important for the field, said Dr. Minnie Sarwal, co-director of the Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program at the University of California San Francisco.   \n \n\n   \n  “Sixty-one days of stable renal function is novel proof of concept, and I think it confirms that genetically engineered pig kidneys can sustain physiological function in human circulation,” said Sarwal, who was not involved with the new research. “As a first step, proof of concept, clearly, is very important, because it is bridging the gap between what we were previously worked working on with short lived preclinical models, and we are able to go to true clinical feasibility, even though it’s obviously not long-term. But 61 days is better than, let’s say, hours, or maybe a few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Sarwal, who focuses on therapeutic innovations for immunosuppression drug design, said the new studies also demonstrated that rejection was treatable.\n \n\n   \n  “That part’s not groundbreaking, but I think it’s very comforting that our current treatments would work in that model, which we expected they would, but confirmation is great to see,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Mapping immune reaction may give researchers other “druggable molecular checkpoints” so they can develop better immunosuppression options for transplant recipients, Sarwal said.\n \n\n   \n  Montgomery thinks his experiment can also give hope that xenotransplantation will be a more viable option someday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting better and better at this, and I think that’s the message that I would like to deliver,” Montgomery said. “There’s going to be ups and downs. Nothing worth doing isn’t fraught with some complications.”\n \n\n   \n  But, he added, “it’s all solveable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/george-conway-us-house-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:26:00-05:00","title":"George Conway, a prominent Trump critic, may jump into New York congressional race, source tells CNN","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"George Conway, a well-known legal critic of Donald Trump and former spouse of Kellyanne Conway, is reportedly considering a run for the Democratic primary in New York’s 12th Congressional District, a seat currently held by Jerry Nadler, who has announced he will not seek reelection.

The organization supports older adults in New York City by providing health services like offering meals at their adult centers or delivering meals to seniors that are homebound. In a statement sent to CNN, Gayle M. Horwitz, JASA CEO, writes:\n \n\n   \n  “For low-income older adults, SNAP isn’t just a program; it’s the difference between a full fridge and empty cupboards. The loss of these benefits forces too many seniors to choose between buying food, medication, and paying rent. Even before these cuts, our community was already seeing older adults forced to skip meals and rely on emergency food programs. We see every day how devastating these cuts are; there’s simply no substitute for SNAP’s vital lifeline.”\n \n\n   \n  Communities across the country are facing similar issues and several charities have begun providing assistance to those in need.\n \n\n   \n  Impact Your World has compiled a list of organizations that are fundraising around this cause.

       11:01 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate have once again raised questions over  Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor ’s account of his friendship with the late sex offender and his denials of the allegations of his accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The former prince told Epstein and convicted child sex trafficker  Ghislaine Maxwell  “I can’t take any more of this” when informed 14 years ago that a British newspaper was going to publish a story about the trio.\n \n\n   \n  A fresh tranche of documents provided by Epstein’s estate, some of which also  mentioned US President Donald Trump , was released by the  US House Oversight Committee  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the thousands of documents was the email conversation from March 2011 in which Andrew repeatedly pleaded with the couple to make it clear that he had no involvement in the alleged activities.\n \n\n   \n  “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” Andrew wrote to Epstein. “I can’t take any more of this my end.”\n \n\n   \n  The messages were sent months after Andrew claimed to have severed all ties with the convicted pedophile in December 2010.  CNN has reached out to Andrew for comment following the latest release of material from the House committee.\n \n\n   \n  In what appears to be a separate email chain between the former Duke of York and Maxwell on the same day, discussing a response to the press enquiry from the Mail on Sunday newspaper, he wrote: “Hey there! What’s all this? I don’t know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can’t take any more of this.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew sent his messages after he was forwarded a right-to-reply email by Epstein from the newspaper, in which, he featured in several claims. The email alleged that a woman, whose name has been redacted in the released documents, worked as a masseuse for Epstein and met and had sex with Andrew at Maxwell’s London home in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  It alleged that the masseuse met Andrew again at Epstein’s New York residence where she and another girl were directed by Maxwell to sit on his knee, and he groped them before Maxwell directed the girls to have sex with him.\n \n\n   \n  It also alleged that the woman was later directed to stage an orgy for Andrew and Epstein on the financier’s private Caribbean island, Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  The emails appear to be referring to the claims of Virginia Giuffre, who has spoken extensively about her years of being sexually trafficked, allegedly at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein who  died by suicide  in April, repeatedly claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew while underage on three occasions – in London, New York and on Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  She alleged that third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein’s island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English,” as detailed in her posthumous memoir.\n \n\n   \n  She claimed that the-then prince  was aware  she was underage in the US when they were introduced.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew told the BBC in a television interview in 2019.  He said in the same sit-down that visiting Epstein in 2010  was the “wrong decision”  and that he regretted acting in a manner that was “unbecoming.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein confirms Andrew photo\n \n\n   \n  In another email exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein also appeared to discuss Giuffre and the now infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then-17-year-old. The now former royal has repeatedly said that he has  no recollection of the photograph  being taken and has suggested the image could be fake.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The disgraced financier also appeared to ask the journalist to investigate Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  “I never misled you, this girl is a total liar,” Epstein wrote in the email.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe your paper should jump on and show that (redacted)’s allegations re andrew (sic) are the same, she also accused numnerous (sic) people of having sex with her,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew reached an  out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, after  Giuffre’s memoir  reignited public attention on Andrew’s links to Epstein, he was officially  stripped of his titles  in an extraordinary move by his brother, King Charles III.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee  requested Andrew answer questions  as part of the panel’s investigation into Epstein and his accomplices. Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC that he has not responded yet to the committee’s invitation to testify.\n \n\n   \n    Mandelson in contact with Epstein until 2016, emails show\n \n\n   \n  The new cache of documents from the House committee also seem to shed further light on the extent of the contact between Epstein and Peter Mandelson, who was  recently fired  as British ambassador to the United States over his ties to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein’s birthday two weeks earlier. “63 years old. You made it,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that “you were right about staying away from Andrew.”\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson responds, “Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly what the two men are referring to. CNN has attempted to reach out to Mandelson for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson was fired as Britain’s ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship.\n \n\n   \n  Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson’s ties to Epstein were known prior to his appointment to the post in Washington in 2024. But the September emails sparked a crisis for Britain’s Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with many questioning why he appointed Mandelson despite concerns about his past.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Foreign Office told CNN at the time that the emails showed that “the depth and extent” of the now-ex-ambassador’s relationship with Epstein is “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  Following his dismissal two months ago, Mandelson said in a letter to embassy staff reported by the BBC that he continued “to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/entertainment/taylor-swift-eras-tour-documentary-trailer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:55:00-05:00","title":"Taylor Swift drops ‘Eras Tour’ doc trailer, with ‘mysterious forces at play’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Taylor Swift has released a trailer for her upcoming Disney+ docuseries, 'The End of an Era,' which explores the behind-the-scenes of her record-breaking 'Eras Tour.'

Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. Staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports will be frozen at 6%, the Department of Transportation said Wednesday night, stopping short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers are now showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain at that level until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “If the FAA safety team determines the trend lines are moving in the right direction, we’ll put forward a path to resume normal operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said Tuesday that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would allow airlines to restore operations before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  But that will take some time.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in an earlier statement.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a statement Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week if the government reopens quickly. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/government-shutdown-ends-federal-workers-return","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:16:00-04:00","title":"The government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government shutdown, which lasted 43 days and ended on November 13, 2025, has not restored normal operations.

things are not back to normal \n       \n  By Jeremy Herb, Tami Luhby, Sunlen Serfaty, René Marsh, Alexandra Skores, Ella Nilsen, Marshall Cohen, Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:16 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is over. But hundreds of thousands of federal workers   are coming back after 43 days to anything but normalcy, employees from across the country told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Workers who haven’t received a paycheck in weeks will still have to wait for back pay. Research grants will be delayed. Economic reports are likely to be scrapped. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through.\n \n\n   \n  And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers said that the shutdown has been an exclamation point on top of months of chaos as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and, in some cases, entire agencies since the president   took office in January. The administration  sought to fire  more federal workers when the shutdown hit, but the short-term funding deal halted those dismissals until the end of January.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it’s going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.”\n \n\n   \n  For the American public, the lingering effects of the shutdown could be felt for months or even years to come at the nation’s airports. Meanwhile, those receiving government assistance like food stamps are eagerly awaiting the government to finally get funds out the door.\n \n\n   \n    A slew of backlogs\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers back on the clock Thursday will need to assess how to address more than six weeks of   backlogs. Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee.\n \n\n   \n  A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check   their emails at approved times to look   for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn’t lock down after 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  It was “heart wrenching” to see the emails piling up, the person said, including with desperate pleas from parents of disabled children who filed discrimination cases with the department’s Office for Civil Rights. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency’s testing labs, said one worker at the agency’s   Human Foods Program.\n \n\n   \n  Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said.\n \n\n   \n  And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You’re talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.”\n \n\n   \n  A big focus at the National Park Service will be assessing any damage that occurred to parks during the shutdown, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n \n\n   \n  Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said.   But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, many parks didn’t get damaged,” Brengel said. “But this is unsustainable and everyone knows it.”\n \n\n   \n  At NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given,  CNN recently reported .\n \n\n   \n  Some of the sources CNN recently spoke to said they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by the Trump administration to quietly gut the Goddard campus during the shutdown — a claim a NASA spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA   engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.”\n \n\n   \n    When will employees receive back pay?\n \n\n   \n  When the  roughly 1.4 million federal workers  who have been furloughed or working without pay will receive their back pay may vary by agency. Many have  missed  two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, it only took a few   business days for workers to   be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left   amid the administration’s downsizing efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the complexity is that federal workers are not all paid at the same time since the government uses multiple pay systems, said Stier of Partnership for Public Service.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a huge undertaking on top of a lot of other things that the federal employees are going to have to be doing,” he said, though it should take a matter of days, not weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But   “until we get paid, everyone’s going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben   Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\n \n\n   \n    Effects on air travel could linger for years\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown brought chaos to US airports, and the impact   could linger well beyond  the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more   coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n   In May,   the Department of Transportation said   it would replace the decades-old Federal Aviation Administration infrastructure with a new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  At a Wednesday press conference at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said the software and upgrades the new system requires “would take longer than the three-year period,” originally promised.\n \n\n   \n    When will safety net programs be funded?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown wreaked havoc on the  nation’s safety net programs , most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly  42 million Americans  to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  Just when enrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will receive their  full benefits  for November will depend on where they live. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court  paused  a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending  partial benefits  last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month’s aid.\n \n\n   \n  After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. Some, however, could take up to a week to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The spending agreement signed into law takes the threat of another lapse of SNAP off the table in January when another shutdown could occur: The bill funded several agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, for the entire fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n \n\n   \n  It typically takes at least 30 days for the HHS to calculate states’ allocations and get the money out the door for LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. And he fears it will take even longer this year since  HHS laid off its LIHEAP staff  in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  Federal grants for the roughly 140 Head Start programs – serving more than 65,000 children and families – that were affected by the shutdown could take up to two weeks to distribute, said Tommy Sheridan, deputy director at the National Head Start Association.\n \n\n   \n  The funding lapse forced 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico to close. Other programs have been able to maintain their operations thanks for local and philanthropic support.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the timeline for getting funds to LIHEAP and Head Start programs, an HHS spokesperson said that the agency will “work swiftly” to administer LIHEAP annual awards. Head Start recipients can expect to receive communications that will include a timeline for the release of federal funds.\n \n\n   \n    Economics reports delayed\n \n\n   \n  Economic data released by the government — which is used by business leaders and the Federal Reserve to assess the state of the US economy — has been suspended throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Monthly employment reports for September and October haven’t been released, and neither has the first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Once the government reopens, statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release updated schedules on data releases.\n \n\n   \n  But this is the first time there have been two delayed jobs reports. And it’s likely that October’s report will never be released, as data for the month was not collected, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period,” Leavitt told reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Headed for the exit?\n \n\n   \n  Caitlin Lewis, who runs  CivicMatch , which connects federal employees with jobs in state or local governments, said the shutdown has pushed many federal workers to the exits.\n \n\n   \n  There was a 74% spike in federal workers signing up for the platform during the first five weeks of the shutdown, she said, compared to the five weeks before the shutdown. Last week was one of the platform’s busiest weeks in months.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year.\n \n\n   \n  “People want to stick it out as long as they can. But this is the latest in a deep cycle of instability that is pushing public servants out of the government since the inauguration,” Lewis said.\n \n\n   \n  When the last government shutdown ended in 2019, a USDA employee returned to find dozens of emails from state agencies with policy questions, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her work and how much she is needed.\n \n\n   \n  But the stress of this year’s record-long impasse has forced her to start looking for other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “This has been the worst six weeks that I can remember,” said the staffer, who had planned a career with the government. “I cannot afford to go through this again, mentally or financially.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/middleeast/west-bank-mosque-graffiti-settlers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"09:16:00-05:00","title":"Israeli settlers torch mosque and spray graffiti in latest West Bank attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Israeli settlers carried out a violent attack on the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit, West Bank, torching it and defacing it with racist graffiti such as 'Mohammed is a pig' and referencing IDF commander Avi Bluth.

A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian economy ministry on Wednesday called on the international community to take action to stop the attacks. In Tuesday’s incident, perpetrators set fire to four trucks loaded with products from Al-Juneidi, and smashed windows and other property, it said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Anarchist fringe youth’\n \n\n   \n  A senior official from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) condemned the violence. “The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious,” Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth said in a statement shared by the IDF on Wednesday. “It must be dealt with firmly.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued it was unacceptable for “lawbreakers” to “harm property and innocent civilians” while diverting the IDF’s focus “away from its mission of security and counterterrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/holiday-travel-spirit-airlines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Flying Will Stay Rough After the Shutdown.

Why? Spirit Airlines \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Relatively few people fly Spirit Airlines – but the company could still affect how much you pay for your holiday travel, even if recent government-mandated flight cancellations end.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Spirit has had an outsized effect on fares across the industry. The discount carrier’s rock-bottom fares forced much larger carriers, such as American, Delta and United Airlines, to keep their prices lower. That includes offering lower-priced seats at the back of planes, often on the same no-frills basis as Spirit.\n \n\n   \n  But Spirit, facing severe financial hardship, is now a fraction of the size it was just a year ago. That is impacting fares this holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  Even if flight cancellations because of the government shutdown are restored, there will be nearly 11,000 fewer Spirit flights this holiday season compared to last year, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium analyzed by CNN. That includes the period six days before Thanksgiving through the Sunday after New Year’s Day. The drop represents a one-third reduction in Spirit’s schedule, or a loss of nearly 2 million available seats.\n \n\n   \n  US domestic flights are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site Going.com.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I can’t pinpoint that and say all of that is attributable to Spirit,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for Going.com. “But it definitely is contributing to the higher prices we’re seeing.”\n \n\n   \n  Like most other low-cost carriers, Spirit has continually lost money since 2020, when the pandemic hit. Now in the midst of its  second bankruptcy reorganization,  the company once again warned investors on Tuesday there was “ substantial doubt ” over its ability to stay in business over the next 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Spirit is shuttering immediately. But the airline has been slashing flights in a desperate effort to stem losses, offering far fewer routes.\n \n\n   \n  The routes of virtually every US airline now have less overlap with Spirit than before, Raymond James airlines analyst Savanthi Syth said in a note to clients this week.   And with Spirit flying on fewer routes, the carrier won’t put nearly as much downward pressure on the fares of larger airlines.\n \n\n   \n  In August, when Spirit  first warned investors  about possibly being forced out of business, Spirit CEO Dave Davis told   employees the airline remained “critical” for flyers.\n \n\n   \n  “We have saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, whether they fly with us or not,” he wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/nfl-week-11-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-05:00","title":"5 Things to Watch in the NFL’s Week 11: Spain Game, Revenge, MVP, and Mega Showdowns","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NFL’s Week 11 schedule features a historic first regular-season game in Spain, where the Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders play at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, marking the seventh country outside the U.S. to host such a game.

Spain becomes the seventh country outside the United States to host an NFL regular-season game, joining Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil and Ireland.\n \n\n   \n  So set those alarms early on Sunday – kickoff from Madrid is at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n    Falcons out for revenge\n \n\n   \n  The Atlanta Falcons will have extra motivation Sunday when they host the Carolina Panthers. The last time these two met in Week 3, Carolina rolled to a 30-0 win.\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta has dropped four straight and sits at 3-6. The offense has been brutal, converting just three third downs in its last three games – 3 for 29 in that span. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will need to steady the ship if the Falcons hope to stop the slide.\n \n\n   \n  The good news? Their next three opponents – Panthers, Saints and Jets – are all beatable.\n \n\n   \n    Stafford’s MVP case\n \n\n   \n  Matthew Stafford is on a tear. The Los Angeles Rams quarterback is rewriting the record book, becoming the first in NFL history to throw 20 touchdown passes without an interception over a six-game stretch.\n \n\n   \n  In his last three outings alone, Stafford has tossed 13 touchdowns. He’s now tied with New England’s Drake Maye as a favorite for league MVP.\n \n\n   \n  Another milestone: By beating the 49ers last week, Stafford’s career record finally hit .500 at 115-115-1. After all those rough years in Detroit, that’s no small feat. A win Sunday against the 7-2 Seahawks would give him a winning record for the first time – and first place in the NFC West.\n \n\n   \n     More Mile High Magic? \n \n\n   \n  Every week, the Denver Broncos seem to pull another rabbit out of the hat.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payton’s team has punted more than any team in the league, yet they have won a league-high seven straight and sits atop the AFC West at 8-2.\n \n\n   \n  During this streak, Denver’s margin for error has been razor-thin – wins by 4, 3 (twice), 2 and 1 point.\n \n\n   \n  At some point, the one-score magic runs out… or maybe this team just has it.\n \n\n   \n  But this week’s test is different: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs visit Mile High. The Chiefs are coming off a bye and a loss to Buffalo. History says that’s bad news for Denver – Andy Reid is 22-4 after a bye week.\n \n\n   \n    Lions vs. Eagles in a mega showdown\n \n\n   \n  Sunday Night Football brings a heavyweight NFC clash as the Philadelphia Eagles host the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The defending champs are 7-2, but their fans still feel disrespected. When the stage is big, the Eagles usually deliver – since 2021, they’ve won 10 straight against the Lions, Rams and Packers.\n \n\n   \n  Lions head coach Dan Campbell recently took over play-calling duties, and it paid off immediately with 44 points on Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The Eagles’ defense, though, is a much tougher test. This one could easily be a preview of the NFC Championship Game.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/homes/portable-mortgages-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:00","title":"The Trump administration is ‘actively evaluating’ portable mortgages.

Pulte – who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-backed entities that guarantee more than half of US mortgages – said officials are also weighing  how to make mortgages assumable  and whether to introduce  a new 50-year mortgage option .\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%,  according  to a Redfin analysis of FHFA data. However, average mortgage rates have remained stubbornly stuck between 6% and 7% for the last few years. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates have been less willing to move and potentially pay hundreds more in interest each month on new mortgages at current rates.\n \n\n   \n  Allowing people to keep their lower mortgage rates could encourage them to move and free up supply. But there are questions about how that would work and whether it might wind up actually raising mortgage rates overall, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by CNN, the FHFA did not provide further details about its plans for portable mortgages. In a statement, a spokesperson said the agency was studying a “wide variety of options” to lower housing costs.\n \n\n   \n    How do portable mortgages work?\n \n\n   \n  A portable mortgage allows a borrower to transfer their existing mortgage and mortgage rate to a new property when they move, instead of taking out a brand-new loan.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, imagine a homeowner selling their house for $400,000 with half of that paid off on a 3% mortgage. With a portable mortgage, they could sell their home and transfer the $200,000 left on the loan to the new house, keeping the 3% rate.\n \n\n   \n  Things get trickier if the new home is more expensive. If it costs $450,000, for example, the buyer would need to cover the extra $50,000 either in cash or through a second, smaller loan likely issued at the current higher interest rate.\n \n\n   \n  The hope is that if homeowners could move without losing their low rates, more homes would go up for sale, giving buyers who’ve been locked out a better shot, Wachter said. But the effects on supply would likely be limited, and it might take Congress passing a law to iron out legal wrinkles.\n \n\n   \n    Might this backfire?\n \n\n   \n  Portable mortgages could disrupt the engine powering the US housing market: mortgage-backed securities. Those are essentially bundles of mortgages that banks or lenders sell to investors, which gives the banks the cash they need to issue new loans and keep the mortgage market flowing.\n \n\n   \n  If homeowners can take their loans with them when they move, fewer loans will be paid off early – which means more risk for investors, who might demand higher interest rates to compensate, Wachter said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, mortgage agreements are clear contracts tied to a specific property, with the home’s address listed as collateral. Transferring that loan to a new house would mean effectively rewriting the contract.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s too early to tell what’s going to happen, but it’s going to be a logistical nightmare,” said Justin Demola, the president of Lenders One, a national alliance of mortgage bankers. “All mortgages have a property address, a legal description. How do you get around that as you’re taking the mortgage to the next property?”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the administration considering?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is also looking into a 50-year mortgage, but the proposal  has drawn backlash  from some housing experts. They argue that the monthly savings would be minimal compared to the significantly higher interest costs over the loan’s life versus a standard 30-year fixed mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  The administration also brought up potentially allowing more assumable loans, meaning homebuyers can take over a seller’s existing mortgage and mortgage rate. Most government-backed loans, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, are already assumable. In fact, there are companies that help buyers find homes with assumable mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  However, Demola said he doesn’t see many first-time homebuyers assuming other people’s mortgages, since doing so typically requires a large cash payment or a second mortgage to buy out the existing loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Loans have been assumable forever. You don’t really see many being assumed right now,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/jesse-jackson-hospitalized-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:45:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rev.

world \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:14 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For two nights, dazzling auroras delighted sky-gazers in unexpected places, including in the US as far south as Florida. The cause: dual solar storms unleashed by the sun reaching Earth.\n \n\n   \n  A severe storm was initially predicted for Thursday as well, with the potential for the northern tier of the US to see auroras again in the evening. Forecasters at the National Weather Service’s  Space Weather Prediction Center  now believe Wednesday night might have been the last opportunity for the most intense conditions.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to creating auroral displays, geomagnetic storms can disrupt   communications, the power grid and satellite operations. The Space Weather Prediction Center said it had otified power grid and satellite operators in the US so they could prepare.\n \n\n   \n  The British Geological Survey initially believed the current solar activity could lead to a G5, or an extreme geomagnetic storm — the highest level on the scale. The survey also dubbed Tuesday’s event a “cannibal storm” that disrupted communications and GPS satellite accuracy.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, two Coronal Mass Ejections lifted off the sun a few hours apart,” the survey’s geomagnetism team explained. “The first one was moving more slowly than the second  …  and so the second one caught up with the first one and they amalgamated together by the time they reached Earth. Hence, the term ‘cannibalised,’ as the second one gobbled up the first one.”\n \n\n   \n  Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in geomagnetic storms.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters at the Space Weather Prediction Center believe that the arrivals of the first two of three anticipated coronal mass ejections caused   Tuesday evening’s auroral display.\n \n\n   \n  “One of them packed a much stronger punch than we would have imagined originally,” said Shawn Dahl, forecaster at the center.\n \n\n   \n  When a storm reaches satellites stationed 1 million miles from Earth, forecasters can measure its speed, the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic orientation, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it pointed opposite Earth, or is it pointed the same as Earth?” Dahl said. “If it turns opposite Earth, then activity really quickly escalates, and those storm levels can dramatically increase very quickly. That’s what happened last night.”\n \n\n   \n  The third solar storm arrived at Earth Wednesday afternoon at 2:17 p.m. ET, with solar wind speeds over 2.1 million miles per hour (950 kilometers per second).\n \n\n   \n  But Earth appears to have been struck by a far flanking edge of the storm, meaning most of the magnetic cloud likely missed our planet, according to an  update from the center .\n \n\n   \n    Solar storm disruptions\n \n\n   \n  Among those feeling the storm’s effects is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The company was  expected to launch  NASA’s  Escapade mission  — twin satellites   set to head on a long journey to Mars — aboard its New Glenn rocket Wednesday. But the increased solar activity blocked that launch attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch,” according to a  post by Blue Origin  on social media platform   X. The company confirmed on X Wednesday evening that another launch attempt is now scheduled for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of activity around our sun   sparked the storms. Three X-class flares, the most intense type of solar flare, have released from the sun this week, followed by a series of coronal mass ejections.\n \n\n   \n  The recent surge in activity stems from an active region of sunspots on the sun called AR 14274, according to Ryan French, a solar physicist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  “AR 14274 still has the potential to produce more X-class solar flares,” French said. “However, the region is now rotating away from us, so any eruptions from future flares are increasingly less likely to hit us as the days pass.”\n \n\n   \n  An X-class flare released Tuesday created a large solar particle storm, the largest since 2005, according to the British Geological Survey. Tuesday’s solar activity also created the largest measured geoelectric field since the survey’s records began in 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field can reach the ground, which triggers electricity in rocks and essentially creates an electric field in the ground. “This is usually tiny on the order of 0.001 Volt per kilometer but during geomagnetic storms it can be much larger,” the survey team noted.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, experts documented a value of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, an unusually large number that “has not been recorded before,” according to the geological survey’s team.\n \n\n   \n  Large geoelectric fields can interfere with transformers and may even cause them to shut down or overheat.\n \n\n   \n    A changing solar cycle\n \n\n   \n  The sun has an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity. Heliophysicists believe the peak, called  solar maximum , occurred in October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we are still in a period of heightened solar activity, we are entering the decay phase of the solar cycle,” French said.   “(Although) sunspots and solar flares are fewer during this time, this is the period where the strongest solar flares typically occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up.\n \n\n   \n  For those in areas   with clear dark skies, keep an eye out for auroras, which could dip over the US. In the UK, sky-gazers in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland had a good chance of seeing them as well, according to the survey.\n \n\n   \n  The last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in  May 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  The storm was a historic one, but fortunately it didn’t reach the level of the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire and remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded.\n \n\n   \n  During the May 2024 geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.\n \n\n   \n  Before May 2024, the last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The recent outburst of activity reminds French of a severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth in  October 2024 . Tuesday night’s storm clocked in as third strongest solar storm of the current solar cycle, French said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-04:00","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities plan to deport over 89 sick Palestinian patients — including children, the elderly, and those with critical medical conditions — from East Jerusalem back to Gaza, despite the fact that Gaza's healthcare system is nearly nonfunctional due to extensive destruction.

 By Abeer Salman and Zeena Saifi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:32 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Yamen Al-Najjar recalls his past life – the days when he went to school and laughed regularly. Today, the 16-year-old lives with his mother in a cramped 6-square-meter room, just large enough to hold a hospital bed he seldom leaves.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is hard. I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities have decided to send all Gazan patients back home next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen and his mother are among at least 89 Gazan patients and their companions due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization has been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients early next week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT about the potential deportation of sick Palestinians to Gaza but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.”\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been update to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/halligan-us-attorney-comey-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Judge hears arguments Thursday in bid by James Comey and Letitia James to disqualify Lindsey Halligan","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia appointed by President Donald Trump, is at the center of a legal challenge by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who argue that her appointment violates federal law by exceeding the 120-day limit for interim US Attorneys.

That period had elapsed by the time Halligan was installed as the interim US attorney for the judicial district in September.\n \n\n   \n  And, Comey’s and James’ defense attorneys say, the clock should not be reset just because a new person was appointed.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers, Comey’s attorneys warned that if the attorney general, who makes the appointments, could do so “back-to-back,” then the “120-day period would be rendered meaningless, and the Attorney General could indefinitely evade the alternate procedures that Congress mandated.”\n \n\n   \n  Under federal law, if the Senate hasn’t confirmed a nominee to serve in the role long-term and the 120-day period has passed, the judges in that judicial district must pick someone to serve in the role. In May, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia picked Erik Siebert, whose time as interim US attorney was coming to a close, to continue serving in the job.\n \n\n   \n   In Comey’s case,  his attorneys further argue that a different prosecutor wouldn’t be able to seek a new indictment against the former FBI director since the five-year statute of limitations in his case has already expired.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has  strongly pushed back , saying in court filings that even if the judge were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether because the indictments don’t “hinge on her validly holding that particular office” of interim US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the department have also claimed that Attorney General Pam Bondi can appoint a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.” But several other judges who have considered similar challenges to US attorneys in other states have rejected that argument in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge to Halligan’s authority is being heard in Alexandria, Virginia, by senior US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton who ordinarily sits in South Carolina. Currie was tapped to handle this part of the two cases given the role the other judges in the Eastern District of Virginia play in ensuring there is a top prosecutor in their district.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  James was charged last month with two counts: bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection to a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia. She has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Both trials are tentatively set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-cemetery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Black Soldiers in WWII Removed From U.S. Military Cemetery Spark Local Outcry","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During World War II, Black soldiers like Jefferson Wiggins were tasked with burying American soldiers in Margraten, Netherlands, despite facing systemic racism and being excluded from combat roles.

That’s not the issue,” Wiggins’ widow, Janice, told CNN. “The issue is that these are a group of men who contributed to their country, who, like almost every soldier during World War II, went through great trauma and bore that for the rest of their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins, who learned of the display’s removal in October from two Dutch filmmakers, said her late husband would “be disappointed, but not shocked.”\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t naive about the world he lived in,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC, which  oversees 26 permanent US military cemeteries , told CNN in a statement that the panel in question was taken down following “an internal review of interpretive content” under the agency’s previous secretary, Charles Djou, and there are currently four other displays highlighting individual African American servicemembers buried at the cemetery.\n \n\n   \n  Djou, a Biden appointee who says he was dismissed by President Donald Trump in April, told CNN in an email the panel’s removal was “done via an internal agency review at the prompting of the Trump administration.” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC said, “The panel was initially added upon request by the former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was determined by the previous secretary, following the internal review in March, that while 1st Lt. Wiggins’ quote represented the immense contributions of many African American service members during the creation of the site, portions of the panels were outside the scope of ABMC’s commemorative mission. There was no external consultation or direction regarding its removal.”\n \n\n   \n  The panel, which was added to an exhibit at the cemetery’s $6.7 million visitor center in 2024, was titled, “African American Servicemembers in WWII: Fighting on Two Fronts.” It described how Black service members, “despite the ongoing fight for civil rights at home during an era of racist policies” enlisted in every military branch and faced “the horrors of war.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins pushed for a panel shortly after the center opened in 2023, when she learned that none of the information or exhibits included any mention of the African American soldiers who buried the dead there. She worked with the former US Ambassador to the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal, and Mieke Kirkels, a Dutch oral historian, and the panel was installed months later.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The stark reality’\n \n\n   \n  Wiggins waited until the late 2000s to revisit the memories of his service, which he would recount to Kirkels for an oral history after learning that he was the last known Black member of his unit alive.\n \n\n   \n  The first person they buried was a young German girl, Wiggins recalled in the oral history  rereleased in 2025 . Her body had been mangled by machine gun fire; her head deformed by a grenade blast. As the Allied forces pressed on, more and more bodies of young American men arrived on trucks for Wiggins and his men to lay to rest. Many had been killed during airborne operations in the east or in the course of advances into German territory.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a permanent arrival of bodies, the whole day long. Sundays included, seven days a week,” Wiggins said. “I find it difficult, even now, to read in the paper that soldiers ‘gave their lives.’ … All those boys in Margraten, their lives were taken away.”\n \n\n   \n  “And here we all were - this group of Black Americans having to deal with these bodies of White Americans,” he said. “The stark reality was we had to bury those soldiers although we couldn’t sit in the same room with them when they were alive.”\n \n\n   \n  For Wiggins, remembering what he saw was a painful, but necessary act. Janice Wiggins said he would often tell her that “people should know.” The contributions of Black soldiers during the war had been frequently overlooked — and in some cases lost forever. A fire at the  National Personnel Records Center  in 1973 destroyed millions of files.\n \n\n   \n  “He never ever wanted the story to be about him. He saw his story as a vehicle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, a sharecropper’s son who had lied about his age to enlist in the military, became a lifelong educator and civil rights activist. He was 87 when he died.\n \n\n   \n    Removal causes local uproar\n \n\n   \n  Theo Bovens, a Dutch politician who leads the  Black Liberators in the Netherlands  project, told CNN that local and regional politicians have asked the ABMC to reinstall the panel, along with another that highlights Technician 4th Class George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier from Camden, New Jersey, who died while trying to save a fellow soldier who had fallen into a river in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC told CNN on Monday that the Pruitt panel is “currently off display, though not out of rotation.” The part of the exhibit featuring Pruitt and other African American servicemembers at the cemetery, the agency said, has panels that were “designed to be removed and rotated.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins told CNN that the “panels were never intended to be part of a traveling exhibit or rotation” and “were intended to be a permanent part of the Visitors Center exhibits.”\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Eijsden-Margraten has formally asked the ABMC to reinstall the panels, insisting that the community values the contributions of Black American soldiers that helped liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis 80 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The governing body of the Limburg Province said it hopes to make a direct appeal to US Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo Jr. who was confirmed in October.\n \n\n   \n  “The displayed panels depicted a history we must never forget, and from which we can learn a great deal—especially now, as global divisions are being increasingly magnified,” the body said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/job-prices-debt-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Things are pretty crappy: 1 in 4 US households are living paycheck to paycheck","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, an estimated 24% of U.S. households are living paycheck to paycheck, spending over 95% of their income on essentials.

But right now, the 34-year-old is barely getting by.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is living paycheck to paycheck and saving almost no money, one of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unaffordable economy.\n \n\n   \n  Worse, the family-owned construction business he works at is shutting down.\n \n\n   \n  “I am going to be unemployed in the next month or two – with no safety net,” said Austin, who declined to share his last name.\n \n\n   \n  An estimated 24% of US households are living paycheck to paycheck so far in 2025, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis released this week. The bank’s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  They found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the “nice-to-have” things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.\n \n\n   \n     No margin for error \n \n\n   \n  Austin, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said he’s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year – everything from teaching to construction – with no luck.\n \n\n   \n  “To be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to own a house and start a family, but I don’t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Living in two different worlds’ \n \n\n   \n  The Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.\n \n\n   \n  Many are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trump  dismisses affordability concerns  as a “con job” conjured up by Democrats based on “fake” polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  “Higher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,” Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n     A growing wage gap \n \n\n   \n  The problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices – especially now that  inflation has reaccelerated. \n \n\n   \n  After-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That’s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.\n \n\n   \n  Wage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Wadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn’t been this high since 2016.\n \n\n   \n     ‘We’re getting nowhere’ \n \n\n   \n  For Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.\n \n\n   \n  Wages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.\n \n\n   \n  “We work full-time and have degrees. And we’re getting nowhere,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY - Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the “deepening affordability crisis” caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.\n \n\n   \n  For the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.\n \n\n   \n  “This could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,” Daco said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing “risk of labor market deterioration.” The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That’s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.\n \n\n   \n     Subprime auto loan troubles \n \n\n   \n  Some Americans are falling behind on their bills – especially those with low credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least  60 days late on their car loans  climbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  That is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  This trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.\n \n\n   \n  Bank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,” said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.\n \n\n   \n  Vanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn’t make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “The cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven’t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with “astronomical” medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  Jones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,” she said. “They need to walk in our shoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/style/escaramuza-cowgirl-fashion-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:56:00-04:00","title":"Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home – A Cultural Fight for Women in Equestrianism","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Escaramuza, an all-female equestrian sport from Mexico, has long challenged gender norms in traditional male-dominated horsemanship.

But the job isn’t done \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:56 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What does a cowgirl look like? For some, the question may call forth images of flanneled shirts, Stetson hats and bootcut jeans. But in escaramuza, the all-female equestrian sport imported by the US from Mexico, the answer is a little different.\n \n\n   \n  Before every escaramuza competition, each team lines up to have its uniforms measured. Strict guidelines dictate that the riders’ tiered Victoriana dresses, often vivid in color and trimmed with lace, must be long enough to cover their horses’ haunches. Glitter and beading are prohibited, but any accessories from earrings to brooches must match. Boots, too, should be identical throughout a team. Under each dress is a petticoat layer, as well as a pair of bloomers — both are to be steamed. One missing underlayer can disqualify the entire squad.\n \n\n   \n  Once they have passed their inspection, these spectacularly clad women go on to perform an elaborate synchronized routine while riding side-saddle. Their frothing dresses become fast-moving flurries of pink, purple and sky blue as they gallop across the arena.\n \n\n   \n  Photographer Constance Jaeggi spent the best part of two years traveling across the US to California, Texas, Idaho, Colorado, Oregon and Washington D.C. photographing these women, first for an exhibition at The National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, and later for the upcoming book “ Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home .”\n \n\n   \n  This visual clash — the strong, muscular horse working beneath layers of delicate petticoats — is one beloved by fashion. Dior’s former designer Maria Grazia Chiuri was inspired by the traditional costume of escaramuza, as seen via the brand’s 2019 Cruise runway show; while the September 2025 issue of Vogue, featured self-described horse girls Kendal Jenner and Gigi Hadid atop great steeds in lacy McQueen dresses.\n \n\n   \n  Jaeggi hopes people will come for her vibrant portraits of beautifully dressed women, and stay for a more layered and complex story about feminism, immigration and personal sacrifice. “I think the fashion aspect of it is the easy entry point,” Jaeggi said in a video interview.\n \n\n   \n  Along with taking their photograph, Jaeggi would watch hours of team rehearsals and often ate dinner with her subjects in their home. She interviewed the women and passed along their recorded conversations to Mexican-American writers Ire’ne Lara Silva, the 2023 Texas State Poet Laureate, and Angelina Sáenz, who wrote 15 accompanying poems each in both Spanish and English. The result is a tale of two halves — the calm, predictable waters of Jaeggi’s images, versus a tense storm brewing in the words of the poets.\n \n\n   \n   “When I started researching and speaking to the escaramuza, I realized how important the oral histories were to their story,” she said. Jaeggi was also “hyper aware” of the fact that she isn’t Mexican-American herself. “I don’t have that cultural, personal connection and I felt it was important to make sure that was a major part of the work.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead of visiting the sport’s home country, Jaeggi was instead drawn to the women who were working hard to establish escaramuza in the US. “In Mexico, it really is the sport of the wealthy,” she said. But the performers she met, most of them first or second generation immigrants, told a different story. From bake sales to fund the cost of the extravagant, hand-made dresses for competitions (the gowns cost roughly $300 to $400 each and are imported across the Mexican border) to putting gas in each others cars, the teams Jaeggi met were financially interdependent communities with one shared goal: furthering their athletic craft.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the stories I kept hearing was that it took them years, like a couple of generations, to be able to afford to have horses and to be able to do this sport,” she said. “It made it even more impressive to me, the fact that they dedicate so many of their resources to it.” When discussions moved onto the topic of immigration “there was some hesitance” for women to go on the record, Jaeggi said, because they were undocumented. That was in 2023 — before President Trump’s mission of  mass deportation  and deployment of ICE. “It’s a difficult political climate right now,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout Jaeggi’s book, there is an undercurrent of inequality that regularly bubbles to the surface. Escaramuza is a five- to 10-minute drop in the three-hour ocean of traditional charrería — the exclusively male ranching and horsemanship competition that is also Mexico’s national sport. Charrería was declared as Mexico’s national sport in 1933, though women were only allowed to perform as an entertaining half-time show in 1953. Escaramuza was not recognized as an athletic competitive event until 1992. Even today, the uniforms of male riders are not inspected as rigorously as their female counterparts, Jaeggi notes, a reason she coyly attributes to “interesting gender dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  While the women are eager to maintain their traditions and culture, they feel weighed down by the sport’s strict, essentialist views on gender. It’s a knotty back-and-forth that mostly comes through in writing. “Women/Are second class citizens in this sport,” reads one line of a Sáenz poem, “You are prettier when you are quiet.” In another work, “Machetona,” Silva interprets the struggle of a lesbian teammate who tries to rally against the inherent misogyny of escaramuza. The history of side-saddle, for example, comes from the fear that riding astride risks breaking a woman’s hymen, compromising the evidence of her virginity and, therefore, her value.\n \n\n   \n  “When it came to issues around gender and feminism, and pushing against some of these gender boundaries, I think most women were really willing to talk about it,” Jaeggi said. “They felt like their voices weren’t always heard in their community, and so there was a lot of frustration that was coming out. Those were really great conversations.”\n \n\n   \n  In “The Poetics of Home,” pride and frustration are intermingled in equal parts. But all can agree that an imperfect community is better than none. The “sisterhood,” as escaramuza is often referred to in the book, gives these women purpose, direction and a sense of belonging. “A sisterhood/Born of struggling and dreaming and training,” reads Silva’s poem “Lo Nuestro.” And as much as this sport is rooted in heritage, the women competing today have their sights set on the future. Jaeggi remembers a conversation with an escaramuza rider, who told her that “one of the main reasons she does this sport is she wants little girls, the next generation, to see that as a woman, you too can ride a horse.”\n \n\n   \n  “For a long time within charrería they weren’t,” she said. “The thought of having a woman compete alongside a man, or ride alongside a man on a horse, was unthinkable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/house-vote-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00-05:00","title":"How Each House Member Voted on Ending the Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives approved a Senate-backed funding bill on November 12, 2025, to end a record-setting government shutdown.

Epstein also wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Trump in a 2018 email to a White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. The disgraced financier also emailed about Trump’s mental state in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the emails, saying  they prove “nothing. ” Trump  accused Democrats of bringing up  Epstein to “deflect” from their handling of  the government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporters went through the thousands of files, and you can read highlights below:\n \n\n   \n    Here’s what’s written in some of the emails\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kaitlin Collins \n \n\n   \n  CNN reviewed some of the emails released from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee this morning in which Jeffrey Epstein mentions President Donald Trump by name.\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [REDACTED] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee  identified  the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s  interview earlier this year  with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, she denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the president has denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein called Trump ‘borderline insane’ in 2018, newly released documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In one of the thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee today, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein called President Donald Trump “borderline insane” in a 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump – borderline insane,” Epstein wrote on December 22, 2018.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what prompted the exchange between Epstein and Summers.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein associates sent him updates on Trump selling his jet, newly released documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  Some of the emails among the thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee today show Jeffrey Epstein getting updates about Donald Trump selling a private plane.\n \n\n   \n  In a message from April 2011, someone told Epstein, “I hear Trump has a contract on his B272” but “no money has changed hands” yet. The sender is redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Someone told Epstein in a May 2011 email, “Trump’s B727 sold for 2.7M.” The sender is redacted, but Epstein and an accountant and lawyer were copied.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein called Trump ‘f**king crazy’ in January 2017 email, new documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  A week after Donald Trump was inaugurated to his first term as US president, he signed an executive order  banning the entry  of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, widely referred to as the “Muslim ban.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffrey Epstein said in an email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017: “IT helps as he is seen as keeping his word.”\n \n\n   \n  He added later in the email: “That being said Donald is f**king crazy, I told you that.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein discussed Trump’s 2016 campaign with Soon-Yi Previn, new documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  The emails show an interesting exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and Soon-Yi Previn, the wife of controversial filmmaker Woody Allen.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent an article to Previn, titled, “Bill Clinton’s CIA chief joins Trump campaign.”  The article , published by The Hill in September 2016, was about the former Clinton-appointed CIA director James Woolsey joining Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Woody said it doesn’t mean anything,” Previn wrote in response to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why Epstein flagged the news to Previn and what if any interest she or her husband would have had in Woolsey’s involvement with Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell coordinated public response after 2015 lawsuit alleged sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In January 2015, an anonymous woman – later revealed to be Virginia Roberts Giuffre –  filed a lawsuit  alleging that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell groomed and sexually abused her between 1998 and 2002. The lawsuit alleged they forced her to become a “sex slave” to powerful men – including a royal prince later revealed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Mountbatten-Windsor, who  has been stripped of his prince title , has denied the allegation and  later settled a lawsuit  Giuffre filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  In several email exchanges on January 10, 2015, after the lawsuit was filed, Epstein and Maxwell coordinated their public response to the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Initial response, too many unanswered question [sic] raised, relationship with jeffrey/…I am writing to writin [sic] to respond to alleagtinoin [sic] that have been made wchich [sic] are categorically untrue,” Epstein wrote Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded by asking if her lawyer could speak with a lawyer, then wrote: “I have to distance myself from you in statement too. And they need me to say I was not aware of massage w/ andrew in my house. These things they have to stay along w/ meeting [REDACTED] and rebutting those allegations. I needs it asap.”\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein assured Maxwell he was on the phone with his lawyer about getting her a lawyer, she replied, “I need it written out in full.”\n \n\n   \n  “Call me,” Epstein replied.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell later  settled  a defamation lawsuit with Giuffre in June 2017 for an undisclosed sum.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the Justice Department this summer, Maxwell said her relationship with Epstein was  “almost nonexistent”  between 2010 and 2019 outside of corresponding over legal matters.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and a former Obama official\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In a March 24, 2018, email chain with  Kathryn   Ruemmler , a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein  shared  a Daily Beast article titled, “How Close Is Donald Trump to a Psychiatric Breakdown?”\n \n\n   \n  The exchange shows Epstein forwarding the story early that morning to Ruemmler, with her replying: “Not confidence inspiring.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein then responded: “but – accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  A year earlier in July 2017, Ruemmler wrote an email to Epstein saying, “Trump is truly stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  “Duh,” Epstein replied several hours later.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler and Epstein were corresponding at the time.\n \n\n   \n  But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   \n  Ruemmler did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2018, Epstein emailed Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior, writing:\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power. tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Epstein forwarded the same comment to Reid Weingarten, an  attorney  who worked for him.\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten replied that Trump was “starting to behave very erratically.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back: “borderline insane. and corroborated by some that are close.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein questioned whether Trump had ‘early dementia’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In early January 2018, as questions swirled about Trump’s behavior  following the release  of Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury,” Epstein exchanged a series of emails with a reporter at The New York Times discussing the president’s mental state.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the reporter an  excerpt  of the book that ran in New York Magazine.\n \n\n   \n  The reporter remarked that Trump was “looking/sounding increasingly unhinged,” Epstein replies, “no questions donalds statement is goofy. . early dementia?”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed then-Prince Andrew: ‘you ok?’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kara Scannell \n \n\n   \n  In March 2011, as the Epstein scandal was picked up by British tabloids focusing on then-Prince Andrew’s involvement, Epstein reached out to Andrew to ask how he was doing.\n \n\n   \n  “you ok?” Epstein wrote to an email identified as “The Duke,” an apparent reference to Andrew, known at the time as the Duke of York. “these stories are complete ant (sic) utter fantasy.”\n \n\n   \n  King Charles stripped Andrew of his prince title last month and forced him to move out of the royal residence. Andrew  relinquished his title  as Duke of York weeks beforehand.\n \n\n   \n    Jeffrey Epstein in 2018: ‘I know how dirty Donald is’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein wrote that, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the message on August 23, 2018, after Trump’s longtime fixer Michael Cohen  pleaded guilty  to federal campaign finances crimes. As part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors, Cohen  implicated Trump  in a 2016 hush-money scheme involving payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair, which Trump denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You see, I know how dirty Donald is,” Epstein wrote in the email. “My guess is that non-lawyers NY biz people have no idea what it means to have your fixer flip.”\n \n\n   \n  The email conversation began when Ruemmler sent Epstein a  New York Times column  about the Cohen guilty plea and what it might mean for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Her email said, “The principled case for impeachment is clear. What’s missing is the courage,” quoting the column.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was not impeached and he never faced any federal charges over the matter despite a  lengthy investigation . However, the Manhattan district attorney later won an indictment of Trump on state charges in connection with the matter.  Trump was convicted  last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payments.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein corresponded with Steve Bannon about then-Prince Andrew and Trump\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In early June 2019, President Trump made a state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was welcomed by the former Prince Andrew. A  photo shows Andrew grinning  as he shakes Trump’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  In a June 2019 email exchange with Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Jeffrey Epstein wrote, “prince andrew and trump today.. Tooo [sic] funny.” And then he added, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago [sic].”\n \n\n   \n  Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u [sic] the connective tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly Bannon meant by the message. Trump  fired him from the White House  in 2017, though Bannon remained influential in conservative politics as he does today.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Andrew  socialized together  in the 1990s and 2000s, per newspaper reports, alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sometimes at Mar-A-Lago. King Charles  stripped Andrew of his prince title  in October.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Bannon for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein said he ‘gave’ his young girlfriend to Trump in the 1990s. Trump has denied wrongdoing\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Aaron Blake \n \n\n   \n  Many of the exchanges from the emails feature people implying Epstein had damaging information about Trump and suggesting that he go public with it.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein generally didn’t engage with these suggestions. But at one point in late 2015, he told a New York Times reporter that he could produce “photos [sic] of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  Later in the same email string, Epstein also alluded to a woman he claimed both he and Trump had dated in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  “my 20 year old girlfriend in 1993, , that after two years i gave to donald,” Epstein said, linking to a webpage featuring the woman.\n \n\n   \n  A previously published lewd 2003 birthday album for Epstein’s 50th birthday alluded to a similar situation. It included a joke about Epstein having  sold “a ‘fully depreciated’ woman to Donald Trump.” \n \n\n   \n  Trump says the documents are a “hoax” and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/thailand-cambodia-border-clashes-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"1112-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Thailand-Cambodia peace agreement is falling apart after Cambodian villager killed in fresh clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by US President Donald Trump and signed in Kuala Lumpur in October 2025, is collapsing after a deadly clash on November 12, 2025, in a border village in Banteay Meanchey province.

Thailand-Cambodia peace agreement is falling apart after Cambodian villager killed in fresh clashes \n       \n  By Helen Regan, Kocha Olarn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:29 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump’s much-heralded peace declaration between Thailand and Cambodia is falling apart after the two countries accused each other of opening fire along their disputed border on Wednesday, in skirmishes that killed at least one person.\n \n\n   \n  The brief clash came two days after Thailand said it was  suspending a peace agreement  reached between the two Southeast Asian kingdoms, and presided over by Trump, after several Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion while on patrol in the border area Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia fought a  five-day border conflict  in July that killed dozens of people and displaced about 200,000 on both sides of the frontier. Trump had  hailed his intervention  in the dispute as further proof of his ability to end wars, and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n \n\n   \n  An initial ceasefire between the two sides was agreed on July 28 after the US president held calls with their respective leaders. Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Kuala Lumpur in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Thai soldiers opened fire on civilians in a border village in its northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, killing one person and wounding three others.\n \n\n   \n  The Thai military opened fire at 3:50 p.m. and again some two hours later, ministry spokesperson Lt Gen. Maly Socheata said in a statement.  Cambodia accused Thailand of carrying out “provocative actions over the past few days with the intention of inciting clashes,” in violation of the peace declaration.\n \n\n   \n  The same village, which both sides claim, was the site of a confrontation in September between Thai security personnel and Cambodian villagers. Thai police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to suppress protesters, according to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Contradicting the Cambodian version of events, a Thai army spokesperson said Cambodian troops had opened fire toward the Thai side in its eastern Sa Kaeo province at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thai troops took cover and fired warning shots toward the direction of the gunfire in accordance with the rules of engagement,” army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suwaree said.\n \n\n   \n  There were no Thai casualties or injuries and the incident lasted about 10 minutes, Winthai added.\n \n\n   \n  The clash came after Thailand on Monday said it was “halting all agreements” with Cambodia and would explain its decision to Washington after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand. Thailand accused Cambodia of planting fresh landmines, a claim the Cambodian government denied.\n \n\n   \n  Though Wednesday’s clash was brief, it marked a significant reignition of hostilities after Bangkok and Phnom Penh’s peace declaration that included commitments from both sides to de-escalate tensions, withdraw heavy weapons from the border, and conduct de-mining efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he “strongly condemns” the latest clash as an act against international law, and called for an independent investigation into the incident.\n \n\n   \n  “I call on the Thai side to immediately cease the use of force against innocent Cambodian civilians,” Hun Manet said in a Facebook post, adding that Cambodia remains committed to the ceasefire agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought over their disputed border for decades, but the fighting in July was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the border flare-up.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border, and the territorial dispute over demarcated portions of it largely stems from a map drawn up by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony, which Thailand does not accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/pakistan-powers-for-army-chief-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-05:00","title":"Pakistan Parliament Approves More Powers for Army Chief, Curbs Top Court","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan's parliament has passed a constitutional amendment on November 12, 2025, expanding the powers of Army Chief Asim Munir by elevating him to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all branches of the armed forces and lifelong legal immunity.

It opened when House Oversight Committee Democrats  released three emails  newly acquired from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump. This was soon followed by a torrent of other emails, some referencing the president, from the GOP-led panel.\n \n\n   \n  It did not immediately appear that the trove of material created any new legal issues for Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it proved “absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But the explosive content — which included Epstein and his now-jailed accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell discussing Trump — was the kind of gossipy jet fuel that can ensure scandals defy all attempts at containment and significantly worsened Trump’s political predicament on the issue. It was also the latest twist in a story with an extraordinary capacity to tarnish reputations, which, unlike its main protagonist, will not die.\n \n\n   \n  Political earthquakes are now rumbling on both sides of the Atlantic. Washington is on scandal alert. In the UK, the aftershocks just led to the  defenestration of a prince  — Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — and the  dismissal of a lord  as ambassador to Washington — Peter Mandelson — both over their past friendships with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Most seriously for the president, Wednesday’s disclosures raised questions over whether he’s been fully transparent about what he knew about Epstein — a former fellow New York and Florida resident, who killed himself in prison in 2019. At the least, the emails implied Trump knew more than he’s been prepared to let on about a wealthy convicted pedophile who moved in the highest society circles alongside powerful men in New York and London.\n \n\n   \n  In one email on April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight Committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. They accused Democrats of hiding her name because she did not allege Trump did something wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in an interview this year that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Other material was embarrassing for Trump. Epstein called him “borderline insane” in  a 2018 email exchange  with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. In another email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017, a week after Trump signed an executive order banning the entry of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, Epstein said, “Donald is f**king crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  A year later, Epstein wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about him, in an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Epstein also emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and Ruemmler in March 2018.\n \n\n   \n    An overbearing White House response makes the political drama worse\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein saga has dogged Trump for months. He’s tried and failed to shut it down, for instance when he lashed out in a Cabinet meeting in July, telling a reporter he didn’t know why people were still talking “about this guy, this creep.”\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the latest focus on the Epstein affair has underscored why the Justice Department makes it a practice not to release investigative files when prosecutions are not deemed appropriate. Disclosures can harm the reputations of those involved when they are not charged or accused of wrongdoing, or are merely witnesses who provided testimony or were mentioned in evidence.\n \n\n   \n  But incredibly, the latest political ramifications of the Epstein affair were triggered by administration officials themselves, with Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi pledging to release files before going back on their word. That has created the frenzy of speculation over what is contained in the full record of the case.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s left Trump accused of a classic Washington cover-up. As Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw put it in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. “It would make a lot more sense for him to just say, ‘Let’s release the full files and get it all out there and get it all over with.’”\n \n\n   \n  Walkinshaw went on: “Why doesn’t he want to do that? What’s in those files that he wants to allow this drip, drip, drip of bad news to continue?”\n \n\n   \n  Despite new denials of wrongdoing by Trump and his aides, Wednesday’s releases set off the latest overbearing, and frankly strange, effort by officials to quell the drama. In an extraordinary meeting exclusively reported by CNN, top officials met a single lawmaker, Rep. Lauren Boebert, in  the White House Situation Room , a venue fabled for its use in national security crises. Multiple sources said before the meeting that a heavyweight line-up of Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was expected.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting raised the question of whether the White House hoped to get the Colorado lawmaker to pull her name from a petition that will force GOP House leaders to  allow a vote  on releasing investigative files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Boebert later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  It was another stunning twist in a saga that makes the White House look not just clumsy but as if it is trying to orchestrate a cover-up, even as Trump’s aides insist there is nothing to hide.\n \n\n   \n  The Situation Room meeting was just the latest bizarre intervention by Trump’s aides in the Epstein case. In July, Blanche traveled to interview Maxwell, and the Justice Department later released the transcript and tape of her saying that the president had never at any time behaved inappropriately. Shortly afterward, Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, was moved to a far less draconian prison.\n \n\n   \n  Underlining the failure of the latest White House damage-control effort, GOP Rep. Nancy Mace confirmed to CNN’s Jake Tapper that she did not intend to try to remove her name from the discharge petition. “I will never turn my back on other survivors,” she wrote in a text message. “The work is too important. No one believes us. And we never get justice.” The petition got its pivotal signature on Wednesday with the  swearing-in of a newly elected Democratic lawmaker , which had been delayed for weeks by Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n    How can Trump tamp down the controversy?\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s drama was precipitated by the return of the House for the first time since mid-September. The immediate focus on Epstein seemed to reinforce a claim by Johnson’s critics that one of his aims in keeping lawmakers at home during the shutdown was to tamp down the Epstein storm. If that was the case, he only made it worse. The speaker had no choice but to announce that the House next week will vote, against the wishes of the White House, on a resolution requiring the Department of Justice to release files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  One question now is how on earth does Trump — whose  approval ratings  are already dipping fast, and who is struggling to empathize with a wave of economic anxiety rippling across the country — ever make all of this go away?\n \n\n   \n  Time and again, the president’s achievements have been overshadowed by the return of the Epstein case. While it is not clear that this is an issue that will decide many votes in the 2026 midterm elections, it’s a constant distraction for the White House. Questions about Trump’s character and past did not stop him twice winning the presidency. But the Epstein issue is a rare controversy that has caused a backlash with his base, even though there’s no sign yet that it will sever his almost mythical bond with his most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  But on this question, at least, he’s failed to pull the GOP into line. He made increasingly frantic efforts on social media to portray the email releases as all part of a Democratic plot. His efforts failed. Now, the number of Republican lawmakers who back the release of the documents will be closely watched.\n \n\n   \n  Any large-scale Republican revolt against the president in the House vote could be latest sign that his impregnable support from the GOP on Capitol Hill is beginning to crumble, following the failure of his demands on Republican senators to remove the filibuster rule in their chamber, which frustrated him during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And a strong vote from Republicans to release the files might also heap more pressure on Republicans in the Senate to vote for disclosure. “I’ve already had a couple Republicans tell my office privately that they’re going to vote for it, and I think that could snowball,” Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has braved fierce pressure from the White House, told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n \n\n   \n  In another sign of growing tensions in the House, another Republican, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee launched an unsuccessful bid to force the release of all the Epstein files immediately. “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” Burchett said.\n \n\n   \n  This was the latest indication, that, in Epstein’s words, the “dog that hasn’t barked” over his association with Trump is barking now. Everyone in Washington and around the globe can hear it. And ominously for Trump, the White House seems to have no idea how it can be silenced.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/china-iran-chemical-shipments-congress-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:17:00-04:00","title":"US Lawmakers Demand Answers from Trump Administration Over Chinese Chemical Shipments to Iran","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. lawmakers, including Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, have demanded answers from the Trump administration over reports that Chinese firms are supplying Iran with sodium perchlorate— a key precursor in ballistic missile propellants—since late September 2025.

The chemicals were bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers, the sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries, which analysts say could provide enough chemical for roughly 500 ballistic missiles, appear to show Iran is stepping up the rebuilding of its missile program, which was depleted by the conflict with Israel in June.\n \n\n   \n  They also come as there has been increased concern in Washington about  potential emerging coordination  between China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last month  for talks that resulted in an economic truce de-escalating their trade war.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s latest shipments of these critical chemical precursors indicate that US actions to date have failed to deter it from supporting Tehran’s procurement of offensive military capabilities,” Krishnamoorthi, who is the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, and Courtney, ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, wrote in their letter.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s support “not only increases Iran’s threat to its neighbors but also assists Russia and pro-Iranian proxy groups like the Houthis whose missile programs Iran has previously supported,” the Congressmen said.\n \n\n   \n  The shipments also “contravene sanctions the United Nations reinstated in September that prohibit international support for Iran’s ballistic missile program and development of nuclear weapons delivery systems,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  Krishnamoorthi and Courtney called for the Trump administration to explain what actions it was taking to “respond to the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) continuing support to Iran’s ballistic missile program,” including in coordination with US allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in April  announced  sanctions on a dozen entities and individuals based in Iran and China for their role procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions on Tehran were restored by a so-called snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms.\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n    China and Iran\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the UN sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue,” and may not see it bound by those rules, as such.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a question from CNN last month about the recent shipments, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while he “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporting last month followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew.\n \n\n   \n  Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had  previously been reported , and entities in China,  long a diplomatic and economic ally  of Iran, are also known to use a network of vessels to filter US-sanctioned Iranian oil to the country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/americas/venezuela-us-aircraft-carrier-reaction-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"21:05:00Z","title":"Venezuelans voice uncertainty, fear and skepticism after arrival of US aircraft carrier in region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the arrival of the US Navy’s USS Gerald R.

     11:16 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed a funding package to  reopen the federal government , officially bringing a close to the longest shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  The final approval came hours after the House voted 222 to 209 to pass a deal struck between Republicans and centrist Senate Democrats that keeps the government running through January and ensures some key agencies will be funded for the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement, which ended a record 43-day stalemate in Congress, will also reverse the mass federal layoffs carried out by Trump during the shutdown. It paves the way for paychecks to flow to government employees, as well as the resumption of critical food and nutrition services relied on by tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday night cast the legislation as a victory over Democrats, calling it “a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was, they tried to extort.”\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t want to do it the easy way,” he said from the Oval Office, attacking what he called “the extremists” in the Democratic Party. “They had to do it the hard way, and they look very bad.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House signing ceremony was attended by a range of Republican lawmakers and capped a four-day sprint to pass the funding bill, after eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to compromise with Republicans amid worries about the shutdown’s widening economic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  The deal guarantees an early December vote in the Senate on the expiring Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made the focus of their demands during the shutdown fight. But a vote to extend the subsidies is unlikely to succeed, a likelihood that’s driven intense blowback across the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  Most congressional Democrats loudly protested the bill in the run-up to Wednesday’s vote over concerns Americans’ health care premiums will skyrocket without the subsidies, with only six House Democrats voting in favor of the package.\n \n\n   \n  “This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote. “Tens of millions of Americans are at risk of being unable to afford to go see a doctor when they need it.”\n \n\n   \n  Back in Washington for the first time since mid-September, Speaker Mike Johnson corralled almost all Republicans behind the bill, despite sharp complaints from some of his members over a contentious provision added by Senate Republicans that allowed senators to retroactively sue the Department of Justice for obtaining phone records during a Biden-era probe – potentially amounting to a major financial windfall for those lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson himself said he was blindsided by the language, and he said he didn’t know about it until the Senate had already passed the package.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked by it, I was angry about it,” the speaker said, though he added that he did not believe Senate Majority Leader John Thune added it in a nefarious manner. “I think it was a really bad look, and we’re going to fix it in the House.”\n \n\n   \n  To win over conservative holdouts, Johnson vowed that the House would take a future vote to strip that language — though it’s unclear if the Senate would take it up. Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas ultimately agreed not to amend the language in the current stopgap bill, since it would require the Senate to return to Washington to vote again and delay the end of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Conservatives like Roy had blasted that provision as “self-dealing,” since it would award senators $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their lawsuit is successful. The amendment appeared to benefit eight senators in particular who had been subpoenaed by the previous administration into investigations into Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, accused those eight senators of voting “to shove taxpayer dollars into their own pockets – $500,000 for each time their records were inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  The House Democrats who voted in favor of the compromise bill to reopen the government were: Reps. Jared Golden, Adam Gray, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Henry Cuellar, Tom Suozzi and Don Davis. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie voted and Greg Steube against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The end of the government shutdown will usher in a frenetic few weeks of work for the House, which has been largely shuttered since late September. As part of the GOP’s pressure campaign on Democrats, Johnson had decided to keep all members out of Washington until Senate Democrats agreed to back the GOP’s existing funding plan.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Republicans and Democrats have just four weeks in session before the end of the year — when those Obamacare tax credits expire. Trump has called for revamping the law rather than extending the existing subsidies, setting up a high-stakes showdown over health care that could carry political ramifications for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Obamacare was a disaster,” Trump said Wednesday night. “We’ll work on something having to do with health care. We can do a lot better.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are plenty of other deadlines, including Congress’ farm bill and a slew of expiring energy credits. \n \n\n   \n  House Republicans are also eager to pass as many spending bills as possible to improve their negotiating stance with the Senate ahead of that next deadline on January 30.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson also faces another hot-button issue: the question of how Congress should handle the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  Not long before the votes to reopen the government got underway, a newly elected Democrat — Rep. Adelita Grijalva — became the critical 218th signature to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release all of its case files related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson announced to reporters soon after Grijalva signed the petition that he will put a bill compelling the Department of Justice to release all of its Epstein case files on the House floor next week – earlier than expected, and after an extraordinary White House pressure campaign earlier Wednesday failed to convince any Republicans to remove their name from the petition.\n \n\n   \n  The effort coincided with intensifying scrutiny over the Epstein files in the House. Earlier Wednesday, House Democrats on the Oversight panel released  new emails that  showed Epstein had repeatedly mentioned Trump by name in private correspondence, and then the GOP-led committee released 200,000 pages of documents the panel received from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/australia-ancient-crocodile-hunting-trees-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00.000Z","title":"Ancient eggshells shed new light on crocodiles that hunted prey from trees","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have discovered Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, belonging to mekosuchine crocodiles that lived 55 million years ago.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have unearthed Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, a discovery that could shed light on ancient reptiles that may have hunted prey by dropping on them from trees.\n \n\n   \n  The eggshells belonged to mekosuchine crocodiles, a prehistoric creature that dominated Australian waters 55 million years ago — a long time before the arrival of saltwater and freshwater crocs on the continent around 3.8 million years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Paleontologist Michael Archer said mekosuchine crocodiles could grow to at least 5 meters (around 16 feet) long, and some hunted from trees. Australian researchers have dubbed them “drop crocs,” a reference to the feared “drop bear” — the vicious, carnivorous cousin of the country’s beloved koalas,  or so the legend goes .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a bizarre idea. But some of them appear to have been terrestrial hunters in the forests,” said Archer, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who took part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “They were perhaps hunting like leopards — dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner,” ﻿he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A team of international scientists, led by Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont   in Barcelona, dug up the fossils from a rancher’s backyard in southeast Queensland and studied them .  They reported their findings Tuesday in the  Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .\n \n\n   \n  The ancient crocodile eggshells are helping scientists to understand the anatomy of these reptiles, as well as their reproduction patterns and adaptability, the study’s lead author, Xavier Panadès i Blas, said.\n \n\n   \n  “They preserve microstructural and geochemical signals that tell us not only what kinds of animals laid them, but also where they nested and how they bred,” he said   in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mekosuchine crocs are believed to have become extinct in Australia around 3,000 years ago. They may have lost much of their inland habitat due to encroaching dryland, a situation compounded by growing competition with other predators and the dwindling amount of prey, said co-author Michael Stein, a research associate at the University of New South Wales.\n \n\n   \n    A backyard trove\n \n\n   \n  The exact location of the discovery is a small town called Murgon, about three and a half hours’ drive from Brisbane, the capital of Queensland.\n \n\n   \n  Archer said he and his colleagues had been excavating there since 1983, and he could still recall how it all began.\n \n\n   \n  “UNSW colleague Henk Godhelp and I drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The residents “grinned and said ‘of course’” after hearing their homes were sitting on some prehistoric treasures, Archer recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we’ve already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s inherently difficult to identify an extinct species based on   an eggshell, said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist and author of “ The Secret Lives of Dinosaurs  — Unearthing the  Real  Behaviors of Prehistoric Animals.” He wasn’t involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, given that the eggshell was found in the same geological deposits and locality of the only known mekosuchine fossils from that period of time, Lomax said the authors made a solid argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of the key things here is that matching the fossil egg shells and the croc that laid them can provide new information,” he said. “It will help us to understand not only how they reproduced and where they laid their eggs, but the connection may help shed light on the lifestyle of these unusual crocs.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"Johnson says House will vote next week on push to compel DOJ to release all of its Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the House will vote next week on a bill to compel the Justice Department to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files, a move accelerated by a discharge petition from Reps.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson announced Wednesday that he would put a ﻿contentious bill compelling the release of all of the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein case files to a vote on the House floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said, adding, “in the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson was required to soon put the bill from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, on the floor after the pair  successfully deployed an arcane tool  in the chamber known as a discharge petition. But he had some leeway to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leaders’ suggestion that he would move more quickly than expected to put the bill before the full House is a reflection of the growing sense of agitation among members of his party on Capitol Hill. The House GOP – which is fiercely loyal to Trump – is not eager to take the vote, which goes against the president’s own wishes. But many members of the party are also sick of the months of growing pressure from some vocal members of their own party, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and feel they need to vote in favor of releasing the files or risk being accused of protecting pedophiles.\n \n\n   \n  “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” a frustrated Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters after he went rogue earlier in the day, taking to the House floor to try to force an expedited vote on the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m tired of messing around. The Democrats have had the Epstein files for four years, and now we’ve got it for nine months, and it’s going to be dragged into a bunch of nonsense. Let’s just take it to the floor. Let’s vote on it. Let’s get on with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The congressman’s push was denied because it did not follow the proper parliamentary procedure.\n \n\n   \n  Political pressure over that high-profile Epstein vote roared back to life on the Hill Wednesday, with House members return to Washington after more than a month away.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva’s afternoon swearing in as the House’s newest member delivered the decisive vote to the discharge petition to force a vote, despite GOP leadership’s opposition and an apparent eleventh-hour  pressure campaign  by the White House to avoid it altogether.\n \n\n   \n  As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up on the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require. But Massie and Khanna used the discharge petition because House GOP leadership did not want the bill to get a vote – leaving many expecting they would have to wait seven legislative days to circumvent leadership and come to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  While the floor schedule for next week has not yet been set, Johnson said leadership wants to bring up the measure “as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it. I mean, they have 218 signatures, that’s fine, we’ll do it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The House Committee on Oversight Committee on Wednesday released an additional 20,000 pages of documents the GOP-led panel had received from the late convicted sex offender’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In emails released as part of the tranche, Epstein, whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence over the last 15 years with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit – details seized on by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, however, brushed aside the  newly public details  when asked about them earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a massive distraction by the Democrats while we’re trying to get the government reopened and cover for their mistakes. I find it interesting that the press corps didn’t ask all these questions for four years during the Biden administration,” Johnson said, when asked whether he had any concerns about the new findings.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed by CNN why Congress shouldn’t release all Epstein documents when the president himself has said he supports doing so, Johnson said: “He is for maximum transparency. He said it as recently as a couple of days ago, and I talked to him about it today. He’s for everything coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Epstein-related pressure builds, two more House Republicans — GOP Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Eli Crane of Arizona — said they plan to vote for the bill to release the files when it comes to the floor. Neither had signed the discharge petition.\n \n\n   \n  Other Republicans, however, remain staunchly opposed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a vote against,” Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “My understanding and I’ve looked into it extensively is that the president didn’t like that guy, he had no friendly relationships with him.

   9:03 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal government shutdown provided  President Donald Trump  a weekslong reprieve from major revelations about his relationship with  Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  But as Congress looks to reopen the government this week, it’s clear Trump’s Epstein problem hasn’t gone away.\n \n\n   \n  The big news Wednesday morning was that House Oversight Committee Democrats released  three emails obtained from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump . Those emails came amid another huge release from the GOP-led committee of Epstein documents that  CNN is still reviewing .\n \n\n   \n  In one 2011 email, Epstein describes Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” He writes that someone who Democrats identify as an Epstein victim (but whose name is redacted in the released email) “spent hours at my house with him,” apparently referring to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans on the committee have since said the redacted victim who supposedly spent time with Trump  is Virginia Giuffre , one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. (Giuffre never implicated Trump in any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2019 email, Epstein appears to reflect on Trump asking Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to stop recruiting employees from Mar-a-Lago. In the email, Epstein says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2015 email, Epstein writes to author Michael Wolff about how Trump might handle questions about his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  (You can  see the emails for yourself here .)\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The White House on Wednesday said the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But what do these emails add to our understanding of their past relationship? Let’s break it down.\n \n\n   \n    Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and when\n \n\n   \n  There have remained huge unanswered questions about  what Trump knew and when about Epstein’s proclivities . That’s especially given Trump’s explanations have often  proved evasive or false .\n \n\n   \n  The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had “selectively leaked” the emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.\n \n\n   \n  To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein  liked women “on the younger side.”  A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein “ going after younger girls ” at a 1992 “calendar girl” event. Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein’s “swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls” and joking that it was nice of Epstein to “ let the neighborhood kids use his pool .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a “creep” — but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees, including Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago — but he seemed to be  quite reluctant to go into detail .\n \n\n   \n  The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being  recruited for .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he didn’t “know really why” Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation — and was aware of Epstein’s taste for young females — that would seem to raise red flags.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal actions,” Giuffre’s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in  a statement  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre “spent hours” at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell’s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn’t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein’s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump’s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s clear from Giuffre’s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends. “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,” Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses “next to the resort” who needed babysitting for their kids.\n \n\n   \n    The emails undercut Maxwell’s attempts to distance Trump from Epstein\n \n\n   \n  The Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so  despite  her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.\n \n\n   \n  (Trump at the time hadn’t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn’t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn’t explained how this happened, months later.)\n \n\n   \n  And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president.  She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But the new emails call her claims into question.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of Trump’s and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: “I don’t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of — I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.”\n \n\n   \n  But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein’s house, at least as of 2011.\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending “hours at my house” with Trump, Maxwell responds, “I have been thinking about that.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been  called into question .\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significant\n \n\n   \n  We surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There’s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  The timelines are important here.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein’s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently  stripped of his noble title .) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein  seemed to be going into legal attack mode .\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein’s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, Epstein described Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” This is an expression that comes from   Sherlock Holmes mysteries ; it basically means the absence of an expected event.\n \n\n   \n  Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected  news about Trump to have come out?\n \n\n   \n  (Years later, in June 2019, Epstein seemed willing to laugh about it in an email exchange with a redacted individual, who a source confirmed is Trump’s former White House strategist Steve Bannon. Epstein described a meeting between then-President Trump and Prince Andrew at a state visit as “Tooo funny,” adding, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago.” Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u the connective tissue.“)\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of the 2019 email about Trump and Maxwell is also relevant. That’s because it came during Trump’s first term as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump’s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ’s inspector general  said on January 30  of that year that he didn’t have the power to examine the situation. But  by February 6  the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors  as of early that year .\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump “of course” being aware of Maxwell’s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategize about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)\n \n\n   \n  In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to “let him hang himself” by denying being on Epstein’s plane or his house.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I know how dirty Donald is’: Several suggestions about what Epstein knew about Trump\n \n\n   \n  The newly released documents don’t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump’s possible impeachment: “you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.” (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about “the stories you could tell,” according to one of the released email exchanges. After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was “a phony rich person.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos “of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  He also told the person that he at one point “gave” his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.\n \n\n   \n  At other points in Epstein’s correspondence, Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,” Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. “Interested?”\n \n\n   \n    Trump is still feeding perceptions of a cover-up\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s reactions to the new documents Wednesday aren’t going to do anything to tamp down perceptions that Trump is trying to keep stuff like this hidden.\n \n\n   \n  CNN exclusively  reported  that the White House held a Situation Room meeting Wednesday with a key GOP lawmaker who’s signed onto an effort to force a House vote on releasing the full Epstein files, using what’s known as a  discharge petition  – something the White House wants to stop.\n \n\n   \n  That petition got a decisive 218th signature Wednesday from a new Democratic member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP lawmaker, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, later thanked White House officials for meeting with her in a post on X, writing, “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is also reporting Trump has  played phone tag  with another of the four Republican signatories, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. (She later said in a statement, “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”)\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s response to Oversight Democrats releasing emails that mention him was to publicly pressure Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap” on Epstein, Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else …”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional takeaways.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress is passing a compromise bill to end a prolonged federal government shutdown by providing funding for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026, while excluding full-year funding for all agencies.

reopen the federal government? \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Congress is  moving quickly  to pass a funding package that would end the longest federal shutdown in the nation’s history.\n \n\n   \n  The House is set to vote on Wednesday on a compromise bill after the  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the legislation extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement with Republicans does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the bill, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The bill would provide funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions would continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The legislation would fully fund the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The deal would also replenish SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund would also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year.

What happens next? \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Adelita Grijalva’s swearing in on Wednesday made her Democrats’ newest member in the US House of Representatives and officially set in motion lawmakers’ effort to force a vote on a measure the White House has fought for months: a bill to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n  After her formal swearing in, Grijalva provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  As a refresher, a discharge petition is a critical tool at rank-and-file members’ disposal. Under the arcane procedure, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign one, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joined with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to spearhead this particular discharge petition, but while Grijalva provided the decisive signature, the effort faces a number of hurdles — and the bill is unlikely to become law.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, should it pass the House, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump, who has derided the effort. But the House vote would put lawmakers on the record on the issue, forcing Republicans in particular to choose between siding with Trump or backing the release of files that could shine new light on the crimes of the convicted sex offender.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the steps the House will have to take now that Grijalva has become the 218th signature:\n \n\n   \n    How long does it take to ‘ripen’?\n \n\n   \n  Even with Grijalva’s signature, an additional seven legislative days have to lapse before a member can move to bring the petition to the floor. The week is often referred to as the “ripening” period.\n \n\n   \n  Then, House Speaker Mike Johnson has up to two legislative days to schedule a vote. (But again, calendar days don’t always equal legislative days – the House must be in session.)\n \n\n   \n  That appeared to make the first week of December the earliest the House could actually begin considering a vote to release the Epstein files on the House floor. But in a surprise, Johnson said early Wednesday evening he’d put the measure on the floor next week. As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up to the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n    Can GOP leadership delay or dodge the effort?\n \n\n   \n  If he wanted to, Johnson does have a few maneuvers at his disposal to try to delay or derail the process, including an attempt to table a final vote on the matter or referring it to a committee. But Johnson’s saying the bill will come to the floor next week shows that he wants to bring this up for a vote.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker has previously indicated that if the petition gets 218 signatures, he will allow for a vote. “If they get their signatures, it goes to a vote,” Johnson told reporters last month.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson also called the effort a “moot point” on CNN earlier this week, citing the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein-related investigation and release of thousands of pages of documents.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming the process moves forward, the House would then have to take a series of procedural votes with hours of debate on the House floor before the bill would receive a final vote.\n \n\n   \n  And then, after all that, the bill would still need to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate – a dubious prospect – where 60 votes would be needed for it to advance, if it even got a vote.\n \n\n   \n    Will the Senate consider the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Even if Massie’s bill clears the House, there’s no guarantee it would get a vote in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether the Senate should vote on the bill, the Republican leader said he was “not sure what that achieves.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to force a vote in September on a bill calling for the release of the files, but Senate Republicans killed the measure — with all but two Republicans voting to derail it.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/adejlita-grijalva-swearing-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:50:00Z","title":"Rep.

Adelita Grijalva was sworn into Congress Wednesday, bringing an end to a contentious chapter in the US House of Representatives that included a  lawsuit  and  rising tensions inside the Capitol  over her seating.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson  had said  he would not swear in the Arizona Democrat amid the government shutdown until the House returned to legislative session, a delay that prompted outrage from Democrats. The swearing in took place after the chamber reconvened to vote on a Senate-passed bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Shaking her hand on Wednesday, Johnson described the disagreement over the delay in swearing Grijalva in as “some intense fellowship.”\n \n\n   \n  While she waited to be sworn in, Grijalva had been unable to perform basic constituent services or even open an office in her southern Arizona district. Previously describing herself as a “tourist with an office,” she told CNN that up until Wednesday she hasn’t had a working office phone, an office budget or the ability to use government systems. Residents of the sprawling district had been without a vote in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva was sworn in on the House floor to a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona’s 7th Congressional District elected me to represent them,” Grijalva said on Wednesday. “This is an abuse of power. One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing in of a duly elected member of Congress for a political reason.”\n \n\n   \n  Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva become the decisive 218th member in support of an effort to force the House to vote on the release of all of the Jeffrey Epstein case files, an issue that has roiled the House and sparked division among Republicans. Hours before her signature advanced the effort forward, top Trump administration officials  met with  at least one Republican who had also signed onto the petition.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors were in the gallery to watch Grijalva be sworn in.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we the American people,” Grijalva said. “That is why I will discharge petition right now to release the Epstein files. Justice cannot wait another day.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued that Johnson delayed swearing Grijalva in because she would be the deciding signature that would trigger the floor vote and pointed to other instances where Johnson moved quickly to swear in Republicans who won their special elections. Johnson said Wednesday he’d put the measure requiring Congress to release the Epstein files on the floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that’s different about me and the three other people that this speaker swore in in under 24 hours from the date of their elections is I’m the 218th signer,” Grijalva told CNN last month.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has defended his decision to delay Grijalva’s swearing by arguing that she won her race on September 23 when the House was already out of session and had vowed to swear her in as soon as the House returned.\n \n\n   \n  “I really like this lady. She is going to be an excellent member of Congress. She is a great person,” Johnson told Grijalva on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “She may not agree with me, but we followed the custom of the House on the timetable,” the speaker added. “I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn’t missed a vote and we’re delighted you’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  The House has been out of session since September 19, as Johnson put pressure on Senate Democrats to compromise with Republicans and vote to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown dragged on, the pressure on Johnson to swear in Grijalva mounted. Arizona’s Democratic senators got into a hallway confrontation with Johnson over the issue and other Democrats staged protests outside of the speaker’s office. Arizona’s attorney general even  sued  the House of Representatives over the delay, a move that Johnson  dismissed  as “patently absurd” and a bid for publicity.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva filled the seat vacated by her father, the  late Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva , who represented the district in Congress for more than two decades before  he died  after a battle with cancer in March. Running on the strength of her family name, she sailed to victory in the Democratic primary this summer and then defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the special election, capturing roughly 70% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson complimented Grijalva’s late father and reflected on his time working with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I just told her on the way in that she fills her father’s shoes, or she is going to try, no one can. He was giant around here, served a long time, served his state very well. I served under him on the Natural Resources Committee for awhile, admired the way he did the work, he was tenacious. So, she has a proud family legacy, and we’re delighted to have her here,” Johnson said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  When asked on Wednesday, why it took so long for her to be sworn in, Grijalva said, motioning toward Johnson, “that would not be my question.”\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva has been frustrated by the delay in her swearing in and has said the hardest part about delaying her swearing in was being unable to help her constituents during the longest government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve really missed the opportunity to be able to help constituents that are here that need services. So it’s been very difficult to sit it out while people come up to me and ask me for help,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-administration-meeting-house-effort-epstein-document-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:02:00-05:00","title":"Exclusive: Trump administration holds Situation Room meeting over House effort to force release of all of DOJ’s Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Top Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel, met in a Situation Room with Republican Representative Lauren Boebert to discuss a House effort to force the release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Lauren Boebert.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that show the level of transparency when we are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns?” she told reporters at the press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt added: “I’m not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar confirmed the meeting in the Situation Room included Boebert, who has wanted the Justice Department to release its trove of Epstein files and has signed onto the effort in the House to force the vote compelling their release.\n \n\n   \n  That effort is now in motion after a newly sworn-in Democratic member of Congress provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  After the meeting, Boebert wrote on X, “I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  She later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, President Donald Trump and Rep. Nancy Mace, another Republican who’s signed the petition, had been playing phone tag for the past 24 hours. The South Carolina Republican sent a direct message to the president Wednesday outlining why she’s supporting the discharge petition, according to a source familiar with the message who said it largely mirrored a public statement in which she said: “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”\n \n\n   \n  But both the meeting and Trump’s efforts to talk to Mace underscored the administration’s concerns around the Epstein saga, which roared back Wednesday morning when the House Oversight Committee released more documents it had obtained from Epstein’s estate. (Leavitt said Wednesday the emails from that trove that mention Trump  “prove absolutely nothing.” )\n \n\n   \n  Besides Boebert and Mace, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is the other Republican who’s signed onto the petition from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, to force the vote on the release of the files on the House floor. The pair received the 218th decisive signature from Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva Wednesday afternoon,  allowing the push to force a vote to move forward. \n \n\n   \n  Had anyone removed their name from the petition before reaching 218, Massie and Khanna would have no longer had the support needed to move forward.\n \n\n   \n  Under the arcane procedure of a House discharge petition, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign on, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  The unreleased Justice Department files, which capture years of investigation into child sex trafficking, could include details the House hasn’t obtained.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the White House meeting, one source said it would also include Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi was seen leaving the White House at 1:10pm ET on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The controversy around Epstein and his contacts with other powerful people, including Trump, has divided the Republican Party in recent months, with Boebert being among the Republican House members publicly pushing for more transparency around the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any crime, and longtime Epstein contact and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell previously told Blanche in an interview this summer that she had seen no wrongdoing,  including by Trump.  \n \n\n   \n  At least two women who say they are survivors of Epstein’s abuse were expected to attend Grijalva’s swearing-in ceremony Wednesday afternoon, sources with knowledge told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The House effort to compel the release of the files, should it pass, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by Trump, who has derided the effort.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melissa-hortman-death-vance-boelter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00-05:00","title":"Prosecutors turn over 130,000 pages of evidence in the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile case involving the June 14, 2025, killings of Minnesota lawmakers Melissa and Mark Hortman and John and Yvette Hoffman, Vance Boelter, a 58-year-old politically conservative evangelical, was charged with murder and attempted murder.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling  Thursday limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Thursday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/louisville-ups-plane-crash-victims","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"All 14 Victims Identified from Fiery UPS Cargo Plane Crash in Louisville","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports the identification of all 14 victims in a deadly UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville, which occurred during takeoff from Muhammad Ali International Airport.

Gavin Newsom  has been indicted on federal charges alleging her involvement in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra.\n \n\n   \n  Dana Williamson was arrested and scheduled to make her first court appearance Wednesday in Sacramento. It was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n \n\n   \n  The federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson was part of a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra’s chief of staff at the time of the alleged conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Becerra is a former California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra’s dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra’s campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie’s wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n \n\n   \n  When Williamson prepared to join Newsom’s office in late 2022, she arranged for “Co-Conspirator 2” — an unnamed former public official — to take over her role in the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson told the Los Angeles Times that year that she planned to sever financial ties to her company while working for the governor. However the indictment includes details of emails, calls, and meetings between her and McCluskie regarding the alleged scheme and cover-up while she was Newsom’s chief of staff, a position she held until late 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the Covid-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n \n\n   \n  McCluskie signed a plea deal October 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: “Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”\n \n\n   \n  Becerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson faces 23 charges, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the US Attorney’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra’s campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom’s chief of staff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/state-department-warning-japan-bears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:22:00-05:00","title":"US State Department Warns Americans in Japan: Watch Out for Bears","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US State Department issued a rare wildlife advisory to American citizens in northern Japan, warning of increased bear sightings and attacks, especially in areas near populated zones such as Sapporo and Akita Prefecture.

Watch out for bears \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:22 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US State Department on Wednesday  issued an unusual warning  to Americans in northern Japan: watch out for bears.\n \n\n   \n  The “wildlife alert” advised that “bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.”\n \n\n   \n  As  CNN reported last week , there has been a sharp uptick in bear attacks in Japan this year. At least 13 people have been killed and more than 100 injured since April this year, according to government figures – some of the highest numbers since records began in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  In the alert issued Wednesday, the US diplomatic mission in Japan noted that a park in Sapporo, which is located next to the US consulate, had been closed for two weeks following a bear sighting.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings,” the alert said. “Bears have also been spotted in other residential areas in Hokkaido and Akita prefectures.”\n \n\n   \n  “Authorities will generally close areas like parks if a bear has been sighted in the area,” it said, advising Americans not to walk alone in areas where bears have been seen.\n \n\n   \n  In Akita, local authorities have sought the help of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in combating the wild threat.

Adelita Grijalva was  sworn in as the newest member of the House  after a weeks-long delay.\n \n\n   \n  The swearing in came ahead of a critical vote in the chamber to pass a Senate-approved bill to reopen the federal government and put an end to the longest shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats still vacant. Speaker Mike Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote.\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona Democrat’s swearing will pave the way for a highly anticipated vote to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Grijalva is expected to deliver the decisive signature on a petition from GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to force  a House vote  on the release of files related to the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had refused to call the House back into session or swear in Grijalva for weeks amid the government shutdown following her special election win at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker had indicated he would call the House back into session and swear in Grijalva once the Senate passed a bill to reopen the government – which they did earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  One of the vacant House seats, in Tennessee, leans Republican and will be filled by a special election next month. The other vacancy is in Texas where two Democrats have advanced to a runoff. That has not been yet scheduled but will be held early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-trump-emails-oversight-committee","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"Epstein Mentioned Trump Multiple Times in Private Emails, New Release Shows","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly released private emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee through a subpoena, reveal that Epstein mentioned Donald Trump multiple times, describing Trump as having spent time at his house and knowing about the victims of Epstein’s trafficking operations.

The emails also include a message in which Epstein asserts Trump “knew about the girls” — seemingly in reference to Trump’s  claim that he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club  for poaching young women who worked there, according to the newly released emails.\n \n\n   \n  The emails were released Wednesday morning by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which obtained them after  subpoenaing Epstein’s estate earlier this year , hours before the GOP-led panel released thousands more documents from the estate. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predated his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and the White House on Wednesday cast the issue as a “hoax” with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, Giuffre writes that her father, who was maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, got her a job as a locker room attendant. She wrote: “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. ‘Do you like kids?’ he asked. ‘Do you babysit at all?’ He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends, many of whom had children who needed tending.”\n \n\n   \n  She does not accuse Trump of wrongdoing in the book, “Nobody’s Girl.”\n \n\n   \n  About three years before the email – in June 2008 – Epstein had been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison after pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was released from prison in July 2009, having served just 13 months. Years later, his plea deal would face media scrutiny, including from the Miami Herald, and face widespread  criticism as being too lenient .\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in  an interview earlier this year  that she “never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings.\n \n\n   \n  “The President was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny amid a political firestorm in Washington over whether and when the federal government will release its files on the late sex trafficker who  died in prison in 2019 . The  controversy heated up earlier this year  when Trump’s own Justice Department declared that it  stood by its previous conclusion that Epstein died by suicide  and that it did not plan to provide any more information on the case.\n \n\n   \n  That sparked an outcry in Congress and among  some members of Trump’s own MAGA base , and it breathed life into efforts to pry loose new information. The House Oversight Committee successfully sought materials from the estate, and there is a separate effort underway in Congress to force a vote on compelling the release of more files from the US government. That effort received a critical, 218th supporter when  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  signed the discharge petition after being sworn in Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Wednesday criticized Democrats on the House Oversight Committee for releasing the messages, claiming the members “selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump’s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump echoed those criticisms in a series of Truth Social posts Wednesday afternoon, accusing of Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” and issuing a warning to Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” he added, as several GOP lawmakers have signed onto the House push to force a vote compelling the release of the Justice Department’s files related to Epstein. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term and about seven months before Epstein died by suicide in prison.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In her interview with Blanche, Maxwell denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the US president has denied any wrongdoing. He  filed a libel lawsuit  against the publisher of the Wall Street Journal and reporters who wrote  a story  about a  collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003 , including a note bearing Trump’s name and an outline of a naked woman.\n \n\n   \n  In a third email released by the Oversight committee and viewed by CNN Wednesday, Wolff — who published a book on Trump’s West Wing in 2018 — wrote Epstein with the subject line “heads up” on December 15, 2015. That was the day of a CNN Republican primary debate, but there is no mention of Epstein in the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you–either on air or in scrum afterwards,” Wolff reportedly wrote to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein, according to the email, responded, “if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff answered, “I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff has indicated publicly that he has interviewed Epstein, and The Daily Beast has reported it obtained recordings in which Epstein spoke at length to the author about Trump and claimed the two were close friends. Trump’s camp has called the recordings “false smears,” according to  the Daily Beast .\n \n\n   \n  Following the House Oversight Democrats’ release of the emails with Wolff and Maxwell, the GOP-led panel released an additional 20,000 pages it had received from Epstein’s estate, including messages where Epstein criticized his onetime friend after Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald is f**king crazy,” Epstein wrote in one January 2017 email to a New York Times reporter, one week after Trump’s inauguration. In another December 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, he called the president “borderline insane.” That same month he emailed former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior.\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power,” he wrote. “tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler, who did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, and Epstein were corresponding at the time. But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/uk/british-police-maga-influencer-incident-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00-05:00","title":"British Police Want to Speak to MAGA Influencer and Partner After London Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British police have released an appeal for information following a racially aggravated incident at Bond Street Tube Station in central London on October 11, 2025, where a woman was subjected to racial abuse and an illegal use of pepper spray by a man and woman who were walking ahead of her family.

‘certain talents’ to fill jobs domestically \n       \n  By Donald Judd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:27 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  told Fox News in an interview that aired Tuesday night the United States doesn’t have workers with “certain talents” to fill jobs needed domestically, defending the  H1-B skilled worker visa program. \n \n\n   \n  Pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether his administration would  reduce H1-B visas  over concerns it would depress wages for American workers, Trump told Ingraham, “I agree — but you also do have to bring in talent.”\n \n\n   \n  When the Fox host responded, “We have plenty of talented people here,” Trump replied, “No, you don’t, no you don’t … you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory where we’re going to make missiles.’”\n \n\n   \n  The president pointed to the  September ICE raid of a Georgia Hyundai facility , which saw authorities arrest and deport hundreds of South Korean contractors over their immigration status, as evidence of the country’s need for skilled foreign workers.\n \n\n   \n  “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments come just two weeks after he told reporters traveling with him to South Korea that he was   “very much opposed” to the raid  carried out by federal officers as part of his administration’s immigration crackdown at US worksites.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signed an executive action in September to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas. The move marked the latest in a series of efforts from the administration to crack down on immigration and place sharp new limits on the types of foreigners allowed into the country.\n \n\n   \n  The H-1B visa is a work visa that’s valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments during the interview drew criticism Wednesday from Republican Congresswoman — and Trump ally — Marjorie Taylor Greene, who  took to social media  to write, “I believe in the American people. I am one of you.”\n \n\n   \n  “I believe you are good, talented, creative, intelligent, hard working, and want to achieve,” Greene said on X. “I am solidly against you being replaced by foreign labor, like with H1Bs.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia congresswoman has been a fierce backer of Trump since being elected to the House in 2020, but has broken with her party in recent weeks over health care and Trump’s focus on international relations, which she’s said has come at the expense of domestic issues.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fired back at Greene’s criticisms in remarks from the Oval Office Monday, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins she’s “lost her way,” and is now “catering to the other side.”\n \n\n   \n  In the first part of the Fox News interview that aired Monday, Trump  took a swipe at the nation of France  while defending the enrollment of Chinese students at universities in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually think it’s good to have outside countries,” the president said when asked about enrolling Chinese nationals at American universities.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not the French. They’re the Chinese. They spy on us. They steal our intellectual property,” Ingraham responded.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you think the French are better?” Trump said. Ingraham replied, “Yeah,” to which the president said, “I’m not so sure.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melodee-buzzard-disappearance-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"A timeline of 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melodee Buzzard, a 9-year-old girl from Lompoc, California, disappeared on October 7, 2025, after her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, took her on a 1,000-mile road trip across multiple states.

investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focused on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska, and has led to the arrest of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard, on an unrelated charge.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard pleaded not guilty to a false imprisonment charge in court Wednesday and was ordered to be released with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 10 , the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Mother arrested on false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard faces a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She was being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/devil-wears-prada-2-teaser","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:13:00Z","title":"Meryl Streep Reunites with Anne Hathaway in ‘The Devil Wears Prada 2’ Teaser: ‘Took you long enough’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'The Devil Wears Prada 2' reveals a reunion of Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs, echoing the original film's dynamic.

12:31 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom pulled no punches at the COP30 climate talks in Brazil on Tuesday, calling President Donald Trump an “invasive species” and a “wrecking ball” during discussions about the US  absence from global climate action .\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, a Democrat widely viewed as a likely presidential candidate in 2028, is the most high-profile US political figure attending the talks in the Amazon city of Belém. The Trump administration made the unprecedented decision not to send a high-level delegation to the annual talks — the latest move in its sharp pull away from global climate action.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has spent the past year tearing up climate policies, seeking to  strangle clean energy projects , pushing other countries to buy US oil and gas and  withdrawing the US  from the Paris climate agreement. In a speech at the United Nations in September, Trump called climate change a “con job.”   \n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has a history of sparring with Trump, appears to be using COP30 as an opportunity to set out a different vision for US climate action. “I do not want the United States of America to be a footnote on climate policy,” he said at an event Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  He took sharp, personal aim at Trump for abandoning efforts to tackle the climate crisis. “He’s an invasive species. He is. He’s a wrecking ball president. And he’s trying to roll back progress of the last century … he’s doubling down on stupid,” Newsom   said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s stance is handing victory to China, he added. China is dominating clean energy supply chains and manufacturing “because they understand the great economic opportunity,” Newsom said.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom was also asked about the Trump administration’s reported plan to open the California coast to oil and gas drilling, as  reported  in The Washington Post yesterday based on a leaked draft map.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never going to happen. Over our dead body. Dead on arrival. Period. Full stop,” Newsom said. He asked the audience to consider why Trump might be targeting California. “He has no interest in opening up oil drilling rigs right off the coast of Florida, across the street from Mar-a-Lago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House shot back with its own fiery reply to Newsom’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, sent this in response to a request for comment: “Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing! If Gavin Newscum’s﻿   support for the climate agenda was sincere, he would not be attending a climate summit that required chopping down thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest for a special purpose highway. It’s time for Newscum and other countries to drop the climate facade. President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  The special-purpose highway Rogers referred to is a four-lane road built through the rainforest to Belém, which Brazilian authorities say was planned before the city’s COP bid.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also spoke about the need to make the climate crisis more tangible. Talking about average global temperature rises and using terms like “greenhouse gas” makes climate change seem “abstract,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  People can see climate change unfolding before their eyes, he added, referring to the  devastating Los Angeles wildfires  in January, which scientists say were made larger and more intense by planet-warming pollution.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also talked about the need for the Democratic party to reframe climate action around affordability in upcoming elections, pointing to rising energy costs as Trump pulls away from clean energy and an insurance crisis unfolding in the US as extreme weather becomes increasingly destructive.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to talk in terms that people understand … it’s about people, it’s about places, it’s about lifestyles, it’s about traditions,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:59:00-05:00","title":"The Last Penny Was Minted in Philadelphia Today — A 238-Year Legacy Ends","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia minted the final U.S. penny on November 12, 2025, marking the end of a 238-year tradition that began in 1787.

today in Philadelphia \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:59 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The American penny passed away today after a prolonged illness. It was 238 years old.\n \n\n   \n  The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia, overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach .  President Donald Trump announced via social media in February that he instructed the Mint to  stop making  the once-popular coin, citing the cost of production.\n \n\n   \n  The penny  costs nearly four cents  to mint, more than the coin’s worth. Once valuable enough to buy “penny candy” like gumballs and feed parking meters or toll booths, today the penny lives mostly in coin jars, junk drawers or “leave a penny/take a penny” trays.\n \n\n   \n  Beach said Wednesday that the final coins pressed will be auctioned off and that the actual last pennies put into circulation from the US Mint were struck in June.   \n \n\n   \n  The penny outlived its sibling, the half-penny, by 168 years. It’s survived by the nickel, dime, quarter, and rarely seen half-dollar and dollar coins.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its demise, the penny will remain  legal tender .\n \n\n   \n    Problems despite long planned end\n \n\n   \n  For a coin that seems obsolete, its removal from circulation is causing more problems than expected, especially for retailers.\n \n\n   \n  Some merchants plan to round prices to the nearest nickel, often a penny or two more. Others are asking customers to pay with pennies to help supply. But in some states, merchants could face legal trouble for rounding up or down.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, any savings from discontinuing the one-cent coin could be offset by the need to press more nickels, which costs the US Mint  more money  than the penny.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s phasing out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic,” said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, the company that provides the blanks used to make pennies. “By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”\n \n\n   \n  Weller said other countries that removed low denomination coins, like Canada, Australia and Switzerland, had guidance for afterwards. Not so in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said, referring to the president’s February announcement.\n \n\n   \n    Different rounding plans\n \n\n   \n  Kwik Trip, a family-owned convenience store chain that operates in the Midwest, decided to round down cash purchases in stores where it hasn’t been able to find pennies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” said John McHugh, spokesperson for the company. “I mean, it’s not their fault that there there’s a penny shortage.”\n \n\n   \n  But with 20 million customers a year, and 17% of them paying with cash, the policy will eventually cost Kwik Trip a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just businesses that face increased costs. Rounding to the closest nickel will cost consumers about $6 million a year, according to a July study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is fairly modest, coming to about five cents each across 133 million American households.\n \n\n   \n  And rounding is not a national solution.\n \n\n   \n  Four states - Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon - as well as numerous cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington, DC, require merchants to provide exact change, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the law covering the federal food assistance program known as SNAP requires that recipients not be charged more than other customers. Since SNAP recipients use a debit card that’s charged the precise amount, if merchants round down prices for cash purchases, they could be opening themselves to legal problems and fines, said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for NACS.\n \n\n   \n  “Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” Lenard said. “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, NACS and other retail groups recently wrote to Congress asking for legislation to deal with the questions raised by the end of penny production.\n \n\n   \n    End of a ‘wonderful life’\n \n\n   \n  The penny was one of the nation’s first coins, first minted in 1787, six years before the Mint itself was established.\n \n\n   \n  Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with designing the first penny known as the Fugio cent. Its current form arrived in 1909 on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, when it became the first American coin to feature a president.\n \n\n   \n  But it has declined in both use and popularity ever since. The Treasury Department now says there are  an estimated 300 billion pennies  in circulation. That comes to a bit less than $9 for every American. But most of those coins are “severely underutilized.” So, outcry from the public over its demise has been muted.\n \n\n   \n  Joe Ditler, a 74-year old writer and historian from Colorado, said he still has an old cigar box filled with mostly pennies given to him by his grandfather. He remembers flattening pennies on railroad tracks or souvenir machines in amusement parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he only occasionally uses pennies to make a cash purchase. And he often tosses the one-cent coin in the tip jar.\n \n\n   \n  “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said. “The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”\n \n\n   \n   -CNN’s Danny Freeman contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/kazakhstan-lgbtq-propaganda-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"1112-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-04:00","title":"Kazakhstan follows Russia in banning ‘LGBTQ propaganda’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kazakhstan’s lower parliament, the Mäjilis, has advanced a bill banning the dissemination of information containing 'propaganda of pedophilia and/or non-traditional sexual orientation' in public, media, and online spaces, citing protection for children.

fray regional nerves in an already tense year \n       \n  Analysis by Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:21 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a bustling  Delhi  neighborhood, forensics teams combed through the charred skeleton of a car. Less than 24 hours later, the air outside  Islamabad’s  judicial complex was thick with the aftermath of a suicide bomb.\n \n\n   \n  The two deadly attacks are separate, and no evidence currently links the two. But for the two South Asian rivals, the political shockwave caused by the blasts are a stark reminder of the  lingering security issues  that fester below the surface throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  Explosions in their heavily fortified capitals are a rarity, and two in as many days have put officials in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan on edge, potentially  reigniting a cycle  of suspicion and blame after what has already been a tense year for all countries.\n \n\n   \n  A suicide bombing in Islamabad on Tuesday killed at least 12 people and injured 20 more, marking the deadliest such attack to strike the Pakistani capital in nearly two decades. It came just a day after a rare car explosion tore through a historic Delhi neighborhood, killing at least 10 and leaving more than a dozen wounded.\n \n\n   \n  The twin tragedies have handed political hardliners in both New Delhi and Islamabad a potent weapon, ratcheting up domestic pressure on each government to act decisively.\n \n\n   \n  The blame game ignited almost immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, without providing evidence, accused “Indian terrorist proxies” for the Islamabad attack, claiming it was “backed by India” from Afghan soil. New Delhi fired back, rejecting the “baseless and unfounded allegations” as “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the Delhi blast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring “all those responsible… to justice.” On Wednesday, the Indian government  called  the explosion a “terrorist incident,” which was “perpetrated by anti-national forces.”\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi has not named Pakistan in connection with the explosion, and authorities have so far remained tight lipped as to who they believe might be responsible. But in past attacks, India has frequently  pointed the finger  at Islamabad, which is what makes this week’s twin attacks potentially fraught.\n \n\n   \n  “We are witnessing an increasingly fragile security environment across South Asia,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “South Asia cannot afford further confrontation; the region is being held together by fragile ceasefires with no long-term resolution. What’s needed now is restraint, reflection, and a commitment to reset the regional course toward stability.”\n \n\n   \n    Secure capitals\n \n\n   \n  While both India and Pakistan have historically faced significant security threats, their capitals are meant to be fortresses – home to the seats of government, military leadership, and the diplomatic corps.\n \n\n   \n  In Delhi, the attack struck near the iconic Red Fort, a landmark and tourist hub teeming with crowded bazaars and street vendors. It came hours after police found thousands of kilograms of explosives from a village in Faridabad, a city just outside New Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Faridabad police official confirmed to CNN that police are investigating whether the recovery of these explosives was linked to the Red Fort blast. Police in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been conducting a joint operation across these states, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Modi has  built his brand  on a muscular national security policy, casting himself as the nation’s “watchman” and opposition politicians immediately seized on the alleged security lapse.\n \n\n   \n  “If the country is not safe… if the people are not safe… Questions will be asked,” Supriya Shrinate, a national spokesperson for the Indian National Congress, told local news agency ANI. She criticized the prime minister for traveling to Bhutan a day after the attack. “People… are starting to feel that the country is not in strong hands,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Across the border in Islamabad, the explosion occurred in the parking lot of the judicial complex, an area situated within a district that is home to numerous high-ranking government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan experiences chronic instability at the hands of militants, but Islamabad rarely witnesses such attacks thanks to a heavy security presence with Tuesday’s explosion being the deadliest to strike the capital since 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been carrying a heavy burden and a great distress in my mind,” advocate Jaseem Ahmed Bhutto, who witnessed the attack, told Reuters. “It’s a sense of confusion and concern that if the courts, where every ordinary and prominent person goes and where cases are resolved, are not safe, then who is safe in this city?”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP) behind some of the country’s deadliest attacks over the past decade, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement seen by CNN. The TTP, however, distanced itself, according to its spokesman Mohammad Khursasani.\n \n\n   \n  The bombing prompted a furious response from the government. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif declared a “state of war” and described the attack as a “wake-up call” regarding Afghanistan – a reference to Pakistan’s allegation that militant safe havens on Afghan soil are the source of its problems.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in militant violence since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021, fueling cross-border tensions that recently erupted into the  worst clashes  the two countries have seen in years.   Recent talks  in Qatar and Istanbul aimed at ending the latest cross-border fighting in have made little progress.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban have denied backing the Pakistani Taliban and expressed “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding Tuesday’s attack in Islamabad.\n \n\n   \n  According to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, this year “has been particularly bad” for Pakistan and Afghanistan, “not just in terms of the loss of life of Pakistani soldiers, but many officer ranked personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  This, he noted, is something “the political and military leadership in Pakistan has taken very seriously.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A moment of great volatility’\n \n\n   \n  The cycle of accusations and hyperbole following attacks in India and Pakistan is a well-documented political pattern. And while this rhetoric serves both government’s political needs, it also has the potential to push the countries into dangerous standoffs.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s attacks come “in a moment of great churn and volatility in South Asia,” according to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.\n \n\n   \n  With Pakistan blaming Taliban-backed militants it sees as being   sponsored by India, the situation could escalate, he said. “We’re looking at a potential crisis that could engulf not two but three countries of South Asia: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India,” Kugelman added.\n \n\n   \n  This blame game is fueled by deep-seated narratives on both sides.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Pakistan has accused India of sponsoring terrorism on its soil, claiming that Indian intelligence uses Afghanistan as a base to support anti-Pakistan militants like the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, India has long accused Pakistan of supporting and harboring militants that carry out attacks. Both sides deny each other’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s blaming of India for Tuesday’s suicide attack comes just months after the two nuclear-armed rivals engaged in their most intense fighting in decades: a  four-day conflict  in May featuring clashes with fighter jets, missiles, and drones.\n \n\n   \n  That deadly conflict was  triggered by a massacre  at a scenic mountain spot in India-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Following a familiar script, India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied. Modi  redefined  India’s policy on terrorism in the aftermath, which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered “an act of war.” New Delhi launched airstrikes against its neighbor, which prompted a swift military retaliation from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  According to Humayun, many in Pakistan might have been watching the aftermath of the Delhi blast with “bated breath,” anxious to see if the familiar finger-pointing from India would begin. He highlighted the initial “restraint on the Indian side” as a departure from that script.\n \n\n   \n  But if the Indian government suggests the blast was a terrorist attack, “the public will likely expect something big in response from the Indian government,” Kugelman said. “That said, I don’t think there will be as much pressure on New Delhi.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s principal counter-terrorism body, the National Investigation Agency, has taken over the probe.\n \n\n   \n  As governments separately attempt to get to the bottom of both attacks, the citizens of Delhi and Islamabad are left cleaning up the debris and mourning their dead.\n \n\n   \n  Both capitals had, for years, been largely “insulated from these kinds of incidents,” Humayun said.\n \n\n   \n  That they can now occur in these cities suggest that this type of vulnerability “is no longer just a symptom of the hinterland. It’s coming to major metropolises.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"FDA and HHS Reconsider Black Box Warning on Menopausal Hormone Therapy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the removal of the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, reversing a policy established in 2003 after the Women’s Health Initiative study raised concerns about heart disease and cancer risks. Makary and colleagues argue that newer evidence shows significant long-term benefits, including reduced heart disease and dementia risks, and claim hormone therapy is as impactful as vaccines. However, medical experts and advocacy groups remain deeply divided, citing flawed data, outdated studies, and a lack of new clinical trials, especially for systemic hormone therapies like pills. Critics point out that the FDA did not follow standard advisory committee procedures and that claims of broad benefits—such as preventing heart disease or extending life—exceed approved indications. The decision is particularly controversial because it removes warnings from systemic therapies while leaving only a caution for women with uteruses who take estrogen alone. Experts stress that hormone therapy should be used with caution, tailored to individual health profiles, and that non-hormonal alternatives like Veozah and Lynkuet are available. The article underscores the need for a balanced, evidence-based approach that acknowledges both benefits and risks to ensure patient safety and informed decision-making.","keyTakeAways":["The FDA and HHS have announced the removal of the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, citing new scientific evidence that shows benefits in reducing heart disease, dementia, and improving quality of life.","The decision was driven by a review of newer research indicating that transdermal hormone therapies (like creams and patches) may have lower risks than systemic forms (like pills), and that the original black box warning was based on flawed, outdated, or misinterpreted data.","Medical experts and advocacy groups remain divided, with concerns that the removal of the warning is scientifically unjustified for systemic hormone therapies (e.g., pills, injections) and could lead to overuse, especially among women without clear medical need.","The FDA's decision was made without convening a traditional advisory committee, raising concerns about transparency and adherence to standard regulatory processes.","Experts stress that hormone therapy is not a panacea — it has both benefits and risks that vary by individual health status, age, and medical history, and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.","Non-hormonal alternatives for managing menopausal symptoms (such as Veozah and Lynkuet) have been FDA-approved, offering patients additional options and encouraging more balanced decision-making.","The removal of the warning was particularly controversial because it omitted key findings from major studies, such as randomized controlled trials showing no benefit on heart disease, and relied on older or less rigorous research."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Robert F.

Doctors are pushing for balance \n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to  remove the “black box” warning  on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.\n \n\n   \n  By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near  antibiotics and vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Makary blamed the broad   22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”\n \n\n   \n  “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.\n \n\n   \n  Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.\n \n\n   \n  They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a  comprehensive research review  published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.\n \n\n   \n  Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.\n \n\n   \n  After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”\n \n\n   \n    How the FDA pivoted\n \n\n   \n  In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.\n \n\n   \n  After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered   that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.\n \n\n   \n  Women stopped using hormones in droves.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.\n \n\n   \n  “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”\n \n\n   \n  Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.\n \n\n   \n  Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch  most of the black box warning  — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an  expert panel  discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to  a Viewpoint article  co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)\n \n\n   \n  “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.\n \n\n   \n  But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.”  The study  Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.\n \n\n   \n  Makary also didn’t mention   the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of   [hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.\n \n\n   \n  Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.\n \n\n   \n  The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”\n \n\n   \n  In the past, the agency has followed  a very different protocol  when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment   Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency  followed similar steps , including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”\n \n\n   \n    Looking for a more balanced approach\n \n\n   \n  In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.\n \n\n   \n  Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.\n \n\n   \n  Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.\n \n\n   \n  Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.\n \n\n   \n  This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.\n \n\n   \n  “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.\n \n\n   \n  Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.\n \n\n   \n  “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the evidence shows about hormones\n \n\n   \n  All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.\n \n\n   \n  “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”\n \n\n   \n  There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988.  One study  estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.\n \n\n   \n  But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.\n \n\n   \n  Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.\n \n\n   \n  “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”\n \n\n   \n  Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.\n \n\n   \n  Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”\n \n\n   \n  Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent viewpoint  published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.\n \n\n   \n  “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   \n  Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.\n \n\n   \n  She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.\n \n\n   \n  “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/uk/starmer-leadership-plot-streeting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00-05:00","title":"Rumors swirl of a plot to oust Keir Starmer as the embattled British leader denies attacking his rivals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a major political crisis after rumors emerged that senior Labour Party members, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, are being briefed against him as part of a potential leadership challenge.

Accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of presiding over a “toxic” culture in Downing Street, Starmer was forced to address the reports that his allies were briefing against senior members of his government.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer told Parliament that he had not authorized the negative briefings against his colleagues. “I appointed them to their posts because they’re the best people to carry out their jobs,” he said. “Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest crisis to hit the government comes ahead of a budget announcement on November 26, when Labour – in order to fill a fiscal black hole – is expected to break a key election pledge by increasing the basic rate of income tax for the first time in half a century.\n \n\n   \n  Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that both tax rises and spending cuts are possible when she lays out her plans for the year ahead, seeking to cut government debt. That would likely spur further attacks from Nigel Farage, whose upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party has led Labour in national polls for months.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer’s popularity went into freefall soon after Labour won a landslide general election victory in July 2024. YouGov, a pollster, said this month that just 17% of Britons approve of the job Starmer is doing as prime minister, while 73% disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  The decision by Starmer’s allies to brief against Streeting, the minister tasked with repairing Britain’s depleted National Health Service, bewildered and blindsided many Labour Party politicians and has raised questions about the prime minister’s control of his governing operation in Downing Street.\n \n\n   \n  “People are flummoxed,” one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. “Nobody quite understands where this briefing is coming from.”\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers are also perplexed by the timing of the briefing. After an unsteady first 16 months in office left Starmer one of the most unpopular British prime ministers on record, Labour MPs had previously signaled that the prime minister would not face a serious leadership contest until after local elections in May 2026, giving his government time to reverse its decline in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the Tuesday night briefing raised the possibility that Starmer could face a leadership challenge after the budget.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Streeting’s denial that he is seeking to challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, a “Wes for Leader” website was created on Tuesday. CNN has asked Streeting’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Rumors of a leadership challenge last swirled in September, when Andy Burnham – a former MP and the current mayor of Greater Manchester – launched an audacious and abortive attempt at challenging Starmer’s approach on the eve of Labour’s annual conference.\n \n\n   \n  Ousting a Labour leader is difficult, however, since any challenger would need the support of 20% of the party’s members of parliament, meaning 80 lawmakers would need to agree on an alternative candidate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/trump-bbc-sue-one-billion-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens $1 Billion Lawsuit Against BBC Over Documentary Edit of January 6 Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over alleged defamatory and misleading edits in a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' that aired in October 2024.

 By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:17 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for  $1 billion  over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory”  edits  to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I think I have an obligation to do it … because you can’t allow people to do that,” Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. He said the BBC had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    What is the scandal about?\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK –  the Guardian praised  it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter  to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    How did the scandal originate?\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial position, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns   about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his  Substack . “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n \n\n   \n  Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor,  reported  Sunday   that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n \n\n   \n    Have heads rolled?\n \n\n   \n  Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n \n\n   \n  Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n    What is the BBC? Who owns it?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has expressed disbelief that “one of our great allies” could treat him so dishonestly. “(The) BBC – the government has a chunk of that one, I guess,” he said in Tuesday’s interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  The British government does not “have a chunk” of the BBC. The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter,” which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n \n\n   \n  It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n \n\n   \n  Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n \n\n   \n  More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n \n\n   \n    Is the BBC impartial?\n \n\n   \n  Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences. The broadcaster says it is committed to “achieving due impartiality” in all its output.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that, as with every news outlet, mistakes happen, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n  But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump threatened?\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n \n\n   \n  The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n \n\n   \n    Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n \n\n   \n  It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n \n\n   \n  Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the case being brought in Florida?\n \n\n   \n  In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n \n\n   \n  “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n \n\n   \n    Has Trump threatened media outlets before?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay  $15 million  in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay  $16 million  to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n \n\n   \n  Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-agents-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Gregory Bovino and Border Patrol Agents Plan to Leave Chicago Amid Legal and Political Pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, is planning to leave Chicago as early as this week to relocate his operations to Charlotte, North Carolina, and then to New Orleans, as part of President Donald Trump’s broader immigration enforcement strategy.

      \n  By Priscilla Alvarez, Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:30 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in cities, along with his agents, are planning to leave Chicago as early as this week as they eye other locations to ramp up arrests, according to three US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino  has become the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there — first in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his officers are expected to head to Charlotte, North Carolina, then continue to New Orleans, according to two of the officials, who stressed plans are still being finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office “has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began. CBS News first  reported  Bovino planned to leave Chicago soon.\n \n\n   \n    Potential move comes after personal rebuke from judge\n \n\n   \n  The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally  called out  by a federal judge.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, “unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.”\n \n\n   \n  That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is  appealing  the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be  delayed  while an appeals court panel considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were “violent rioters and assaultive subjects.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a “reportable use of force” because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. “In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    President has publicly discussed other cities for operations\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  While Bovino and his team’s relocation is not yet final, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the news Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Greg Bovino’s legacy in Chicago is chaos, criminality, and terror,” Johnson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the grassroots resistance to Bovino that has forced them to retreat,” the mayor added. “Bovino did nothing to make our city safer. He will not be missed in Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  “This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety — this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets,” said a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Dianne Gallagher and Danya Gainor contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/latin-grammy-awards-how-to-watch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:14:00Z","title":"Everything you need to know about the 2025 Latin Grammy Awards","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Latin Grammy Awards are set for November 13, 2025, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, marking a significant cultural and entertainment event in the global Latin music scene.

Last year’s ceremony was held in Miami, where the Latin Recording Academy is headquartered.\n \n\n   \n  The Latin Grammys will broadcast live on TelevisaUnivision’s US platforms – Univision, UNIMÁS, ViX and Galavisión – beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An hourlong pre-show will begin at 7 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Like the  Grammys , the majority of the Latin Grammys are handed out during the Latin Grammy Premiere ceremony, which precedes the telecast.\n \n\n   \n    Who is performing at the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n   Bad Bunny , CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso, Karol G, Marco Antonio Solís, Chuwi, Fuerza Regida and its singer Jesús Ortiz Paz will all perform.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s not all: Pepe Aguilar, Aitana, Ivan Cornejo, DannyLux, Gloria Estefan, Kakalo, Carín León, Liniker, Morat and Los Tigres del Norte will also hit the stage, as well as the Latin Grammy’s 2025 Person of the Year, Raphael.\n \n\n   \n    Who is hosting the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic duo of Maluma and actor, producer and musician Roselyn Sánchez will host. This marks Sánchez’s eighth time hosting the awards.\n \n\n   \n    What’s new at the 2025 Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  There is a new field in 2025, for visual media, and two new categories: music for visual media and roots song.\n \n\n   \n  The former will recognize original music for movies, TV shows, video games and other visual media. For a project to participate in this category, it must feature Latin rhythms or be composed by someone of Ibero American descent.\n \n\n   \n  The roots award will go to the songwriters of new, unpublished recordings that reflect the traditions and roots of various communities, cultures, or social groups, especially those of Hispanic American origin, whether in Spanish, Portuguese or Indigenous languages or dialects.\n \n\n   \n  The best urban/urban fusion performance category also has a new name, and its criteria has also changed. Now, remixes are eligible only if the original version of the song was released within the same eligibility year. The required percentage of urban elements has increased from 51% to 60% to qualify in this category.\n \n\n   \n    Who is nominated for the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  Who else but Bad Bunny leads the nominations with 12. He dethroned producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera – known for his work with Bad Bunny as well as Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira, Grupo Frontera and beyond – who previously topped the list in 2023 and 2024 with 13 and 9 nominations, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Don’t cry for him, though: Barrera is tied with Argentinian hip-hop duo CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso for the second most nominations. They have 10 each.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Bad Bunny, CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso are also nominated in the album of the year category, which is rounded out by Rauw Alejandro, Gloria Estefan, Vicente García, Joaquina, Natalia Lafourcade, Carín León, Liniker, Elena Rose and Alejandro Sanz.\n \n\n   \n  Both Bad Bunny and CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso are nominated twice in the record of the year category, which also features artists Lafourcade, Sanz, Jorge Drexler & Conociendo Rusia, Zoe Gotusso, Karol G and Liniker.\n \n\n   \n  The best new artist category nominees are Alleh, Annasofia, Yerai Cortés, Juliane Gamboa, Camila Guevara, Isadora, Alex Luna, Paloma Morphy, Sued Nunes and Ruzzi.\n \n\n   \n    What is the relationship between the Latin Grammys and the Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud likened the Recording Academy – the governing body behind the Grammys – and the Latin Recording Academy to sister organizations.\n \n\n   \n  While the Grammys focus on the US market, he said the Latin Grammys have different global considerations. “Our voting process is, I would say, identical, but it has some adjustments for the international component that we have that they don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the relationship between the Grammys and the Latin Grammys will grow even closer in 2026. Last week, the Recording Academy announced that all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy as part of its 2025 new member class.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/katseye-death-threats-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"09:58:00-05:00","title":"KATSEYE Say They Receive Thousands of Death Threats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"KATSEYE, a global girl group formed through the 2024 Netflix docuseries 'Pop Star Academy', has revealed they face frequent online death threats and intense hate, despite their success and acclaim.

 the global girl group propelled to stardom through the 2024 Netflix show “Pop Star Academy,” revealed they are frequently targets of online death threats and hate.\n \n\n   \n   The diverse ensemble,  based in Los Angeles but made up of six young women from countries across the globe — members hail from the United States, Switzerland, the Philippines and South Korea — told the BBC that internet scrutiny is a burden they bear.\n \n\n   \n  Second-generation Indian-American Lara Raj, 20, admitted that online abuse takes a toll on the band, saying, “If a thousand people are sending you death threats … even if it’s not going to happen … it’s heavy, and it’s jarring.”\n \n\n   \n  The rest of KATSEYE nodded agreement, before the interviewer, Mark Savage, asked the women if they’d all received threats of this nature. Without hesitation, all six members of the group confirmed death threats were a common occurrence, chorusing “yes” and “so many.”\n \n\n   \n  Now a K-pop phenomenon, Raj and bandmates Daniela Avanzini, Manon Bannerman, Megan Skiendiel, Sophia Laforteza and Yoonchae Jeung all earned their place in KATSEYE after an arduous 12-week audition program, “The Debut: Dream Academy,” which was streamed on YouTube.\n \n\n   \n  Modeled on the K-pop artist development process and organized by K-pop entertainment leader HYBE and US label Geffen Records —   the partnership behind the US distribution and promotion of megastars BTS — the hopefuls completed missions requiring them to choreograph, rehearse and perform for hours a day.\n \n\n   \n  Netflix followed the 20 contestants from beginning to end, releasing a docuseries on its platform in August 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Laforteza, who is 22 and originally from the Philippine capital, Manila, told the BBC the training program was “very rigorous, very demanding,” adding that it “really equipped us for where we are now.”\n \n\n   \n  The band, which received Grammy nominations last week for best new artist and best group performance,   shared their concerns about the power of the internet.\n \n\n   \n  Laforteza and Raj said social media allows them to see how they are perceived by swathes of people from around the world, something none of the band believes to be safe; reading comments can be “terrorizing on the mind,” according to Bannerman.\n \n\n   \n  She described the “constant comparison between all of us,” before the other band members explained how they are often ranked online and pitted against one another in a points-based system they said considers factors including how pretty they are, how they sing and how they perform. “It’s so dystopian,” Raj said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, KATSEYE are undeterred. “We’ve all come from different places with different cultures and upbringings yet we’re able to come together and create magic through music,” Laforteza said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/listeria-food-safety-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00-05:00","title":"At least 27 people sickened and 6 dead in latest US listeria outbreak.

least 27 people sickened and 6 dead in latest US listeria outbreak. What you should know \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:56 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Six people have died due to a  multistate outbreak of listeria  linked to recalled prepared pasta meals sold at major grocery chains, including Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market and Trader Joe’s.\n \n\n   \n  The  warning by federal health officials  noted at least 27 reported cases of infection across 18 states, and health officials said that a pregnant woman lost her fetus after becoming ill.\n \n\n   \n  I wanted to know more about listeria contamination and why it’s dangerous. What symptoms should people watch for, and how is the infection diagnosed and treated? Who is most at risk for severe illness, and what foods are most often linked to outbreaks like this one? And as we head into the holiday season, what can people do to reduce their chances of getting sick from foodborne bacteria?\n \n\n   \n  To help me with these questions, I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What is listeria, and why is it dangerous? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria found in soil, water and certain foods that can cause a serious infection known as  listeriosis . Unlike many other foodborne pathogens, listeria can grow at refrigerator temperatures, which means it can survive and multiply in foods that are already cooked or stored cold. It most often contaminates ready-to-eat foods such as deli meats, soft cheeses, smoked fish, unpasteurized dairy products and refrigerated prepared meals.\n \n\n   \n  For  most healthy adults , a mild infection may cause only brief flu-like symptoms, but for certain people, including pregnant people, newborns, older adults and those with weakened immune systems, listeriosis can be severe. It can cause bloodstream infections, meningitis, or pregnancy complications like preterm labor, miscarriage and stillbirth. Listeria infection is the third leading cause of death from foodborne infection in the United States, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Each year, about 172 people die from infection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms should people watch for? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:   Symptoms of listeriosis often start with fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea or diarrhea. In more serious cases, the infection spreads beyond the gut and can cause severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, seizures and whole-body infection resulting in organ failure. Pregnant patients may experience only mild flu-like symptoms, but the infection can be devastating to a developing fetus.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is listeria diagnosed and treated? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Doctors diagnose listeriosis through laboratory testing, usually by identifying the bacteria in a blood sample, spinal fluid or other body fluid. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary beyond monitoring symptoms, but in more severe cases, antibiotics are required. Pregnant people, newborns, older adults and immunocompromised individuals may be hospitalized for closer monitoring and supportive care. Early diagnosis and treatment significantly improve outcomes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What should consumers do if they have the recalled products at home? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Anyone who purchased the recalled pasta meals should not eat them, even if they look or smell fine. The bacteria can’t be seen, smelled or tasted. And just because someone else has eaten it and has not gotten sick doesn’t mean that it’s safe for you to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Check your refrigerator and freezer for any recalled brands or packaging, and either return them to the store or throw them away in a sealed plastic bag to prevent cross-contamination. Wash and sanitize any surfaces, shelves or containers that may have come into contact with the recalled products. If you or a family member has eaten one of the recalled foods and developed symptoms consistent with listeriosis, contact your health care provider.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: As we head into the holiday season, what can people do to reduce their chances of getting sick from foodborne bacteria? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The high-profile outbreaks that make headlines can give the impression that foodborne illnesses mainly come from restaurants or packaged foods purchased in stores. In reality, only a small portion of cases are traced to commercial products; most occur in our own kitchens, where bacteria and viruses can easily spread through everyday handling of food. Practicing careful hygiene and safe cooking habits at home is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of infection.\n \n\n   \n  Among all foodborne pathogens,  norovirus  is the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness in the US. It spreads quickly from person to person and through contaminated food, especially when infected individuals handle meals before or during preparation.\n \n\n   \n  Frequent, thorough handwashing with soap and water is essential, especially before cooking, after using the bathroom and after touching shared surfaces. Anyone with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or stomach cramps should stay home and avoid preparing or serving food to others until they have been symptom-free for at least two days. This applies not only to norovirus but to other contagious gastrointestinal ailments as well.\n \n\n   \n  Undercooked meat, poultry and seafood are another leading source of  foodborne illness , including infections from bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli .  Cooking foods to their  proper internal temperatures  kills these pathogens: Chicken, turkey and other poultry should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius); fish should be cooked to 145 F (63 C); and ground meats such as beef or pork should reach at least 160 F (71 C). Using a food thermometer is the most reliable way to ensure these temperatures are met.\n \n\n   \n  Cross-contamination is also a frequent problem. Cutting boards, knives and plates that have been in contact with raw meat, seafood or poultry should never be reused for cooked or ready-to-eat foods unless they have been thoroughly washed in hot, soapy water. Keeping separate utensils and cutting surfaces for raw and cooked foods greatly reduces the risk of spreading bacteria.\n \n\n   \n  Fresh fruits and vegetables should always be washed, even if they’ll be peeled before eating. Rinsing under running water is usually sufficient; avoid using soaps or household cleaners, which can leave residues that are unsafe to consume. For firm produce like melons or cucumbers, using a clean brush can help remove dirt and bacteria from the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Proper storage is another key part of prevention. Perishable foods should be refrigerated within two hours of cooking — or within one hour if the air temperature is above 90 F (32 C). Leftovers should be stored in shallow containers so they cool quickly, and refrigerators should be kept at 40 F (4 C) or lower. Freezers should be set at 0 F (-18 C) or below. Food left out too long provides ideal conditions for bacteria such as listeria and staphylococcus to multiply rapidly.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid unpasteurized milk and dairy products, as well as juices or ciders that have not been pasteurized, since these can contain harmful bacteria. Pregnant people, older adults and anyone with a weakened immune system should be particularly careful to avoid these products, as they carry a higher risk of serious illness.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to local and national health advisories. Health departments and the CDC frequently issue alerts when contaminated foods are identified or when outbreaks are detected at local restaurants or grocery chains. Following these updates and checking your kitchen for recalled items can help you act quickly to prevent illness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-video-tribute-cleto-escobedo-iii","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"08:49:00-05:00","title":"Jimmy Kimmel’s tribute to Cleto Escobedo III, his dear friend and bandleader","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jimmy Kimmel delivered a heartfelt tribute on his late-night show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to honor his longtime childhood friend and bandleader, Cleto Escobedo III, who died at age 59.

threat \n       \n  By Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:31 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC board held an unexpected meeting on Wednesday as the British broadcaster stares down a l egal threat from President Trump , a source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The person, who had direct knowledge of the meeting, said the board is not planning to issue any immediate statement afterward. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s meeting is the latest sign of a scramble inside the BBC to address the fallout from last week’s Telegraph newspaper story about a  serious editing error  in a October 2024 documentary about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the president sent a demand letter to the BBC on Monday, one day after two top executives resigned amid the editing controversy.\n \n\n   \n  The letter claimed that Trump suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” due to the bad edit, even though the error did not garner attention at the time of the broadcast. The letter asserted that the entire documentary should be retracted and warned of a $1 billion lawsuit if Trump’s demands are not met.\n \n\n   \n  With dramatic flair, it assigned a Friday deadline and said “the BBC is on notice.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a lengthy history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances. And he has used both lawsuits and the threat of suits to win settlements and concessions from other parties.\n \n\n   \n  British media outlets have been consumed with stories about whether the BBC will try to appease Trump, or will stand up to him, like The Times and The Journal have.

the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following US criticism of its climate focus.\n \n\n   \n  The IEA also predicted in its annual outlook that the world would likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris-based energy security watchdog has been under pressure from the United States for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, the IEA predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Peak oil’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called the IEA’s demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The agency is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor.\n \n\n   \n  In its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the IEA predicted that under a “current policies scenario” oil demand would hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario – which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition – is based on existing government policies and not

said on its website Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In the IEA’s “stated policies scenario,” which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.\n \n\n   \n    LNG capacity to soar\n \n\n   \n  Final investment decisions for

CNN\n \n   \n  2025 was an epic year for American women’s  tennis .\n \n\n   \n  Two singles grand slam champions in the shape of  Madison Keys  and  Coco Gauff,  who reigned supreme at the Australian and French Opens, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  An American featured in all four singles grand slam finals, with  Amanda Anisimova  finishing runner-up at both Wimbledon and US Open finals.\n \n\n   \n  Statistically, it was the most successful season for American women on record in nearly a quarter of a century.\n \n\n   \n  The bold accomplishments and records by their compatriots are not lost on male counterparts  Taylor Fritz  and  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Inspired by the repeated achievements of the US women, the American duo – who compete at this week’s season-ending Nitto ATP Finals in Turin – stand ready to grasp the nettle and write their own piece of history.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not just this year that they’ve had really success, it’s pretty much every year for a long time,” Fritz tells CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “The women have been really carrying US tennis, so it is time for the men to step up.”\n \n\n   \n    Upwards trajectory\n \n\n   \n  And step up is what the US pair have done.\n \n\n   \n  After four American women – the aforementioned trio plus  Jessica Pegula  – competed in the WTA Finals in Riyadh earlier this month, the most since 2002, Fritz and Shelton have laid down their own marker.\n \n\n   \n  The 28- and 23-year-olds, respectively, became the first pair to represent the US in the singles at the men’s equivalent event for 19 years.\n \n\n   \n  You have to go all the way back to 2006 in Shanghai for the last time that happened, when major champion Andy Roddick and James Blake made up the eight-man field.\n \n\n   \n  That year, Blake made an impressive run to the title match before eventually losing out to Roger Federer.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to this year and Fritz returned to Turin for a third time, having been a semifinalist in 2022 and a runner-up last year, while Shelton is making his debut.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his loss to  Jannik Sinner  in the 2024 Final, for Fritz, it was the cherry on top of a career-best year that saw him reach the final at Flushing Meadows off the back of two grand slam quarterfinal appearances in Melbourne and Wimbledon.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt like my level at the end of the year was really good,” says the 6-foot-5-inch right-hander.\n \n\n   \n  “I proved a lot of things that gave me a lot of confidence that I’m really right there and also made it clear as well, the things that I need to improve on … moving forward to try to contend against the other top guys.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘This is where you want to be’\n \n\n   \n  While not scaling the same heights this year, Fritz has still added two trophies to his cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  For Shelton, 2025 has been a year of marked improvement, backed up by a maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto – his biggest tournament victory to date.\n \n\n   \n  All this having finished outside the world’s top 20 last year.\n \n\n   \n  And the rising Atlanta-born star is relishing the opportunity to compete with some of the biggest names on the biggest stage this week.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a big goal for me at the beginning of the year,” he says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that I had my work cut out and had a lot of improvements that I needed to make to be here at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is where you want to be, this is where you want to end your year … making the last push in a place like this with a lot on the line makes it pretty easy.”\n \n\n   \n  And an added incentive lies in both players knowing that whoever performs better on the blue indoor courts of Turin will end the year as the No. 1 American.\n \n\n   \n    Grand slam quest\n \n\n   \n  Shelton, though, is not content with just participating.\n \n\n   \n  He, like Fritz, wants to regularly compete for the biggest and best prizes in the sport.\n \n\n   \n  And that means winning majors.\n \n\n   \n  While in this day and age and on current form it seems hard, if not near enough impossible, for anyone to lay even a glove on the current irresistible force in the men’s game – that of Jannik Sinner and  Carlos Alcaraz  – the American is convinced the stranglehold can be broken.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold claim, considering he and Fritz have combined for just two wins in 22 official matches against the dominant duo.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon’s rationale? Depth, resilience and desire among the US contingent.\n \n\n   \n  “We have multiple guys at the top of the game and we want to be dominant as a country,” he says confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had our work cut out for us to catch up to the women who have been dominating … but we’re getting closer.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been over two decades now since the US last crowned a men’s grand slam singles champion. Only Fritz has come closest to ending the hex.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have a time frame. I’ve said a lot that’s for the media to speculate,” Shelton explains.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s too much talent right now for us not to break through at some point. The media will write article after article about the drought or who’s going to be the next or when is going to be the next.\n \n\n   \n  “I just know that it’s inevitable and I’m just excited to kind of be a part of that surge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Time will tell whether that prophecy comes to fruition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-pardon-letter-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:50:00-05:00","title":"Trump Pens Letter Asking Israeli President to Pardon Netanyahu in Corruption Trial","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump has written a letter to Israeli President Yitzhak Herzog urging a full pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing criminal charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust — the first incumbent Israeli prime minister to be prosecuted while in office.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Trump penned a letter asking the  Israeli  president to grant a full pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter distributed by the Israeli president’s spokesperson, Trump wrote, “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  For any other president, the letter would be an unusual intervention in the domestic politics of a foreign country. But it’s only Trump’s latest effort to intervene on behalf of one of his most vocal international supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases which began in Trump’s first term. He has entered a plea of not guilty and maintains his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that the ‘case’ against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political,  unjustified prosecution,” Trump wrote in the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceremonial nature of the role, Herzog has the power to issue pardons. But the request must come from the individual accused of wrongdoing, their legal representatives or a family member. Neither Netanyahu nor any of his close associates have submitted such a petition.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Herzog’s office said that he holds Trump “in high regard” and appreciates his “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza, and the safeguarding of Israel’s security”.\n \n\n   \n  But Herzog’s office also said that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump backs global allies\n \n\n   \n  Trump has weighed in on Netanyahu’s trial several times before. In June, after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he wrote a lengthy post on Truth Social in which he called Netanyahu’s trial a “ridiculous witch hunt,” echoing language he’s used about his own legal threats.\n \n\n   \n  And last month, during his short trip to Israel, Trump raised the issue of a pardon during his address to Israel’s parliament.\n \n\n   \n  Turning to Herzog seated nearby, he said, “Mr. President, why don’t you give him a pardon?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new letter sparked conflicting reactions across the Israeli political spectrum.\n \n\n   \n  Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: “President Herzog, listen to President Trump!”, he said, claiming that the “disgraceful” indictments against Netanyahu “have long since become an indictment against the prosecution itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Opposition Leader Yair Lapid responded to the letter in a statement, saying, “A reminder: Israeli law clearly stipulates that the first condition for a presidential pardon is admitting guilt and expressing remorse.”\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office.\n \n\n   \n  His trial on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust began in May 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of testimony, judgment, and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.\n \n\n   \n  It is not the first time Trump attempted to intervene in overseas ongoing judicial proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  In July, in a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to end their prosecution of another international ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has since been convicted of plotting a coup, saying Bolsonaro was “not guilty of anything, except having fought for people.”\n \n\n   \n  In April, he came out in support of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, when she was barred from running for political office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.\n \n\n   \n  “The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison,” he posted. “It is the same ‘playbook’ that was used against me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/pope-leo-favorite-movies-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00+00:00","title":"Pope Leo shares his all-time favorite movies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV has revealed his top four favorite films, all from the 20th century, including 'It’s a Wonderful Life,' 'The Sound of Music,' 'Ordinary People,' and 'Life Is Beautiful,' each highlighting themes of hope, human dignity, and resilience.

The discovery could help settle a long-standing debate among scientists about whether insects are able to process complex patterns, Versace told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, it was thought that they were just very basic reflex machines that don’t have any flexibility,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  To reach its finding, the team set up a maze through which individual bees would travel when they left their nest to forage for food.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers presented the insects with two visual cues: one circle that would light up with a short flash and another with a long flash of light.\n \n\n   \n  Approaching these respective circles, the bees would find a sweet food that they like at one, and a bitter food, which they don’t, at the other.\n \n\n   \n  The circles were in different positions at each room in the maze, but the bees still learned over varying amounts of time to fly toward the short flash of light associated with the sweet food.\n \n\n   \n  Davidson and Versace then tested the bees’ behavior when there was no food present, to rule out the possibility that the bees could see or smell the sugary food.\n \n\n   \n  They found that the bees were able to tell the circles apart based on the duration of the flashes of light, rather than other cues.\n \n\n   \n  “And so in this way, we show that the bee is actually processing the time difference between them to guide its foraging choice,” Davidson said.\n \n\n   \n  “We were happy to see that, in fact, the bees can process stimuli that, during the course of evolution, they have never seen before,” Versace said, referring to the flashes of light.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re able to use novel stimulus they have never seen before to solve tasks in a flexible way,” Versace added. “I think this is really remarkable.”\n \n\n   \n  The researchers say bumblebees are one of only a small number of animals, including humans and other vertebrates such as macaques and pigeons, that have been found to be able to differentiate between short and long flashes, in this case between 0.5 and five seconds.\n \n\n   \n  For example, this ability helps humans to understand Morse code, in which a short flash is used to communicate the letter “E” and long flash the letter “T.”\n \n\n   \n    More than ‘just machines’\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear how bees are able to judge time duration, but the team plans to investigate the neural mechanisms that allow the insects to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists are also planning to conduct similar research with bees that are able to move freely in colonies, rather than individually, and investigate the cognitive differences that allow some bees to learn to assess time duration faster than others.\n \n\n   \n  Davidson hopes that the results will help people to appreciate that bees and other insects are not simple “machines essentially driven by instinct,” but rather “complex animals with inner lives that have unique experiences.”\n \n\n   \n  “In fact, they do have complex cognition, this flexibility in learning and memory and behavior,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  This may help people to perceive bees as more than unthinking pollinators, Versace said.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not just machines for our purposes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings also raise important ideas about our own understanding of time, according to Davidson.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s such a fundamental part of our lives and the lives of all animals,” but we still don’t really understand what time is and how we deal with it in our minds, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study is really interesting because it shows that it’s not just a human question,” Davidson said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers reported their findings Wednesday in the journal  Biology Letters .\n \n\n   \n  The study shows “that bees possess a sophisticated sense of time,” according to Cintia Akemi Oi, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research at University College London. Oi was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “This finding makes perfect sense, as bees must carefully manage their time while foraging to maximize rewards and minimize the costs of returning to the nest,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Such studies not only help to understand insect cognition, but also shed light on the shared and unique features of their neuronal functions, offering valuable insights to the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Jolyon Troscianko, a visual ecologist at the University of Exeter in England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the results show that the bees “must be using learning that can measure the length of time.”\n \n\n   \n  The method shows that bees can learn using information from outside their usual ecological context, “which I find fascinating as it demonstrates how this type of general learning can be achieved with brains many orders of magnitude smaller than the birds and rodents that prior work has focused on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Bigger brains are therefore not always necessary to show really impressive cognitive abilities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/tech/quantum-computing-ibm-microsoft-google","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"09:33:00-05:00","title":"A seismic shift in computing is on the horizon (and it’s not AI)","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Quantum computing — a fundamentally different approach to processing information using quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously — is poised to revolutionize industries such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, finance, and cryptography.

seismic shift in computing is on the horizon (and it’s not AI) \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Creating revolutionary pharmaceutical drugs, testing new materials for cars and simulating how market scenarios can affect banks — these are just some of the tasks that could take months or years to develop, even with the most advanced computers.\n \n\n   \n  But what if that timeframe could be cut down to minutes or hours?\n \n\n   \n  That’s the promise behind quantum computing, a field that’s been studied for decades and has garnered increasing   interest — and investments —  from tech giants  and startups alike.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, IBM revealed its new experimental Loon processor and Nighthawk quantum computing chip, which can perform more complex computations than its predecessor. The past two years have seen   quantum-related announcements from  Google , Microsoft and other tech companies.\n \n\n   \n  Quantum computing could potentially lead to a $1.3 trillion increase in value across certain industries by 2035, according to  McKinsey & Company , and for good reason. Experts believe quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in fields like cryptography, finance, science and transportation, and IBM  says  the technology could solve some problems in minutes or hours that would typically take non-quantum standard computers thousands of years.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s a long road ahead. Cracking quantum computing isn’t a matter of upgrading existing computers. It’s an entirely separate approach to computing that relies on the principles of quantum physics.\n \n\n   \n  “A fighter jet is not a faster Ferrari because it has wings,” said Sridhar Tayur, a professor with Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. “Quantum computing is not just a faster classical computer, because it works on a different principle.”\n \n\n   \n    What makes quantum computers different?\n \n\n   \n  Computers store and process information using a language made up of zeros and ones, also known as “bits.” But quantum computing uses “quantum bits,” also known as “qubits.” Instead of being either zero or one, qubits can behave like zero or one simultaneously and exist in states between zero and one, allowing them to process information much more quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Picture it as a flipping coin, as CNN’s  Anna Stewart explained . Bits are the coin when it lands on heads or tails, while qubits are the coin as it’s spinning between heads and tails, or if the coin could represent heads and tails at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  But   don’t expect quantum computers to replace your laptop or smartphone. Instead, these types of computers are ideal for solving big-picture problems involving chemistry and mathematics, making them potentially game-changing in areas such as health, environmental studies, finance, materials science and cryptography.\n \n\n   \n  BMW Group and Airbus, for example, are working with quantum computing startup Quantinuum to research how the technology could be used in the development of fuel cells. Meanwhile, Accenture Labs, biotechnology firm Biogen and quantum computing company 1QBit are  collaborating on research  related to drug discovery. Quantum computers can compare molecules that are much larger than the ones classical computers can compute, Accenture said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  “The big hope is that a quantum computer can simulate any sort of chemical or biological experiment you would do in the lab,” said Anand Natarajan, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences   at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  Quantum computing could be hugely influential when it comes to cryptography and cybersecurity since it can be used to break codes used to protect data, said Natarajan.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s also a major motivation, to make sure that our adversaries cannot do it and that we have this capability,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The  Wall Street Journal  reported in October that a handful of quantum computing companies were discussing potential deals with the Commerce Department that would provide federal funding in exchange for an equity stake.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN that it “is not currently negotiating equity stakes with quantum computing companies.”\n \n\n   \n    The race to crack quantum computing\n \n\n   \n  But the industry has a wave of challenges to overcome before quantum computing can solve modern dilemmas. For example, qubits are extremely fragile, making them very susceptible to external factors like changes in temperature or light.\n \n\n   \n  IBM’s new experimental Loon processor attempts to address this hurdle by demonstrating that the components exist to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer at scale that can function effectively even when errors are present. It’s an important step because errors are inevitable given qubits are so susceptible to interference.\n \n\n   \n  “If I just vibrate a table, I’ll kill our quantum computers. If a little bit of light gets in there, it can hurt it,” said Jay Gambetta, director of research at IBM.\n \n\n   \n  IBM’s new Nighthawk chip, meanwhile, can run more complicated “gates,” according to Gambetta. Gates are the “building blocks” quantum computers use to process information, as the  National Institute of Standards and Technology  describes it.\n \n\n   \n  IBM is just one contender in the quantum computing race. Microsoft in February introduced its  Majorana 1 quantum computing chip . That chip contains a special material the company says can create a new state of matter capable of producing more stable qubits. Google in December  unveiled its Willow quantum computing chip  that it says reduces errors as more qubits are used and can do in five minutes what would take a classical computer 10 septillion years.\n \n\n   \n    There are still some ways to go\n \n\n   \n  The jury is still out on exactly when quantum computing will live up to its potential.\n \n\n   \n  Natarajan believes we’re still likely a decade or two away.  McKinsey said  72% of the tech executives, investors and academics it spoke with say a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer could arrive by 2035. IBM expects to reach fault-tolerant quantum computing by the end of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  But when it does happen, the benefits could be tremendous.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, in some sense … we are trying to do brain surgery using a spoon and a fork. But ideally, to do brain surgery, you would need far more refined tools,” said Tayur of Carnegie Mellon. “And that far more refined tools (are) one of the promises of the quantum computer.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/elaine-luria-us-house-democrats-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:06:00-05:00","title":"Former Rep.

workers grapple with possible shutdown deal as officials try to navigate upcoming holiday travel rush \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Atlanta mom Amanda James’ heart shattered when her soon-to-be 11-year-old uttered the words: “Mom, I don’t have to have a birthday party this year.”\n \n\n   \n  Her son knew both James, a Federal Aviation Administration airway transportation systems specialist and mother of four, and her husband, an air traffic controller, weren’t receiving paychecks during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “That absolutely broke my heart,” James explained to CNN. “(I told him), ‘That is not for you to worry about.’ I was like, ‘No, whatever you want to do that day, that’s what we’re going to do.’ It hurt my feelings so bad that a coming 11-year-old was concerned about something he shouldn’t have to be concerned with.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s one of the agonizing conversations playing out in the homes of many federal employees across the country as they wait for the government to finally reopen.\n \n\n   \n  James, who is a representative of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, is one of 5,000 workers maintaining FAA equipment, along with 14,000 air traffic controllers, who are all working without a paycheck. This week, a small group of Senate Democrats voted  with Republicans  to  approve a funding measure  that could  end the longest shutdown in US history.  The measure now advances to the House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, a record number of air traffic controllers took unscheduled time off causing a cascading effect of hourslong delays for travelers. At the same time, the FAA slashed flights at 40 US airports, so controllers who do show up could safely handle the traffic.\n \n\n   \n  For James, who’s been at the FAA for over three years, when she saw news of a deal this week, she said, “I’ll believe it whenever I see it done.” James and her husband, a controller with the FAA for over 11 years, have been through shutdowns before, and have been saving in case another one should happen.\n \n\n   \n    Navigating a crisis within aviation\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the loss of pay for essential FAA employees a “crisis within aviation” as he spoke to reporters at Central Wisconsin Airport in Wausau, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the country from the James family, another married set of FAA employees, both controllers, share the hope that the shutdown ends this week. All of the family’s extra income has been “dumped” into a new home they are building for retirement. The couple, who wished to remain anonymous when discussing their jobs, are close to retirement age but not quite there yet.\n \n\n   \n  They have saved some money, but at one point it seemed like the shutdown was going to go on forever.\n \n\n   \n  “The worries of when it was going to end, because it didn’t look like there was any end in sight: we weren’t sure how that was going to pan out, but I don’t know,” the controller told CNN. “It’s not comforting.”\n \n\n   \n  They worked every day of the shutdown they could, but did take some time off when they were simply too exhausted to work.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is with air traffic controllers, the American people feel that probably most acutely when they’re not paid,” Duffy said. “A lot of them have taken leave. They’re not coming into towers. That has created significant disruption throughout aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy has said some controllers may be calling out in protest, while others could be working other jobs to support their family. Some simply get sick or become exhausted from the stress of not knowing when they will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “We are here to ensure that the flying public is safe and to continue maintaining those standards of safety,” James said. “The added stress of everything going on, you don’t want (that), and somebody who’s distracted mentally or emotionally or financially having to come to work.”\n \n\n   \n  Compounding the unscheduled time off due to the shutdown, it’s also cold and flu season, James said, and many people in her Atlanta facility cannot work right now due to illness.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump demanded Monday all controllers “get back to work, NOW” on Truth Social, recommending a bonus of $10,000 per controller who didn’t take time off during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But for the James family, they presumably won’t get bonuses since they did take time off when the family got sick.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to say we didn’t have to, but unfortunately, we both were sick and our kids got sick… If we hadn’t actually been sick, we would have been at work,” James said. “We don’t like calling out because that can increase the workload for others.”\n \n\n   \n    Making tough decisions for family\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference Tuesday afternoon at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said air traffic controllers will get most of their back pay shortly after funding resumes.\n \n\n   \n  “I mentioned I wanted air traffic controllers to come back to work,” Duffy said. “So to be clear, anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens, they are going to get … 70% of their pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The remaining 30% will come about a week later, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of banking (on the shutdown to end this week),” the controller who wishes to remain anonymous said. “I would have never thought in a million years – 40 something days – that we would have gone like that. It’s not something that’s not in the back of my mind.”\n \n\n   \n  The end to the shutdown can’t come soon enough for the James family either.\n \n\n   \n  It has caused her to put off a medical procedure she needed. Her insurance only partially covers it, she said, and it would take away thousands of dollars they need to survive should the shutdown continue.\n \n\n   \n  James and her husband, who met in the Army, are looking to foster a high school-aged girl, in addition to raising their four boys, and they won’t let the shutdown stop them from pursuing that. James is a licensed cosmetologist and said if the shutdown doesn’t wrap up this week, she’s going to talk to some salons to see what side work she can do on her days off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/doj-investigation-berkeley-turning-point-protests-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"05:34:00+00:00","title":"Justice Department Investigating UC Berkeley Protests During Turning Point USA Event","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department, including its Civil Rights Division and FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force, has launched a federal investigation into violent protests that occurred at a Turning Point USA event at the University of California, Berkeley on November 11, 2025.

is investigating protests that broke out at the University of California, Berkeley, this week during an event held by Turning Point USA, the group founded by slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk that caters to youth on American campuses.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters gathered hours before the event, with some seen in standoffs with lines of police. Several arrests were made by both city and university officers, according to UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof, who condemned any violence around the event.\n \n\n   \n  Both the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force and the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division will investigate what happened during the event Monday, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who oversees the Civil Rights Division.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation will involve “a deep dive into all the potential criminal and civil aspects of this horrific situation, including our concerns about UC Berkeley’s history of not protecting conservative speakers on its campus,” Dhillon said  on X , noting the UC Berkeley Police Department has been asked  to preserve all records  regarding its response at Monday’s event.\n \n\n   \n  The university is conducting its own investigation and will fully cooperate with federal authorities “to identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night’s TPUSA event,” Mogulof said in a statement Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no place at UC Berkeley for attempts to use violence or intimidation to prevent lawful expression or chill free speech,” Mogulof said.\n \n\n   \n  The university spokesperson noted the Turning Point event “proceeded safely and without interruption, with more than 900 participants in attendance.”\n \n\n   \n  At least three people were arrested Monday, the UC Berkeley police department and the city’s Berkeley Police Department told  CNN affiliate KGO . One of those was a student who was released after being cited. Another individual was charged with trespassing and obstruction, according to KGO.\n \n\n   \n  One man seen being taken into custody with a bloodied face was later identified by police as a victim and released. Witnesses told KGO the man was assaulted while selling Turning Point merchandise. Another man taken in custody at the same time was charged with robbery and battery, KGO reported.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to university and city police for more details.\n \n\n   \n  Both Dhillon and Bondi described the protests as violent and blamed  Antifa , the anti-fascism movement President Donald Trump  designated as a domestic terrorist organization  in September. Last month the DOJ brought its  first federal terrorism case  against alleged Antifa-aligned operatives.\n \n\n   \n  “The violent riots at UC Berkeley last night are under full investigation by the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force. We will continue to spare no expense unmasking all who commit and orchestrate acts of political violence,”  Bondi wrote  on X, describing Antifa as “an existential threat to our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  The president of Turning Point’s UC Berkeley chapter condemned the violence but acknowledged most protests on Monday were peaceful, according to KGO.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only a handful of incidents … but a handful of incidents is too many,” chapter president John Paul Leon said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/linda-sun-new-york-chinese-agent","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Former aide to two NY governors, accused of being Chinese agent, goes on trial for money laundering and fraud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Linda Sun, a former aide to New York governors Kathy Hochul and Andrew Cuomo, is set to go on trial in Brooklyn, New York, for allegedly acting as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party.

Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:09 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, Joe Jonas arrived at a taping of “Good Morning America” in New York looking a little bit like a high-school English teacher from 1998. His moss green zip-up Jacquemus sweater, worn atop a collared shirt and tie, with blue jeans and a Ford Mustang baseball cap, was a clunky collision of smart casual, but executed with a knowing wink.\n \n\n   \n  Ties, it seems, are no longer formal attire. Once they might have been reserved for weddings, funerals, business meetings, or galas; today they are being worn more liberally — and not necessarily with a suit. Just look at A$AP Rocky, who has been experimenting with styling the accessory in more playful ways. In one 2024 photo, he is seen pairing a Bottega Veneta pinstriped shirt with straight leg denim, a chunky patterned tie and a padded gilet. His counterparts are doing the same. Last May, fellow rapper Pusha T wore a Louis Vuitton tie and white shirt but eschewed the conventional tailored jacket for a zip-up leather hoodie.\n \n\n   \n  After surveying the street style of the attendees at Paris Fashion Week this year, GQ declared the tie was “so back.” Except this time, they looked looser — and often without a blazer in sight.\n \n\n   \n  You can blame Dior’s menswear show in June by Jonathan Anderson, the label’s creative director. Necks were a key focal point for Anderson here. His models’ decolletage was sometimes trussed up in silk cravats, or left entirely bare as they went shirtless under a jacket. When ties did pop up on the runway, they were styled  a la  naughty school boys — scrunched and worn inside-out, with careless half-popped collars.\n \n\n   \n  Anderson has also outfitted his roster of celebrity clients, who sit front row at his shows, in a similar way. A$AP Rocky wore his festive red and green tie asymmetrically over one collar, much like the sleepily dressed runway models — while British actors Josh O’Connor and Jonathan Bailey played it straight and stuck with convention. Bailey somewhat resembled a corporate tech bro, styling his tie with a shirt and blue Dior-logoed half-zip sweater.\n \n\n   \n  Men’s fashion preferences had been shifting away from neckties for several decades, driven by more casual dress codes in the workplace and a growing preference for comfort, even before the pandemic. In 2019, Hermès, best known for its silk accessories and leather handbags, reported slow growth in its silk and textiles unit for the previous year, with CEO Axel Dumas blaming the “structural decline” of neckties.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, journalist Jonah Weiner  wrote  in his menswear newsletter “Blackbird Spyplane” that his personal disdain for neckties came from the fact that, to him, they represented a “cursed Obama-era workplace cliche” and the “repressive gaze” of corporate overlords.\n \n\n   \n  When the workforce returned to their desks a year later, the tie didn’t always come with it: A photo of world leaders at the 2022 G7 summit circulated around the internet after people noticed that not one government representative — from former US President Joe Biden to President of France Emmanuel Macron — was wearing one. Gildo Zegna, chairman and chief executive of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group, shared a similar view when he  spoke  to the Business of Fashion that same year: “For the tie, I don’t see a good future.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, soon after, the tide changed. By 2023, GQ reported that neckties had become the hottest product at Hermès, as the brand developed new stylish options — some had more contemporary narrow widths; others were made from experimental fabrics like knit and even leather.\n \n\n   \n  Today, as changing social roles and gender equality ignites  conversations on what it means to be a man today , the adoption of the casual tie could be one response. Some critics see them as the modern-day codpiece (in the 16th century, the fabric pouch evolved from a practical modesty garment into a prominent fashion statement and symbol of masculinity). The phallic-shaped necktie, pointing like an arrow, directs attention from the wearer’s throat to groin as a masculine marker — which is why the recent spike in female wearers, including A-listers Zendaya, Mikey Madison, Iris Law, Madonna, Sabrina Carpenter, Hailey Bieber, Ayo Edibiri and Brooke Shields, is so powerful.\n \n\n   \n  Now, there are almost no rules on when to wear a tie. They can be worn with jeans, while running errands, under a sweatshirt or, if you are feeling old-school, to the office. The freedom to choose a tie, rather than feel mandated to wear one, makes the decision more creative. The Jonas brothers, who attended a red carpet premiere for their latest film just hours after their TV appearance Monday, each wore a suit. Ultimately they decided to skip the tie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/japan-takaichi-china-taiwan-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:52:00-05:00","title":"How Japan’s new prime minister has brought China’s ‘wolf warriors’ back out","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, the country’s first female leader, ignited a major diplomatic crisis with China by declaring in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would be a threat to Japan’s survival and could trigger a military response.

The conflict occurs against a backdrop of strained Japan-China relations, especially during the 80th anniversary of WWII’s end, when China held a major military parade and amplified anti-Japanese sentiment.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:52 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the end, there was no honeymoon period.\n \n\n   \n  Just two weeks ago,  Japan’s  new prime minister Sanae Takaichi was shaking hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, relations between the two Asian nations have dramatically soured, with escalating nationalist rhetoric in  China  and even an apparent threat of beheading from one of its diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi, who was elected as Japan’s  first female prime minister  just last month, has become embroiled in a growing row with Beijing over Taiwan – the democratic island that China’s ruling Communist Party claims as its own, and a red line  it has warned  other countries not to cross.\n \n\n   \n  The furor began when Takaichi  told the Japanese parliament  on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan – which lies just 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Japanese territory – would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival” and could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of the island and has ramped up the frequency and complexity of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “ strategic ambiguity .”\n \n\n   \n  Wading into the thorny issue of Taiwan’s defense has gotten other world leaders in hot water with Beijing before. Former US President Joe Biden set off a diplomatic panic during his time in office when he  said multiple times  that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan – forcing the White House to repeatedly walk back his comments, and sparking anger each time in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s remarks were met with an even more vehement response.\n \n\n   \n  “The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” wrote the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  The fallout has  spiraled  since, with Japan criticizing Xue’s “extremely inappropriate” post and Taiwan voicing concern about Xue’s “threatening” remarks, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, meanwhile, has defended its position and Xue’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry on Monday accused Japan of “grossly interfering with China’s internal affairs,” saying Xue’s post was simply responding to Takaichi’s “erroneous and dangerous remarks.”\n \n\n   \n  For some, the controversy harks back to China’s “ wolf warrior ” diplomacy – an aggressive style of foreign policy that emerged in the early 2020s, which often saw Chinese officials take to social media platforms to hit back directly - and often colorfully - at any criticism of China, but has since been dialed back as Beijing looked to win back lost goodwill among Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  And within China, where there is already significant streak of anti-Japanese sentiment, state media and other prominent voices this week have further fanned outrage over Takaichi’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily condemned Takaichi as “recklessly shooting her mouth off,” and warning: “No one should harbor any illusion that they can cross the line on the Taiwan issue without paying a price.”\n \n\n   \n  A social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV asked: “Has her head been kicked by a donkey?”\n \n\n   \n  Hu Xijin, a Chinese pundit and former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times, offered a more violent warning, echoing the threats from the diplomat Xue.\n \n\n   \n  “China’s battle blade for beheading invaders has been sharpened to a very keen edge,” he wrote in a post on Tuesday. “If Japanese militarism wishes to come to the Taiwan Strait to sacrifice themselves on our blades, we will fulfill them.”\n \n\n   \n    A tangled relationship\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi said Monday that her comments were “hypothetical,” and said she would avoid making similar comments in parliament again. But the prime minister is walking a  tightrope  every Japanese leader has had to balance.\n \n\n   \n  China remains Japan’s largest trading partner, and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes.  At the same time, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative views, like her mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity and criticized Beijing’s growing military presence in the region.\n \n\n   \n  This uneasy relationship was on display when  Takaichi met Xi  at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October. The two leaders agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship,” Takaichi said afterward; however, she also raised with Xi the hot-button issue of China’s activity in the East China Sea, including around islands claimed by both countries.\n \n\n   \n  Even before she took office, Takaichi’s stance on Taiwan was clear. She visited the island earlier this year and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. During the APEC summit, she also met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  The current spat comes during a year when Japan-China relations are already strained, in part because of Tokyo’s colonial and war-time past.\n \n\n   \n  September marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Beijing commemorated with a  massive military parade . There’s longstanding historical hostility between the two countries; China was a crucial Allied partner, fighting against Japan’s full-scale invasion that ended only with Tokyo’s formal surrender in 1945.\n \n\n   \n  The scars of that era run deep. Japanese Imperial troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the  Nanjing Massacre  – one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the parade, Chinese officials ramped up their rhetoric and accused Japan of whitewashing history. Adding fuel to the fire, China also released at least  four WWII films this year,  including some that depict the Nanjing Massacre and the sinking of a Japanese vessel.\n \n\n   \n  Fearing a spike in anti-Japanese sentiment ahead of the parade, the Japanese embassy in Beijing warned its citizens to stay cautious and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public – perhaps mindful that in recent years, there has been a spate of  violent attacks  against  Japanese nationals in China .\n \n\n   \n  That complex history involves Taiwan, too.\n \n\n   \n  The island was once a Japanese colony that Imperial China had ceded to Imperial Japan. After Japan was defeated in WWII, China’s ruling Nationalists took control of Taiwan – then, several years later, fled to the island and moved their seat of government there after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n \n\n   \n  Today, the CCP views the self-ruling island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary. Party leaders and state media have repeatedly claimed that the end of WWII marked the island’s return to Chinese rule and liberation from Japanese occupation – a view Chinese officials alluded to this week as they berated Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan holds historical responsibility towards the Chinese people regarding the Taiwan issue, having committed unmentionable crimes during the 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan,” said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday when asked about Takaichi’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Eighty years ago, we defeated the Japanese aggressors, restored Taiwan, and ended their occupation and plunder,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Should anyone again attempt to challenge China’s core interests” or thwart reunification with Taiwan, Chen said, Beijing “will never accept or tolerate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-economy-white-house-strategy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"White House Weighs Stepped Up Domestic Travel and Speeches to Improve Trump’s Standing on the Economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s advisers are considering increased domestic travel and economy-focused speeches to improve public perception of economic performance amid growing public anxiety about inflation and affordability.

economy \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  advisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president has  bristled at in public : Americans’ outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration’s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren’t resonating.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t convince people that their experience, what they’re feeling at home, isn’t reality,” one of the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed by  rising prices , they said. They have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on Trump’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans’ economic anxiety are “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there’s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs.\n \n\n   \n  Two key factors last week — Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown — initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,” Trump said, responding to the criticism that  he was too busy meeting with foreign leaders . “But with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans’ perception of his administration’s handling of the economy and the media’s coverage of it.\n \n\n   \n  “The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official said. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing,” pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  acknowledged  that frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they were  getting “killed” politically  by the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It appears the shutdown could be over by week’s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed another  potential political liability  for the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week’s votes to reopen the government.)\n \n\n   \n    ‘We have the greatest economy ever’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed during Monday’s Fox News interview about why Americans say they’re down on the economy if he’s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,” Trump said. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In a  CNN poll  released last week, 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.)\n \n\n   \n  Some of the president’s defensive messaging has come from what he’s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They’ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. “The President’s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation — and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump — he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Trump’s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats’ affordability message as a “con job,” he’s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He’s floated  $2,000 tariff rebate checks  to lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he’s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with).\n \n\n   \n  All of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath.\n \n\n   \n  And while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week’s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden’s mistakes, which means taking Americans’ perceptions about the economy seriously — and doing something about it.\n \n\n   \n  With critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump’s term now less than a year away, they don’t see time to waste.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97700","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:53:00-05:00","title":"We were gone far too long.

The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\" He kept his word but   tensions were high when members returned this week. \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\" After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in. \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\" Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks. \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.   But  Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office  throughout the shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\" Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of  Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year  – the crux of the shutdown itself. \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\" Other GOP members, like  Missouri Rep. Mark Alford , said the time back home was useful. \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\" Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place. \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas. She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat   Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown. Grijalva told NPR's  All Things Considered   she thinks her support of the  effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files  played a role in her wait to get seated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I really like this lady. She's going to be an excellent member of Congress,\" Speaker Johnson  said   after he swore Grijalva in . \"We followed the custom of the House on the timetable and we've had a little, as we say in the deep South, some intense fellowship about that. But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\" Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month. \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\" Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\" Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that. \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\" Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills. \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/redistricting-trump-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s 2026 redistricting scheme could wind up hurting democracy more than Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's strategy to push red states into creating more GOP-leaning congressional districts has sparked a political arms race, but the outcomes are not as favorable for Republicans as anticipated.

Trump’s 2026 redistricting scheme could wind up hurting democracy more than Democrats \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump marched the nation into a historic redistricting arms race with his brazen move to get red states to draw as many new GOP-leaning districts as possible.\n \n\n   \n  Already, more states have voluntarily redrawn their congressional maps in the middle of a decade than had done so  in the last half-century combined .\n \n\n   \n  And it was an arms race the  GOP was always likely to win , given the power dynamics involved.\n \n\n   \n  But four months into the battle, the GOP’s gains are looking relatively muted. Indeed, it’s looking like Trump’s move could be much more damaging to democracy — by normalizing these kinds of bare-knuckle political tactics for years to come — than to the Democratic Party in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Appropriately enough for the Trump era, the biggest victim here could wind up being our political norms.\n \n\n   \n  While much remains to be determined, Democrats have benefited from a series of positive developments in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The big one, of course, was the easy passage last week of a California ballot measure that allows the party to  draw five new Democratic-leaning districts  in that state. Gov. Gavin Newsom launched that effort to offset the GOP’s gains in Texas, the state where Trump and the GOP started this war. And California voters overwhelmingly agreed (65%-35%) that retaliation was warranted.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have also benefited from a new compromise  map in Ohio that  wasn’t as bad for them  as it could have been, along with the  reluctance of Republicans in some red states  to heed Trump’s call to squeeze every district they can out of the process.\n \n\n   \n  The election results last week were also positive for Democrats in a few subtler ways.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Democrats greatly expanded their advantage in the Virginia House of Delegates and swept the state’s executive offices, which should help them press forward with drawing more Democratic-leaning districts.\n \n\n   \n  For two, the big swings toward Democrats from the 2024 elections might give Republicans pause about trying to draw too many more favorable districts. The more you draw, after all, the more it spreads your voters thin and risks your districts getting swept up in a wave election for the other side. (Want an example of how that can work?  See: the 1894 election .)\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight is such a blowout so far that I wonder if it gives some Rs pause about redistricting in states that are still pondering it,” Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics  said on X  on election night.\n \n\n   \n  And then came perhaps the most pleasant surprise of all for Democrats, on Monday in Utah. A federal judge threw out a Republican-drawn map and adopted an alternate one that gave Democrats  a new safely blue seat in Salt Lake City .\n \n\n   \n  So where does all this leave us? CNN’s elections team has  a great new tracker  where you can monitor it all.\n \n\n   \n  All told, Republicans have added an estimated nine new GOP targets in Texas, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri, while Democrats have added about six in California and Utah.\n \n\n   \n  The big questions from here are what happens in Florida and Virginia, where each side could gain three or more seats — Republicans in the former and Democrats in the latter. And seats could be in play for one side or the other in Indiana and Kansas (for Republicans) and Illinois and Maryland (for Democrats).\n \n\n   \n  We don’t yet know how that will shake out. Legal challenges loom over some of the states that have already moved or could move. Another major question is whether the Supreme Court opens the door to even more aggressive gerrymandering by striking down part of the Voting Rights Act — a move that could completely change the game in the South and  give Republicans a major advantage . That would likely impact elections held after 2026.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s entirely possible that, for 2026, Republicans could wind up netting about three to five seats total from this exercise. That’s where we’d be if every other state that’s in play actually followed through.\n \n\n   \n  And the GOP’s gains could be even less than that when you factor in how competitive some of these seats could be in a Democratic-leaning election, as  the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman notes .\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Democrats’ gains with Hispanic voters in last week’s elections make the Texas GOP’s hopes of winning two of the five new Republican-leaning districts look more tenuous. The GOP was banking on  maintaining Trump’s big gains with Hispanic voters in 2024 , but that’s looking like a not-so-great bet right now.\n \n\n   \n  And if the GOP nets only three to five seats, that’s likely to have negligible impact on who controls the House after the 2026 elections. That’s because the party that doesn’t hold the White House usually wins lots of seats in midterm elections — more than enough to cover the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Without any redistricting changes, Democrats need to flip three seats. A GOP gain of three to five seats would stretch that to Democrats needing to flip between six and eight seats.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition party has failed to win that many seats only nine times since the Civil War, and not once since 2002, according to  data from the Brookings Institution .\n \n\n   \n  Throw Trump’s significant unpopularity on top of that, and it appears unlikely that his redistricting gambit will ultimately do what he wanted: prevent Democrats from controlling the House for the president’s two final years in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what Trump will have done is saddle the country with a new political reality in which each side is tempted to redraw districts whenever it’s advantageous and  we get fewer and fewer competitive districts , as Kondik wrote last week.\n \n\n   \n  That’s something the American people  decidedly did not want . But it would be part of Trump’s norm-busting legacy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5407493","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00.000Z","title":"The U.S. Just Produced Its Last Penny After a More Than 200-Year Run","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Mint has produced its final penny on November 12, 2025, ending a 232-year tradition that began in 1793.

The government decided to stop making new pennies because each one costs nearly 4 cents to produce.  The move is expected to save about $56 million a year.  If you have a jar of pennies on your dresser, or a few stuck in your couch cushions, don't worry. They're still perfectly legal for making payments. But of the more than $1 billion worth of pennies in circulation, most never circulate. And it was costing the government a lot of money to keep making more of them.  Some restaurants and retailers are  already struggling with a shortage of pennies .  The phase-out may require businesses to round prices up or down to the nearest nickel, although the growing popularity of non-cash payments makes that less of a headache.  Fewer than one in five payments  are made with cash, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.   Canada, New Zealand and Australia have also eliminated their one-cent coins.  The penny was introduced in 1793 The U.S. began minting pennies in 1793, the year after Congress authorized the Mint. President Abraham Lincoln was the first president to be featured on a coin, starting in 1909, the centennial of his birth.  Carl Sandberg wrote at the time, \"The common, homely face of \"Honest Abe\" will look good on the penny, the coin of the common folk from whom he came and to whom he belongs.\" But Lincoln is also on $5 bill.  Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., suggested during a hearing earlier this year that phasing out the penny could increase demand for nickels. Minting nickels is also a money-loser for the government, since the five-cent coins cost about 14 cents each.  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers that the administration believes it can break even on nickel production by changing the composition of the coins.  \"I will point out that the dime is very profitable,\" the secretary added.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   There's a big change coming to some small change. The Treasury Department says it's soon planning to stop minting pennies. The copper-colored coins have been in production for more than 200 years, but cash of all kinds is less popular for making payments today. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now with his two cents on this. Scott, so why is the Treasury Department making this move? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, A. It does seem like a big move. The federal government's been minting pennies since 1793, but the coins have become a money-loser. Each one costs almost 4 cents to make, and the government makes billions of them. So by phasing out the penny, the Treasury Department says it expects to save about $56 million a year in material costs, and it hopes to pinch even more pennies down the road through more efficient operations at the mint. MARTÍNEZ: All right, so what's going to happen to all the pennies that are on my - that are on my cabinet? HORSLEY: Yeah, they're - don't worry. They're still legal tender, and that is a relief to you and others because there are an estimated 114 billion pennies out there in the economy. But most don't really circulate. They just sit around gathering dust, like... (SOUNDBITE OF PENNIES RATTLING) HORSLEY: ...The ones I keep... MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter). HORSLEY: ...In the Don Francisco coffee can on my dresser. And, frankly, that's part of the problem, A. Most people don't use the pennies they already have, so the pennies don't change hands. Then stores have to go to the bank and ask for more pennies to make change, and the government has to keep minting them. MARTÍNEZ: So what will businesses do when they can't get more pennies from the government? HORSLEY: Well, they might have to round prices up or down a little bit. You know, maybe we'll see fewer price tags that say $1.99 or 19.99. Luckily, we do have some experience with this. Other countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand phased out their 1-cent coins years ago, and it turns out it's not really a big deal. Keep in mind, more and more people are now using forms of payment other than cash, whether that's credit cards, debit cards or a smartphone app. And according to the Federal Reserve, even for small purchases, under $25 now, shoppers are equally likely to pay with a credit card or a debit card as they are with cash. MARTÍNEZ: Maybe we can get pennies from heaven... HORSLEY: (Laughter) MARTÍNEZ: ...Instead of from the government. That could be another option. Let's just put a pin on that one. So, OK, is getting rid of pennies a step forward maybe toward getting rid of cash altogether? HORSLEY: Probably not - at least not anytime soon. Cash is still used for about 14% of all payments, according to the Fed. Not surprisingly, older people and lower-income families are more likely to use cash than younger, wealthier customers. Whatever your age or income, though, if you start fishing around for a lot of pennies in the checkout line, you're probably going to get some nasty looks from other customers or the cashier. I should mention, pennies are not the only coin the government loses money on. It costs about 14 cents to mint a nickel, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a House committee earlier this month he does think there is a way to break even on those. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT BESSENT: We have looked at this, and we believe that it is possible by changing the composition of the nickel to bring down the cost to 5 cents or less. HORSLEY: And Bessent says the government still makes a profit on dimes. MARTÍNEZ: Is ditching the penny a dig at Abraham Lincoln? HORSLEY: Luckily, Lincoln still has the $5 bill. He was actually the first president to be featured on a coin back in 1909, which was the centennial of his birth. Of course, it was Ben Franklin who said a penny saved is a penny earned, or words to that effect. Franklin's face is on the hundred-dollar bill, and those aren't going anywhere. MARTÍNEZ: Scott, I'd offer you a penny for your thoughts. It costs too much, so just a thank you. That's NPR's Scott Horsley. HORSLEY: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/white-house-website-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"How the Trump administration seeks to ‘weaponize’ the White House website to troll Democrats and amplify its message","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has transformed the official White House website (whitehouse.gov) into a political weapon, using it to troll Democrats through memes, false claims, and misleading timeline edits.

Democrats and amplify its message \n       \n  By Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In 2000, President Bill Clinton made an  “Internet Address”  celebrating new changes to the White House website that his administration launched just a few years earlier. Intended to be a source of government information for Americans and a connection to the White House from their homes, Clinton stressed that leaders have the responsibility to use tools like the website “to expand the reach of democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve made the website a permanent part of the Executive Office of the President, so that future presidents will be able to change it to suit their needs as easily as they can change the furniture here in the Oval Office,” Clinton said.\n \n\n   \n  Twenty-five years later, President Donald Trump has done  far more   than just   swap out   the furniture , and the sound of construction is not unusual on White House grounds. The aggressive remodel has extended online, where the second Trump administration has transformed the government website into a tool to troll Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a timer on the White House website tracks how long “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government” down to the second, even as Senate Democrats joined with Republicans on Monday to advance a funding measure. A  “mysafespace”  webpage, in the style of the early 2000s site MySpace, mocks Democrats and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, dubbing him “Sombrero Guy” and “Dollar Store Obama,” while claiming his heroes are “transnational gangs, illegal immigrants” and radical leftists.\n \n\n   \n   And amid public outrage over  Trump’s demolition of the East Wing  for his new ballroom, the administration has added several controversial, and in some cases mischaracterized, intervals to a timeline of White House construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We use it to really drive a message,” a White House official said. “The website is informative in a lot of different ways, but it’s also a vehicle to push our message, and we’re able to weaponize it in a way that no other administration has been able to do.”\n \n\n   \n  But while the second Trump administration’s  social media strategy  has long embraced memes and videos mocking Democrats, former White House officials are raising concerns about the irreverent approach bleeding over to a website previously geared toward historical and informational ends.\n \n\n   \n  And that uproar is part of the White House’s intention – to spread its message further.\n \n\n   \n  “The outrage on the left is great because they’re just consumed with it,” the White House official said. “It’s great for our base, because they’re able to take a screenshot or a snippet of the timeline and post it on social media.”\n \n\n   \n    Following Trump’s lead\n \n\n   \n  The digital strategy under the Trump administration, the White House official said, is to not only follow the president’s lead but to amplify it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s spitballing with ideas on the fly. I mean, a lot of it is what we say, ‘Follow the leader,’ which is what President Trump has done on social media, and just amplify it. And, you know, try to take it to the next level,” they said, pointing to the sombrero memes.\n \n\n   \n  What began with Trump resharing an AI-generated  racist and vulgar video  of Jeffries in a sombrero alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the White House morphed into taunts on social media to increase the size of the sombrero until the shutdown ends. And the meme has now crossed over to the White House website, where on the “mysafespace” page, dozens of sombreros appear in the background, and mariachi music starts playing when users hit the play button.\n \n\n   \n  It pairs with an “About me” section that claims Democrats “couldn’t care less if our men and women in uniform get paid or if our neighborhoods are safe – we just love playing politics with people’s livelihoods.” And if users click on an option for “Contacting Hakeem,” the White House website generates a draft email to Jeffries’ and Schumer’s offices with prewritten text asking to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether there are any lines the White House isn’t willing to cross, the official said, “There’s certainly lines.”\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t do anything that’s overtly political, right? You can’t run afoul of the Hatch Act,” they said, referring to legislation that  prohibits the federal government  and its employees, except for the president and vice president, from “engaging in partisan political activity,” including on social media. The official added, “We’re doing everything within the framework of what’s allowable.”\n \n\n   \n  The aggressive approach strikes David Almacy, former White House internet and e-communications director under President George W. Bush’s administration, as a significant shift from past presidencies.\n \n\n   \n  Almacy said he viewed whitehouse.gov as a way to keep Americans apprised on what the president was doing on a daily basis, contribute to a larger historical record of the president’s entire term and provide “an accurate historical and factual record of the White House as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was very sort of like nondescript, the headlines. There was no political tone to it,” he recalled, adding the Bush administration tried to “adhere to the spirit of the Hatch Act.” “It was never derogatory. It was never meant to divide. It was meant to inform.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think now it appears that mostly it’s being used as a political tool,” Almacy said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Everybody is more unfiltered’\n \n\n   \n  It’s “an outdated view,” a Republican digital operative familiar with the Trump administration’s digital efforts said, to think of the White House website as somewhere that a grade-school student goes to cite a paper, given “there are far more comprehensive historical resources.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not about party. Everybody is more online. Everybody is more unfiltered. Everybody is more human sounding and authentic, and websites don’t sound like press releases anymore,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  But former officials who worked on the White House website in past administrations say that the official government website should be a trusted and reliable resource, not be a place for mischaracterizing the truth and taking cheap shots at the opposing party.\n \n\n   \n  “Citizens need to be able to rely on whitehouse.gov, and that public trust in government breaks down when there’s information that is politically motivated, especially in contexts that are meant to be historically grounded versus an administration’s individual priorities and issues,” Ashleigh Axios, a former creative director within the Office of Digital Strategy in the Obama administration, said in an interview with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to edits to the  White House’s “About” page  amid outrage over the East Wing demolition as “a misuse of whitehouse.gov and a misuse of government properties.”\n \n\n   \n  This includes a picture marking Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the “Major Events Timeline” – part of several additions, including “Cocaine Discovered,”  falsely linking  former President Joe Biden’s son Hunter to cocaine found at the White House in 2023; a “Muslim Brotherhood Visit” under the Obama administration, which misleadingly uses a pre-presidency photo of Obama in Somali dress during a visit to Kenya; and the establishment of a  “Trans Day of Visibility”  under Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We called it internally the ‘Easter eggs’ to see if anyone would find it,” the Trump White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The timeline additions, which the official said pointed out hypocrisy, are unrelated to other items detailing construction projects at the White House. Key context is left out; photos misrepresent the facts and the new highlighted events clearly target Democratic administrations. On the page, the “East Wing Expansion Stages” are explained, but its demolition isn’t.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for TMZ to write up the changes to the timeline, which White House communications director Steven Cheung reposted on X, writing, “HAHAHAHAHA!”\n \n\n   \n  The timeline stood out to Axios, the Obama administration official, who posted  on LinkedIn , “Misinformation has no place on the White House website.”\n \n\n   \n  “WhiteHouse.gov isn’t just another website,” she said. “It’s the digital front door of the presidency.”\n \n\n   \n  But to White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr, the additions to the timeline are just “unfortunate truths.” And he hinted more to come.\n \n\n   \n  “These are truths. There is no misinformation. If  WhiteHouse.gov  is the front door of a presidency then our site is a reflection of the most innovative and communicative President in history. The facts will continue. The memes will continue. Enjoy :),” Dorr  posted on X  in response to Axios.\n \n\n   \n  Macon Phillips, the former director of digital strategy at the White House in the Obama era, argued that the Trump administration’s provocative approach should be ignored. He characterized the strategy as a distraction from real issues facing Americans, like  rising health care premiums  – the key sticking point for Democrats during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Red herring is when they used to take spoiled fish and drag it across the field to get the hounds off the scent of the fox,” Phillips said. “This strategy that they have is meant to get us talking about this, instead of the fact that health insurance premiums in Vermont, where I live, are about to be gutted and people are going to die.”\n \n\n   \n    An evolving digital landscape\n \n\n   \n  While no previous administration has used the White House website quite as aggressively as the Trump administration, some digital teams have gotten in hot water for certain content posted on the site.\n \n\n   \n  Obama’s second-term digital team  once faced backlash  for adding content to former presidential biographies that tied to the administration’s initiatives at the time, while the Bush administration’s digital team couldn’t hyperlink to sites outside of .gov and .mil., even nonprofits, like the Red Cross.\n \n\n   \n  “Links to private media outlets with advertising, one could argue, could financially benefit those outlets if they write positive coverage,” Almacy, the Bush administration official, recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “Our rules were pretty strict,” he added, noting how social media changed the digital landscape. “Now, it seems like it’s off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican digital operative said in his view, the biography of Trump on the Biden White House website “reads a little political.”\n \n\n   \n  The Biden-era  White House website  factually includes Trump’s impeachments; the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot; the death count during the coronavirus pandemic; and the late 2018 government shutdown. But it also lists his achievements on signing a major tax reform law and moving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Almacy also recalled tone shifts on the Obama website,  like a 2010 blog post , where the administration wrote, “The President blasts Republicans in the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  But he questioned how Republicans would react if the Obama administration made similar politically motivated additions to the “Major Events Timeline.” After years of working on the website, he said he doesn’t visit it anymore.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s imagine that Barack Obama posted things on white house.gov that were just completely derogatory and accusatory and attacking of Republicans. How do you think the Republicans would take that?” Almacy said. “This is the precedent that’s being set.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, which are live music performances hosted by NPR's Tiny Desk series, showcasing artists performing in a simple, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Live Music","Music Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607812","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"The government shutdown is over, but not everything is back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a 43-day government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — the federal government officially reopened on November 13, 2025, following a bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.

is officially over after President  Trump signed a bill  passed by Congress on Wednesday night. The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday. \"Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner\" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a  Wednesday memo . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The timing of backpay is a different question. After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress  passed a law  ensuring back pay for federal workers \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\" But Trump appeared to  suggest otherwise  in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were  paused by a federal judge , and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January. Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an  Instagram video  that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days. \"Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,\" he says of the last shutdown. \"A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.\" SNAP is back  The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026. The program, which some  42 million Americans rely on  for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and  extended that pause again  on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight). At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as  NPR has reported , many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again. Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual. Its  website says  the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday. All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved  live animal cams  — will reopen to the public \"on a rolling basis\" by Monday. Air travel won't bounce back overnight The shutdown snarled air travel in a tangle that experts say is beyond a quick fix. Escalating shortages of air traffic controllers — who have been required to work without pay — caused delays and disruptions at airports nationwide since early October. Then, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to  reduce air traffic  at 40 of the country's busiest airports, starting by 4% and ramping up to 10% by this Friday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The FAA  announced Wednesday  that it would freeze flight reductions at the current 6% level, citing a rapid improvement in controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers will get a lump sum payment equal to 70% of their  back pay within 48 hours  of the shutdown ending. The agency says it will continue to assess \"whether the system can gradually return to normal operations.\" Airlines and aviation regulators have warned that flight  disruptions are likely to continue  once the government reopens. Airlines had to adjust their schedules to reduce flights, and those changes can take time to reverse. \"It's going to take a bit to unwind, and the responsibility is not going to fall completely on the air traffic control operation,\" former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt  told NPR's  All Things Considered  on Tuesday. \"A good deal of responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying.\" Air travel experts have told NPR that even after the shutdown, lingering impacts could potentially complicate  Thanksgiving travel  — which is always a hectic time to fly. National Parks start to \"pick up the pieces\"     Most national parks  stayed at least partially open  during the shutdown, but with significantly reduced staffing (since thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed) and limited services like visitor centers and trash pickup. The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit that advocates for national parks,  said in a statement  that it could take months for returning staff to address the damage. \"For 43 days, many national parks were left open, vulnerable and unprotected,\" said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA. \"The National Park Service, already pushed to its breaking point after losing 25% of permanent staff, is left to pick up the pieces.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       National parks were already feeling the strain before the shutdown,  forced by federal funding cuts  to cancel ranger programs, close visitors centers and pause maintenance and research. During the shutdown, parks were unable to collect millions of dollars in entrance and recreational fees, which Brengel says could delay construction projects and other visitor services. And nonprofits which diverted resources to help parks stay operational have depleted their budgets in the process, Brengel says, leaving them \"unsure if they will ever fully recover those funds.\" Congress' bill funds the National Park Service through January. But Brengel calls it \"only a short-term reprieve,\" warning that another government shutdown could dampen the busy season by affecting the hiring of seasonal rangers for next spring and summer. The IRS is looking ahead to tax filing season The IRS  furloughed nearly half  of its approximately 74,000 workers and tried to lay off  roughly 1,400 others  — though those cuts were reversed as a result of the bill reopening the government. The agency's operations were  limited during the shutdown . It generally did not pay tax refunds during this period, scaled back its live telephone customer service supports, closed walk-in Taxpayer Assistance Centers and cancelled appointments related to cases with the Independent Office of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate Service — which it says will be rescheduled once the government reopens. Tax deadlines and laws remain in effect, and the IRS says it has continued critical operations related to next year's tax-filing season. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But some experts worry that the effects of the shutdown — on top of thousands of  IRS job cuts  enacted earlier this year — could make for a messy 2026 tax season. In an  October letter  to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) urged the IRS to take steps like pausing notice and collection activities during the shutdown. It wrote that since taxpayers can only respond to those by mail, the understaffed agency may not see their letters in time to fix errors or address issues — and will have to deal with an unwieldy backlog when the government reopens. \"This burden has the real potential to delay the 2026 filing season due to the increased stresses to our entire tax system,\" the accountants wrote. Such disruptions have happened before. The 2018-2019 shutdown left the IRS with over 5 million pieces of unprocessed mail, 80,000 unaddressed responses to Fiscal Year 2018 Earned Income Tax Credit audits and 87,000 amended returns waiting to be processed,  according to a report  by the National Taxpayer Advocate (an independent agency within the IRS). And years earlier, the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 delayed billions of dollars of tax refunds and created a backlog of 1.2 million income and Social Security number verification requests, according to the  Committee for a Responsible Budget . Delayed economic reports may never be released The shutdown could leave permanent gaps in economic data. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases employment reports on the first Friday of each month, a practice that was paused in October and November. Even with the government reopening, their future is uncertain. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt  told reporters  on Wednesday that October's inflation and jobs reports will \"likely never [be] released and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired.\" She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said \"may have permanently damaged the federal statistical system.\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not commented publicly on the status of the reports or updated its calendar of upcoming release dates. Economists  expect the bureau  to release its September jobs report (which was nearly ready when the government shut down on Oct. 1) first, and say it's an open question when — or whether — any October reports will be published. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978652","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"United Nations Recognizes Right to Development as Global Standard","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations General Assembly has formally recognized the right to development, affirming it as a fundamental human right.

Someone who – simply through good conversation – gets you to open up? Makes you feel smarter, more interesting or just understood?  These are all common traits of \"supercommunicators\" — people who are consistently able to create authentic connections with others just by listening and talking. They're the topic of a new book published this month,  Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection , by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg.  You don't need a specific personality type — like being outgoing or chatty — to be an effective conversationalist, says Duhigg in his book. \"It's just a set of skills that anyone can learn,\" like asking deep questions or being vulnerable.   \n       \n      Related Story:  Oops, I messed up! 7 common public speaking issues — and how to fix them \n       You'll want to master these skills, he says, because they can help you bond with others in \"a profound way that makes life so much more meaningful.\" In fact, studies have shown that when people have positive personal relationships and feel connected to their communities – a feat made possible through good communication – they tend to  have happier, healthier and longer lives .  Duhigg, who drew on scientific research, psychology and interviews with people whose jobs rely on communication (like executives and spies) to write his book, shares four habits of supercommunicators.  1. They know what kind of conversation they're having One key trait of supercommunicators is that they know what kind of conversation they're having — and are therefore able to respond accordingly, says Duhigg. Generally, conversations tend to fall into three categories.  Practical conversations:  Let's say you are talking to a friend who is complaining about work. If you were having a practical conversation, your friend might ask you to help problem-solve and make hard decisions. They may ask straightforward questions like, \"What do you think I should do about my boss?\" If you're in this type of conversation, be ready to give good advice.   Emotional conversations:  People engaging in these types of discussions are seeking empathy, not answers, says Duhigg. If your friend who is complaining about work is expressing their feelings and saying things like, \"I'm so frustrated this is happening!\" or \"my work environment is so stressful!\" you may want to show your support by being a good listener.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Good conversations take time and attention. Here's how to have better ones  \n       Social conversations:  Any time you're, say, gossiping about office politics, discussing relationships with friends or sharing how your family background influences your identity, you're having a social conversation. These discussions reflect \"how we see others and how other people see us,\" says Duhigg. If you're in this type of dialogue, be mindful of the different perspectives each person brings to the table and seek common ground.  2. They 'prove' they're listening There are plenty of ways to  appear  like you're listening, says Duhigg, like making eye contact or nodding intently. But  proving  to someone that you're listening is the quickest road to making someone feel heard. To do that, he suggests a technique called \"looping for understanding .\"  First, ask someone a question and then listen to their response. Next, repeat back in your own words what they just told you. Lastly – and this is the step that people usually forget, he says – ask your conversation partner if you got what they said correct.  This practice might sound fairly simple, but it packs a big punch, says Duhigg. \"When we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak,\" he says. So if you can show someone you genuinely want to understand them, it creates trust — even if you both completely disagree with each other.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How to have tricky conversations \n       3. They ask (a lot of) the right questions  Research shows that highly effective communicators tend to ask  10 to 20 times  as many questions as everyone else. They may simply be follow-up questions that signal to the other person that you're interested in the conversation, like \"So did you make it on time?\" or \"What happened next?\"  Supercommunicators also ask questions that get people to open up. Duhigg calls these \"deep questions.\" They \"ask about people's values, beliefs or experiences\" and \"spark an opportunity for emotional connection.\"  This might sound overly intimate, especially if you're talking to a stranger, but he says it doesn't have to be. Be intentional with your framing and take time to think of \"the real question instead of the rote question.\"  Let's say you've met an acquaintance at a party. Instead of just asking what they do for a living, ask, \"Do you love what you do?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Want to listen better? Turn down your thoughts and tune in to others \n       When in doubt, Duhigg says to just ask \"why.' Generally, people love to talk about how they see the world. \"What I've found is that within three questions you can get to something real if you ask 'why,' \" he says. \"And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from.\" 4. They aim to understand For a supercommunicator, the goal of a discussion isn't to impress someone, convince someone or wait for their turn to speak, says Duhigg. It's to genuinely comprehend someone else's point of view and share their own views  accordingly.  Let's say you mention to your co-worker that you're stressed about your childcare situation. Many people might breeze past an emotional comment, feign curiosity or offer empty platitudes. But a supercommunicator would sit with the emotion you offer them. They might ask you a deep question about your situation and then offer a story about some of their own struggles at home.  This kind of response, says Duhigg, creates an atmosphere of trust, vulnerability and openness that both parties can benefit from. It says, \"if you know I want to understand you, you're going to want to understand me.\"  \"And that is actually the most magical thing that can happen,\" he adds.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Hey there. Stacey Vanek Smith here in for Marielle Segarra. When you are having a bad day, who do you call? Who is that person who makes you feel better, maybe someone who really listens to you? I'm guessing there's a name or a face that's popped into your mind right now. CHARLES DUHIGG: Yeah. Me, too. I think everyone listening probably has someone. And for you, that person is a supercommunicator. And you're probably a supercommunicator back to them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANEK SMITH: Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the bestselling author of \"The Power Of Habit.\" His new book, \"Supercommunicators,\" is a guide to how to unlock the secret language of connection. The secret to real, authentic connection? I mean, it's not such a big secret. We have all had those amazing conversations at one time or another, felt that buzz when your ideas are really in sync with a colleague, or that amazing feeling when you have a conversation with your partner and you feel like they really get you. DUHIGG: But there are some people who can do this more consistently with basically anyone. And what we've learned is that it's not an inborn trait. It's not that introverts can do it better than extroverts or vice versa. Rather, there are some people who have just paid a little bit more attention to how they communicate with other people and how others communicate with them. VANEK SMITH: And those people, those supercommunicators, they're the people for whom doors of opportunity often open up a lot more readily, people who build and maintain genuine connections, says Charles. They live longer, happier, fuller lives. And all it takes to start is some authentic conversation. DUHIGG: Listening to their own instincts and saying, the goal of this discussion ought to be not to impress you, not to make you think I'm smart, not to convince you that I'm right. The goal of this conversation should be to understand you. And if you know that I want to understand you, you're going to want to understand me. And that is actually the most magical thing that can happen. VANEK SMITH: In this episode of LIFE KIT, we take a look at how to be a supercommunicator. Reporter Andee Tagle talks to Charles Duhigg about connection, conversation, and the power of asking good questions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE: Charles, let's talk a little bit about the power of connection. I think everyone would agree that it's nice to have a nice conversation, but that's different than real, meaningful connection, right? I'm really fascinated by the physiological effects that connecting can have on people. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? DUHIGG: Yeah, absolutely. So when we really connect with someone in conversation, when we are sort of on what you might refer to as the same wavelength, what's interesting is it's reflected in our bodies and our brains. So right now, we're having a conversation even though we're separated by hundreds of miles. And yet if we could measure this, what we would see is that your eye pupils and my eye pupils are starting to dilate at the same rate. Our breath patterns are starting to match each other. Our heart rates are starting to match each other. And even more importantly, if we could see inside our brains, what we would see is that my brainwaves are starting to look like your brainwaves and vice versa. Within psychology and neurology, this is known as neural entrainment, and it's at the core of how we communicate with each other. And what it tells us is that communication is connection. When you and I are really communicating with each other, our bodies and our brains become connected in a way that allows us to understand and hear each other much more clearly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: So, Takeaway 1, communication is connection. We tend to think that the goal of a conversation is to make a point or say your opinion. But Charles says that's not a good way to judge the success of an interaction. Instead, in order to really connect, aim to have what he calls a learning conversation. DUHIGG: A conversation is successful if I understand you and you understand me. And what's really nice about that is that if you go in with this attitude of wanting to have a learning conversation, where my goal is simply to learn how you see the world and to share with you how I see the world so you can learn my perspectives, then it takes away all this pressure. I don't have to convince you to vote for my guy. I don't have to convince you to support my issue. I don't have to convince you to support my team. Instead, what I want to do is I want to understand how you see the world. And there's tactics that help us do that. One of my favorite ways of doing this, particularly if you're having a conversation amid conflict is something known as looping for understanding. And what it is - it has three steps. You should ask someone a question, and some questions are more powerful than others. You should listen to what they say. And then step No. 2, you should repeat back in your own words what they just told you. And then step No. 3, and this is the one we usually forget, is you should ask them if you got it right. The reason this is so powerful is because particularly when we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak. But if it's a learning conversation, a conversation where I really want to understand you, if I start proving to you that I'm listening, proving that I want to understand, and then asking you to make sure that I'm getting this right, that I genuinely do understand, both of us are going to trust each other more, even if we completely disagree with each other. TAGLE: So, let me make sure that I have that right. That was looping for understanding, where we're actively showing people that we're listening to them by, you know, paying attention, by asking follow-up questions and making sure that we have that information correct. Is that correct? DUHIGG: That's exactly - so, yes... TAGLE: How'd we do? DUHIGG: So ask a question. You did a good job. You did a good job. Ask a question and then repeat back what you heard them say in your own words, as you just did, and then ask if you got it right. So you are a super communicator. You do this really well. TAGLE: We're doing OK. Thanks so much, Charles. We're hanging in there. We're hanging in there. That's wonderful. DUHIGG: (Laughter). TAGLE: Let's move on to the matching principle, which I know is a big part of super communicating. Matching isn't as simple as mimicking someone's body language, right? DUHIGG: Yeah, absolutely. So one of the best examples is how I came to this book, because I felt like I was having some communication problems in my life. And one in particular, a pattern that I found was happening again and again is, I would come home after a tough day at work and I would start complaining to my wife and I would say, you know, my boss is a jerk and my coworkers don't appreciate me. And she very reasonably would say, oh, you know, why don't you take your boss out for lunch and get to know each other a little bit better? She would try and solve my problem. And instead of listening to her, what I would do is I would get even more upset. I would say, you know, no, I want you to be outraged on my behalf. I want you to be - to support me. And she would get upset because I was acting irrational. She was giving me good advice. And so when I went to researchers and I asked them about this, what they said is like, well, here's the problem. People tend to think of a discussion as being about one thing. It's about my day, or it's about Jimmy's grades or where to go on vacation. But actually every discussion is made up of multiple different kinds of conversations. And in particular, those conversations tend to fall into one of three buckets. There's practical conversations, where we're solving problems or we're making plans. There's emotional discussions where I might share how I'm feeling, and I don't want you to solve my problem. I want you to listen and empathize. And then there's social conversations where we're talking about how we see each other in the context of society. And other people see us. And they said, look, when you were coming home, you were having an emotional conversation. You wanted to talk about how you feel. And your wife responded with a practical conversation. And both of those conversations are totally valid. But because you were having different conversations at the same moment, you couldn't really hear each other. And so the answer is, what you mentioned, the matching principle - that once we figure out what kind of conversation is occurring, that if I match you or I invite you to match me, that's where we really are able to hear each other. TAGLE: Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone. Is it a practical, emotional, social? Once you understand their goals, it'll be easier to really connect. Here's how to decipher one from the other. You say in the book that we all send clues as we speak to other people about what conversation we want to have, right? DUHIGG: Yeah. TAGLE: Can you give us some tools to be better conversation sleuths? You know... DUHIGG: Yes. TAGLE: ...What should we look out for in ourselves and in other people to determine where a conversation is headed? DUHIGG: There's one tactic in particular that's really helpful in figuring out what kind of a conversation is happening. What does this other person want and need, and what do I want out of this discussion? There's certain kinds of questions that are special. These are known as deep questions. To figure out what everyone wants from a conversation, you should ask deep questions. And a deep question is something that asks about people's values or beliefs or experiences. And that can sound kind of scary, right? That sounds pretty intimate, but it's actually pretty... TAGLE: Yeah. DUHIGG: ...Easy to do. If you meet someone who's new, and you ask them, what do you do for a living? And they say, I'm a lawyer, you can ask, oh, you know, what made you decide to become a lawyer? Like, did you always want to be a lawyer? Do you love your job? Those three questions - they're asking that person to talk about their values and their beliefs, the experiences that led them to law school, whether they enjoy going to work each day, what they enjoy about it. They're easy questions to ask. But when we respond to them, we describe so much about ourselves. And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from. The difference between someone who says, oh, I decided to become a lawyer because, you know, I grew up a little bit poor, and I always wanted to have a steady job. I wanted to be able to provide for my family. That person is in a practical frame of mind. They're having a practical conversation. But someone else who says, I decided to become a lawyer because I saw my dad get arrested, and I wanted to fight for the underdog. That person is in a more emotional or maybe even social state of mind. We should have a different kind of conversation with them. It's easy to ask deep questions, easier than we think it is. But more importantly, we learn what this other person is seeking out of this conversation, and we get to share with them what we want as well. TAGLE: It sounds like what you're talking about is the idea of emotional reciprocity, right? DUHIGG: Yes, absolutely. So if someone says, you know - if someone shares something with us that's a little bit vulnerable, we should acknowledge that we've heard that. If they say - if we ask, how was this weekend? And they say, oh, it was a little bit of a tough weekend. And we ask, why? What happened? You know, what was going on? And they say, well, I had to go to a funeral. At that moment, what we should do is rather than skip... TAGLE: Avoid it at all costs, right? DUHIGG: ...Yeah, is lean in a little bit and say, oh, I'm so sorry. Like, tell me about the person. What did they mean to you? And then we can share about ourselves and we can say, you know, my father - and this is actually true - my father passed away six years ago. And one of the things that's been really fascinating to me is how much my relationship with him has continued after his death. Now we're, you know, 45 seconds, a minute into a conversation and we're talking about something real, something where we can get to know each other and understand each other a little bit better. And that emotional reciprocity is at the core of how we learn to trust and like each other. (SOUINDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway three - ask deep questions. That means going beyond your go-to small talk, but you don't have to do that on the fly. Charles recommends preparing for conversations. DUHIGG: There was a study that was done at Harvard Business School, where they asked students before they had a conversation with a stranger. They asked all the students to write down three topics that they thought they could discuss. This took like 10 seconds, right? People would write down, like, you know, this weekend's game and what TV shows I watch, just little dumb throwaway things. And then they went and they had conversations with strangers, and everyone would put the card away. Many of them would put it in their back pocket. And the topics they had jotted down often never came up. But the fact that they were there almost overwhelmingly made all of the participants feel less anxious about those discussions. And as a result, those discussions went much, much better. Oftentimes when we're thinking about talking to someone, when we're thinking about a conversation, particularly a hard conversation - right? - a serious one, we can get really anxious about it because we don't know how it's going to go. And if we just sit down and we just think a little bit, you know, I'm calling up my friend Greg, and I really want to find out, like, if he has any plans for this summer, and I hope that it's just an easy, light conversation. That takes four seconds for me to decide before I start dialing. But studies show it'll make the conversation go better. Because I'm prepared. I'm prepared for what arises. But I also know what I want, and I'm prepared to listen to what he wants. TAGLE: Such a simple thing - you know, if you're nervous, just having a couple topics in your back pocket can make it easier, can make you feel more at ease. DUHIGG: It makes all the difference in the world. I've been thinking about this a lot with conversations with my kids. So I have a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old. They come home from school and, like, I go into auto mode sometimes where I'm like, hey, how was school today? It was fine. Do you have any homework? Yes. I - without even thinking about it, I start asking all these un-deep questions. And so now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to - before my kids get home, I try and think up, like, what's the question that I can ask my son that he actually wants to answer? And sometimes that question is things like, you know, who do you think is the best basketball player of all time? Which is apropos of nothing, but he loves to answer. TAGLE: (Laughter). DUHIGG: And sometimes it's like, hey, you know, I - you mentioned that you went skateboarding with your friends after school. And I'm just wondering, like, Jasper - he seems like a really good friend of yours. Like, what is it about Jasper you like so much? Like, what do you admire about Jasper? When I think and try and come up with these slightly deeper questions, it's as if I've unlocked something in my kids, and suddenly they start telling me about why they like some of their friends and drama with other friends. And then we have real conversations, and then I can tell them about when I was a kid, which they're hopefully fascinated by and sometimes bored by. But it just takes, like, 10 seconds to come up with the real question as opposed to the, the rote question, which is how is school? Do you have homework? So I try and do that more. TAGLE: Just to take a little bit of time - I love that. What about for people who don't - for which that creative question isn't readily available? You know, like, for a stranger, for someone you don't totally know - I mean, you can do a little bit of your research, but if you're not quite sure what's going to open them up, what... DUHIGG: Yeah. TAGLE: ...Any advice there? DUHIGG: So there's a guy named Nicholas Epley, who's a professor at the University of Chicago who's studied this exact question his whole career. And what he's found is that almost any question that asks why helps people open up. So as I mentioned, you know, what do you do for a living? I'm a lawyer. Oh, yeah? Why did you decide to become a lawyer? You know, what did you have for lunch today? I had grilled cheese. Oh, yeah? Why did you decide to have grilled cheese? When we ask why, what we're doing is we're inviting the other person to explain who they are. And it can - when I'm describing it this way, it can seem like, oh, maybe that's harder than it is. Maybe that's more awkward than it is. But what Nick has found is that within three questions - between strangers, between close friends, between people who have nothing in common - within three questions, you can get to something real if you ask why. And it's always easy to ask why. People love to be asked why. Because they love to talk about how they see the world. TAGLE: Charles, could we practice? DUHIGG: Of course. TAGLE: Within three questions. OK. DUHIGG: OK. TAGLE: Charles, what did you do this weekend? DUHIGG: You know, I was in Los Angeles, and I flew back on Saturday. TAGLE: Why were you in LA? DUHIGG: Oh, so I was out there - I was actually promoting my book. I was going on podcasts, and I was talking to folks. And, kind of - it was kind of amazing because I used to live in LA and a chance to go out there and be back there - it's changed so much, but it sort of felt like home in a strange way. TAGLE: Oh, lovely. What do you love about LA? DUHIGG: Ah, you know, the thing I love about LA is it's like 20 different cities in one, right? There's - and so many parts of the cities are so different from each other. There's Koreatown, and there's Chinatown, and there's downtown. There's all these different parts of LA, and as you move through them, you get to experience those cultures in a way that even in a place like New York, it's hard to do. It's just - it's a really dynamic city. And you pick up so much energy just from being on the streets and talking to people. TAGLE: Totally agree. Totally agree. I'm actually - I'm from LA, and I've been... DUHIGG: Oh, are you? TAGLE: Yeah, I am. I'm from LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, and then I went to UCLA and hung out in Westwood for a little while. And every place I've lived in LA has felt like a substantially different place than the LA that I was at previously. DUHIGG: And it's fun, right? It's like you get to go around the world by driving, you know, three miles. It's amazing. TAGLE: Absolutely. I mean, when the three miles takes 45 minutes, I feel a little bit less enthused at times... DUHIGG: Right. That's true. That's true. TAGLE: ...But you're right. DUHIGG: ...That's true. Well, and what I love about what you just did is that you looped me. You - rather than me - waiting for me to ask you, where did you grow up? You built on what I was saying, to say, oh, I actually know LA. I grew up in LA. I can share with you things about LA. We can share this together. And that means, A, I know that you were listening to me, but, B, it means that in addition to sharing who I am, I get to learn something about you, which is that you also like that energy and you love - you like being in Los Angeles, but that, much like me and probably most people, the traffic is not ideal - right (laughter)? - that you probably value your time more than more than just being in a place that's exciting. And so only took us three questions, but I feel like we know each other. TAGLE: I agree. I feel like we did OK, Charles. Thank you. I was nervous about that. DUHIGG: (Laughter). TAGLE: Thank you. Thank you for the positive feedback. See how easy that was? Just listening and responding as yourself can help you really connect. So takeaway four - be authentic. DUHIGG: One of the things that we know about supercommunicators is that they have a couple characteristics - people who are consistently supercommunicators. They tend to ask 10 to 20 times as many questions as everyone else. But the questions are kind of throwaway questions. A lot of them are, like, you know, what do you think about that, or what happened next? So that we don't even hardly register them as questions. They tend to laugh more because they want to show us that they want to connect. But most importantly, they are authentic. So if you say something that indicates that you're struggling with something, they authentically listen to you and they might share something about themselves, or they might ask you a question about that. But they don't try and force something that's false. They don't try and imply that that they're curious, but the reason that they're asking what happened is because they really want to talk about what happened to them. And so the more that we can be authentic with each other, the more that we can listen to what we're feeling and thinking, the more paradoxically we get better listening and in speaking in ways that other people want to listen to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, supercommunicators, let's recap. Takeaway one - communication is about connection, and a learning conversation is a great way to get on the same wavelength with someone. Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone - practical, emotional, social - then match accordingly. Takeaway three - ask lots of questions. Remember, supercommunicators tend to ask 10 to 20 more questions than everyone else, and deep questions will build connection quickly. If nothing comes to mind right away, start with why. Takeaway four - be authentic. You don't have to be an extrovert or comedian to really connect with people. Just lead with your curiosity and don't be scared to be vulnerable. Remember, being a supercommunicator isn't just for the elite few. DUHIGG: Any of us can become a supercommunicator. The reason I wrote the book is because it's just a set of skills that anyone can learn, and when we learn them and when we use them, we begin connecting with other people in this profound way that makes our life so much more meaningful and ultimately makes us healthier and happier and more successful.

The release timed with House votes The latest Epstein files revelation comes as the House returns to session for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history.  House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began in October.  But House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay the vote by keeping the chamber out for seven weeks, and most recently by refusing to swear in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Grijalva is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday afternoon. Critics on both sides of the aisle viewed Johnson's refusal as a means of avoiding the vote to direct the Department of Justice to release the Epstein documents. On the campaign trail, Grijalva, who won a special election Sept. 23, promised to sign onto the bipartisan petition spearheaded by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to force a House vote on the Epstein matter. Grijalva's signature marked the 218th one needed to force a vote on the matter. The Epstein files continue to be a political thorn in the president's side, after Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released several emails from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that refer to President Trump. They raise new questions about the extent of their relationship. NPR's Stephen Fowler has taken a look at those emails, and he's here to explain the context. So, Stephen, what do these documents claim to show? STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Well, these new Epstein emails appear to reveal more connections to the disgraced financier. It's part of a 23,000-document release turned over from Epstein's estate to the House Oversight Committee. There's a 2015 email thread between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, where the pair discuss a potential question from an upcoming CNN interview with Trump about Trump and Epstein's personal ties. A section from Wolff reads in part, quote, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,\" end quote. There's another email, A, that Epstein sent in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell - his associate who was also convicted on trafficking charges - that called Trump the dog that hasn't barked and says Trump spent, quote, \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex-trafficking victims. There's a 2019 email between Epstein and Wolff that saw the disgraced financier write that, quote, \"of course\" Trump \"knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.\" The email does not elaborate further, and it's important to note here that NPR has not independently confirmed the veracity of the correspondence. MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, the House is set to return to action after seven weeks of recess. How does this document dump fit into that? FOWLER: These latest Epstein files come as the House returns for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began, but House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay that vote by keeping the chamber out and most recently by refusing to swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Now, Grijalva will be sworn in this afternoon, and there will be enough votes to move forward with this bipartisan Epstein files petition. Ranking member Robert Garcia said in a statement that, quote, \"the more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" and added that the latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president. MARTÍNEZ: So speaking to that relationship, walk us through the timeline of the previous revelations about the Epstein files and the president's political issues with that topic. FOWLER: Well, in September, House Democrats released more than 200 pages of a birthday book for Epstein, created more than two decades ago, that included a lewd drawing and letter that appears to be signed by Trump. The president has consistently denied any meaningful connection to Epstein, the veracity of the birthday book, and has paid little heed to his own supporters, who have called for a full release of the files kept on Epstein and his alleged crimes, both before and after he died by suicide in 2019 in federal custody. In July, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein fell out because Epstein hired away young female employees who worked at the spa at Mar-a-Lago. And as another reminder, A, Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth. And people across the ideological spectrum feel like that is now a promise that Trump has broken. MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Stephen, thanks.

The action follows a fatal crash in Florida in August 2025 involving an unauthorized driver and earlier fatal crashes in Texas and Alabama. While California claims the revocation is based on state law requiring licenses to expire no later than the end of a person’s legal status, the state's governor Gavin Newsom maintains all drivers had valid federal work authorizations.

Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 4:38 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday. The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns. \"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\" Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV. Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement. \"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns. Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply. The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days. Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after. Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604788","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"SNAP Funding Pause to Soon End, but Anxiety and Anger May Linger","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The end of a two-week government shutdown in November 2025 marks the anticipated return of SNAP benefits for 42 million Americans, but the suspension of funding during the shutdown has sparked widespread anxiety, financial hardship, and public distrust.

    SNAP funding pause to soon end, but anxiety and anger may linger \n         By Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The end of the nation's  longest government shutdown  means food assistance for 42 million Americans should soon be restored after a nearly two week halt. But suspending funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, may have long-lasting impacts, say some experts and those who depend on the program to feed their families.     \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Jacqueline Giammona, a single working mom of two boys, relies on SNAP for most of her groceries. By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.   The Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court. \"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\" Giammona   can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences. \"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said. SNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need. Funded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University. \"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said.   \"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden expanded it by \" Billions and Billions of dollars \" and that benefits were given randomly \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\" In late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments. Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\" \"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said. The administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would   cover roughly half  of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.   The deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic. \"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\" Ideally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown. \"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026. \" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some advocates also worry the SNAP disruption will dissuade people who face hunger from getting help.   \"By making SNAP payments uncertain the shutdown will likely further decrease the number of eligible people who will apply,\" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit Hunger Free America. The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment about concerns over mistrust in the program   and plans to address that. The weeks of hardship, anxiety and chaos caused by the funding pause have, however, shined a light on the importance of the program, many noted. SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from  both major parties .   \"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen. Brittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them. Jansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her partner racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends part-time, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care for their two toddlers. Her own mother didn't fully grasp the struggle. \"When I first told her that we were getting benefits she was confused,\" Jansen said, \"because she was like, 'Well, you both have jobs!'\" Since the shutdown and SNAP funding pause, Jansen has been more open about the fact that her family needs help. \"And I think people are just kind of surprised,\" she said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608105","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:04:00-05:00","title":"Thrilled to be open: Smithsonian and other museums welcome visitors back","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, major cultural institutions including the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, and Ford's Theatre are announcing their reopening plans.

president says 'shocking' settler violence against Palestinians must end \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 4:53 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JERUSALEM — Israel's president and high-ranking military officials on Wednesday condemned attacks a day earlier by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, calling for an end to a growing wave of settler violence in the occupied territory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President Isaac Herzog described the attacks as \"shocking and serious,\" adding a rare and powerful voice to what has been muted criticism by top Israeli officials of the settler violence. Herzog's position, while largely ceremonial, is meant to serve as a moral compass and unifying force for the country. Herzog said the violence committed by a \"handful\" of perpetrators \"crosses a red line,\" adding in a social media post that \"all state authorities must act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       His remarks, and those of two high-ranking military officials, came after dozens of masked Israeli settlers attacked the Palestinian villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf in the West Bank on Tuesday, setting fire to vehicles and other property before clashing with Israeli soldiers. In other developments Wednesday: \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       — Israel reopened a crossing into the northern Gaza Strip that had been closed for two months. The move was welcomed by officials at the United Nations, who say Israel has been too slow in surging humanitarian aid to the territory since a ceasefire began last month. Aid has been delivered into Gaza since Oct. 10 through two crossings in southern and central Gaza. — The Israeli military said it killed four armed militants who posed an \"immediate threat\" in areas of southern Gaza under its control. In Khan Younis, one person was killed while approaching Israeli troops across the so-called yellow line. In Rafah, three people were killed while troops in the area were working to destroy underground tunnels. Military leaders react to settler violence in the West Bank The Israeli army's chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, echoed Herzog's condemnations of the West Bank violence, saying the military \"will not tolerate the phenomena of a minority of criminals who tarnish a law-abiding public.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said the army is committed to stopping violent acts committed by settlers, which he described as contrary to Israeli values and that \"divert the attention of our forces from fulfilling their mission.\" The chief of the military's Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, said responding to an \"anarchist fringe\" requires the use of significant resources that could otherwise be focused on bolstering security and conducting counterterrorism operations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The army said the settlers who attacked the villages fled to a nearby industrial zone and attacked soldiers responding to the violence, damaging a military vehicle. Police said four Israelis were arrested, while the military said four Palestinians were wounded. On Wednesday, police said three of the suspects were released and that one, a minor arrested on suspicion of arson and assault, will remain in custody for six more days, as ordered by a judge. Police said the actions of the three who were released are still under investigation \"with the goal of bringing offenders to justice, regardless of their background.\" Settler violence has surged Tuesday's violence in the West Bank was the latest in a series of attacks by young settlers that have surged since the war in Gaza erupted two years ago. The attacks have intensified in recent weeks as Palestinians harvest their olive trees in an annual ritual. The U.N. humanitarian office last week reported more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in October than in any other month since it began keeping track in 2006. There were over 260 attacks, the office said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Palestinians and human rights workers accuse the Israeli army and police of failing to halt attacks by settlers. Israel's government is dominated by far-right proponents of the settler movement including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who formulates settlement policy, and Cabinet minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the nation's police force. Muayyad Shaaban, who heads an office in the Palestinian Authority that is tracking the violence, said the settlers set fire to four dairy trucks, farmland, tin shacks and tents belonging to a Bedouin community. He said the attacks were part of a campaign to drive Palestinians from their land and accused Israel of giving the settlers protection and immunity. He called for sanctions against groups that \"sponsor and support the colonial settlement terrorism project.\" Palestinians react angrily In Beit Lid, residents said they don't want their lives ruled by fear of settler violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Mahmoud Edeis said the violence is undermining his family's right to live in safety. \"To feel that my children are safe, that when I go to sleep I can say, 'Okay, there's nothing (to worry about),'\" he said. \"But at any moment something could happen … This can't go on. It can't be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger.\" Amjad Amer Al-Juneidi, who works at a dairy factory that was attacked Tuesday, said the \"fully organized\" attack saw one person carrying gasoline-filled cans, another prying open the factory door with a crowbar and a third individual igniting the fuel. \"Their entry into the company wasn't random. It was organized, and they had a fully organized tactic for how to carry out the burning,\" Al-Juneidi said. UN officials say more aid is needed in Gaza \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While U.N. officials welcomed the Israeli decision to reopen the Zikim crossing into northern Gaza, they also reiterated criticism of Israel for not doing more. Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesperson, said Wednesday that humanitarian groups in Gaza are being hampered in their ability to distribute food once it arrives in the territory and having to \"stretch out the available stocks.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The demand for baby formula, for example, far exceeds the current supply, UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Pires said there are also concerns about whether there will be enough syringes to carry out a vaccination campaign that began this month and will continue into January. He said there could be supply problems starting next month if Israel doesn't allow greater shipments into Gaza. The Israeli agency in charge of humanitarian aid in Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement on Tuesday that \"Israel is fully committed to its obligation to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid trucks in accordance with the (ceasefire) agreement.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5606359","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:02:00-12:02","title":"Ken Burns' 'American Revolution' will make you think differently about U.S. history","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ken Burns' new six-part documentary, 'The American Revolution,' offers a deeply human and visually innovative reexamination of the founding era of the United States.

Bianculli \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 12:02 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Fresh Air \n        \n      \n\n         Documentary producer and director  Ken Burns  came to prominence 35 years ago with  The Civil War,  a massively popular multi-part nonfiction series on PBS.   His latest effort is a six-part series called  The American Revolution. By focusing on the Revolutionary War ,  Burns is revisiting some very familiar territory. His long and impressive filmography includes a history of Congress, and biographies of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. He's done deep dives into American military conflicts, including  World War II  and the  Vietnam War . Throughout his career, Burns has developed and perfected the tricks of his particular trade: the evocative use of music and quotations from speeches and correspondence; the use of actors to read the words of historical participants; the zooming in and out to reveal key details in period photos; and the painstaking attention to sound effects, from birds to bullets, to help bring those images to life. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       All of that knowledge, and all of those gimmicks, are utilized in  The American Revolution , an exceptional work about the founding of our country. It's written by Geoffrey C. Ward, who wrote  The Civil War  and many other Burns documentaries, including the ones on Congress and Thomas Jefferson. And it's co-directed by Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, both of whom have worked with Burns for years. But  The American Revolution  presents a challenge that even  The Civil War  did not. No photographs, period. To compensate, Burns and company use war re-enactors and place them in the actual historical locations.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On many — let's say most — documentaries using a similar technique, the effect can be cheesy. But in  The American Revolution,  the directors avoid showing the faces of the actors re-enacting battle movements. Instead, parts of their bodies are shown in intense close-up: a bandaged hand here, a muddy boot there. Elsewhere, in an approach that borders on pure art, the directors use drones to capture the action from high, high above. It's unusual — and beautiful. Battles are the surprisingly dominant ingredient of this series.  The American Revolution  goes into more detail about individual battles than I ever learned in my own American history classes — but new and vintage maps, animated to show troop positions and movements, make it all very clear, and very vibrant. The actors quoting from the historical participants, and the historians interviewed to comment on the action, do the rest. Peter Coyote, the actor who has narrated many Burns documentaries, does so again here. He's got a great voice for it, and leans into all the difficult place names, and people's names, with confident authority.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In their various war documentaries, Burns and his team always have focused as much on the ground troops as on the generals — often much more so, telling their story from the bottom up, rather than the top down.  The American Revolution  does both: We hear important observations from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, but also from Native Americans, revolutionary women, enslaved people and others not always given voice in such narratives.  In addition, the program's historians make us think differently about the history we're witnessing. In the colonies, those who were faithful to the crown were called Loyalists, and those against them called themselves Patriots. This series humanizes both sides, and also explains why some Native tribes, including the Shawnees, sided with the British in hopes of protecting their own lands.  The sheer number of the battles, and the details about them, attest to how hard our ancestors fought for the notion of a Federalist society. At the end,  The American Revolution  reminds us that the quest to maintain that society, and to strive to achieve a more perfect union, is far from over.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97607","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"21:46:00-05:00","title":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history comes to a close","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days and beginning in October 2025, ended on November 12, 2025, after President Trump signed a bipartisan funding bill passed by the House.

The bill passed Wednesday night   despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats   joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York. Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209. President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.  \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\" In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a  court battle  because of the shutdown. The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs. But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown —  extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year  — is not addressed in the bill. Instead, as part of the  deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators , Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies. That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure. Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. A lot of pain, not a lot of gain Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception. The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown  in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government. With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table. But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government. In the meantime,  42 million Americans who participate with SNAP  didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's  order to scale back flights . Millions of federal workers went without pay. The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient. Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care. \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\" Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he  took a step back  during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who  repeatedly   asked   where   Trump  \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions. What happens now?  Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year. Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage. If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year. Some Republicans have shown  interest  in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps. And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535565","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:00","title":"Why home insurance is unaffordable, even in places without wildfires or hurricanes","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how home insurance in the central U.S., particularly in states like Nebraska, has become unaffordable due to increasing hailstorm damage linked to climate change. A severe hailstorm in Cozad, Nebraska, on June 29, 2024, caused widespread damage to homes, vehicles, and public infrastructure, with an estimated $100 million in local damage and contributing to $160 billion in nationwide insured losses from hail in 2024. Despite being a non-coastal region without hurricanes or wildfires, the central U.S. now faces some of the highest home insurance costs in the country. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance reached nearly $6,400 — over $4,000 above the national average — due to rising premiums driven by climate-related weather events.

5:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The storm blew into Cozad, Neb., in the wee hours of Saturday, June 29, 2024. The wind felt like a hurricane. The hail was the size of softballs. \"I was in the window, I was crying,\" remembers Soledad Avalos, who has lived with her husband in their home in Cozad for 35 years. \"Seeing all the damage [to] the cars and the house.\" When the sun came up, the extent of the damage became clear. Cozad is a small town of about 4,000 people, surrounded by corn fields. Crops were flattened. Virtually every vehicle parked outside that night had a broken windshield. Nearly every roof in town was leaking, or worse. Siding was missing, paint had been stripped away. The storm came from the northwest, and so nearly every northwest-facing window was cracked. Both the hospital and the school were in disrepair. \"Those softball-sized hail stones just punched a hole through the roof membrane, and water was just pouring through the ceiling like a waterfall, or a shower,\" says Robert Dyer, the CEO of the Cozad Community Health System, which runs Cozad Community Hospital, the only hospital in town. \"Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating.\" The hospital's emergency department had to shut down for several hours, and the building is still being repaired more than a year later. Hailstorms like the one that hit Cozad don't often make national headlines, because they are usually hyper-local events that hit just one town, or one neighborhood in a larger city. Most hailstorms don't cause enough damage to trigger federal disaster declarations, or make it onto official annual lists of major weather disasters. And they are generally less deadly than flash floods, hurricanes and wildfires. But extremely costly hailstorms are getting more likely in the United States, researchers warn. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a pool ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have  more frequent hail  as the planet warms up. That risk is driving up the cost of home insurance in the middle of the country, saddling average Americans with huge bills. Areas with the most hail risk are seeing some of the fastest growing home insurance prices in the U.S.,  according to  two landmark  federal reports  released in the last year. \"In the Midwest, you've seen a surprising increase in losses,\" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest property insurance trade group. \"It's particularly the hail, the wind. A lot of damage to roofs.\" That escalating damage is a reminder that, as climate change drives more extreme weather, geography is no longer a guarantee of protection from skyrocketing insurance rates. Home insurance costs are skyrocketing in the middle of the U.S. The central United States is home to the  worst hail risk  on the planet. \"North America is the hail continent,\" explains Scott St. George, a climate scientist and the head of weather and climate research at WTW, an international risk analysis company. And he says hail is different from other types of severe weather because it does a lot of property damage without causing many fatalities. \"It basically damages anything that's outside. And we've got a lot of stuff in the way,\" according to St. George. \"There are more houses insured, more expensive cars. Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors.\" That has led to enormous bills for property insurance companies. \"You've seen some really big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S.\" says St. George. Last summer's hailstorm in Cozad caused an estimated $100 million in property damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith – an enormous sum for a town of just 4,000 people. And, in 2024, hailstorms caused an  estimated $160 billion  in damage to homes nationwide, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. That figure doesn't even include storms that produced hail less than 2 inches in diameter, which can still cause widespread damage. With losses mounting, insurance companies have raised prices in recent years. Nationwide, the cost of insurance rose about 8% faster than inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a  major report  published by the Treasury Department in January.  The report found that the average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers in the Northern Plains paying about 20% more than the national average, and consumers in the Southern Plains paying more than 45% more. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance this year is nearly $6,400, according to  Bankrate . That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average. In September, the Treasury report was removed from the department's website by the Trump administration. The Treasury Department did not respond to questions from NPR about why it was removed. Hail risk is only one of many reasons that insurance is more expensive. The higher cost of labor, and of construction materials are also driving up insurance prices, says St. George. \"Insurance is very impacted by inflation,\" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. \"So if inflation suddenly spikes, then insurance losses go up.\" And the  cost of building materials  has increased even more than other goods in recent years, he points out. Insurance companies are bringing in profits. Small towns are struggling Rising prices for homeowners appear to be translating into profits for the industry. After losing more than $10 billion in 2023, the industry saw $26 billion in profits in 2024, according to credit agency AM Best. Insurers say that's largely due to the severity of disasters in a given year. \"It can be a dramatic swing because some years you have huge catastrophes,\" says Gordon. When insurers raise prices, they are simply passing along the enormous costs of rebuilding from major disasters, he says. But high prices are hitting many homeowners hard, particularly in places with historically low cost-of-living, like Nebraska. \"Insurance in our state really has skyrocketed the past several years,\" says Josh Tapio, an insurance broker at All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb. A few years ago, an average homeowner would pay about $1,500 per year to insure their $300,000 home, Tapio says. Now, it costs between $3,000 to $4,500, a two or even threefold increase. \"There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill and they see that it's double from what they paid last year,\" Tapio says. His office has never been busier, as people shop around for a policy they can afford. The high cost of insurance can make property ownership untenable. Before the storm, longtime Cozad resident Jennifer McKeone owned two rental houses in town. The hail caused extensive damage to both, and her insurance company refused to keep insuring them. \"I scrambled to find insurance, and the only insurance I could find was going to raise the rent to the point where I didn't think the people who lived in the houses could afford it,\" McKeone says. She ended up selling the homes, because neither she nor her tenants could afford the insurance costs. Seniors are hit particularly hard by rising insurance costs In the year and a half since the storm hit Cozad, most of the broken windows have been replaced, and most of the leaking roofs have been repaired. \"The town is doing well,\" says McKeone, who runs the Cozad Development Corporation, a local group that builds housing in town and works with businesses. But under the surface, McKeone says, many are still trying to finish repairs to their homes. Seniors have been hit particularly hard, she says. Many older residents live on a fixed income from a pension or social security payments, and can't afford drastically higher bills. Baltazar and Soledad Avalos, whose home was severely damaged in the storm, have experienced insurance problems firsthand. The home that they've lived in for 35 years had an insurance policy, but that policy didn't cover the full cost of all the repairs to the roof, windows and siding. Baltazar is still out on a ladder most days, fixing damage at age 72. On top of that, the cost of their insurance has gone up by about 10%, which is significant for a retirement-age couple. Baltazar is retired, Soledad is still working. Insurance is more expensive, and it covers less One of the biggest complaints among Cozad residents is that, even as they shell out more for property insurance, that insurance is covering less. Many people in town now have policies with higher deductibles, meaning that they need to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before the insurance kicks in. And many new policies also don't cover the full cost of replacing a damaged roof, which is often the most expensive repair after a hailstorm. Megan Fales has worked as an insurance agent in Cozad for more than a decade, and handles hundreds of home insurance policies in town. \"A lot of people have just gotten to the point where, like 'Let's just take a higher deductible,'\" she says, because it costs less each month, even though they agree to pay more for repairs if there's a future storm. She says many homeowners in the area hope to save money by doing repairs themselves, instead of relying on insurance to pay. Businesses in town are also paying more money for less coverage. After the storm destroyed the roof of the local hospital, the insurance company refused to renew the policy. The only policies available are more expensive, and also have a much higher deductible for the roof. That means the hospital must pay more each month for insurance, and also must keep more cash on hand in case there's another storm. In an effort to avoid catastrophic damage in future storms, the hospital's governing board chose to upgrade the building. Instead of simply replacing the damaged roof, they are investing in roof materials that can withstand high winds and small hail. That choice saved them money on their monthly insurance premium, Dyer says. But even with those savings, they are paying more money for less coverage, compared to two years ago. \"It's to a point of unsustainability,\" says Dyer. \"If we got hit by another storm right now, it would drain all our cash.\" NPR's Robert Benincasa contributed to this story. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Delegates from around the world, meeting at the annual United Nations climate conference, are talking about home insurance. Insurance is getting very expensive in large part because of extreme weather. In the U.S., insurance is especially high in coastal states with intense hurricanes and wildfires, and there is another hot spot at the very heart of the country. NPR's Rebecca Hersher takes us there. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: It's been nearly 18 months since a hailstorm damaged the only hospital in Cozad, Nebraska. Robert Dyer, the CEO of Cozad's Community Health System, walked me through the construction zone, where ceilings are still being repaired. ROBERT DYER: Softball-sized hailstones just punched a hole through the roof membrane. HERSHER: Water came pouring through those holes, he says. DYER: Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating. HERSHER: And it wasn't just the hospital that got hit hard. Robyn Geiser is the housing director for the local Cozad Development Corporation. ROBYN GEISER: It impacted houses, cars, businesses. If it was in the open, it was impacted. HERSHER: She says virtually every car in town had a cracked windshield. GEISER: Houses that - it shredded the vinyl siding. HERSHER: Even now, some houses in town look like they were sprayed with bullets. Double-paned windows have spidery patterns where one pane was shattered by the hailstones. One local insurance agent estimated the storm did $100 million in damage in a town of just 4,000 people, which means there were a lot of insurance claims. Massive insurance payments for hail are getting more common, says Scott St. George, a climate scientist at Willis Towers Watson, an international risk analysis company. SCOTT ST GEORGE: You've seen some big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S. HERSHER: He says the main reason is that there's more and more stuff in hail-prone parts of the country. ST GEORGE: Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors. You know, basically anything that's outside that's in the path of a hailstorm that's insured is very vulnerable to a lot of expensive repairs. HERSHER: In 2024, hailstorms caused an estimated $160 billion in insured damage to homes in the U.S., according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. Insurers have responded by raising the price of insurance in the middle of the country, where damaging hail is most common. More expensive building materials and labor have also driven up prices nationwide. The upshot is that the Great Plains now have some of the most expensive home insurance in the country, according to two recent federal reports, which means average homeowners there are struggling with huge bills. JOSH TAPIO: There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill from their company and they see that it's doubled from what they paid last year. HERSHER: Josh Tapio is an insurance agent in Omaha. TAPIO: It's just becoming unaffordable in our state, is the new reality. HERSHER: Tapio says he doesn't expect insurance prices to go down in the future. Insurance premiums have increased 40% nationwide in the last six years, according to Lending Tree, and the weather is only getting worse. The risk of hail in the central U.S. is increasing as the planet gets even warmer, which means this is just the beginning of the insurance affordability crisis in places like Cozad, Nebraska. The hospital in Cozad is dealing with the new reality head-on. CEO Robert Dyer says they're paying a lot more for insurance these days and getting a lot less coverage, which is frustrating, but also increasingly common for both businesses and homeowners. Dyer is proud of how the hospital is dealing with the financial stress of rising insurance costs and more hail risk. He brings me into the new front lobby of the hospital, where workers are sanding drywall and installing new wiring. DYER: We decided to try to turn lemons into lemonade. HERSHER: There's a brand-new roof above our heads. And that roof has something called hail board in it, a hard layer that can withstand big balls of ice. The hail board means the roof costs more, says Dyer, but he's hoping the investment is worth it. What would happen if... DYER: Another one. HERSHER: ...Another hailstorm like this happened next year? DYER: Well, I would hope, with the mitigation that we put in place, we wouldn't have catastrophic failure on our roof. HERSHER: The repairs would probably drain the hospital's cash, he says. It wouldn't be good, but it wouldn't shut the whole place down.

Instead of immediately seeking out extra-cushioned footwear or super-specialized shoe inserts, start with some foot exercises, says  Irene Davis , a professor of physical therapy and rehab sciences at the University of South Florida. \"People have these amazing muscles in their feet,\" Davis says. \"They actually have the ability to increase the strength and capacity of their feet, which can help with the pain.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In fact, regularly exercising your feet and ankles has been shown to reduce the risk of injury, prevent and alleviate pain and improve overall foot health, says  Dr. Adam Tenforde , an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.  Foot care experts share six exercises to try at home. Whether you're gearing up for that big soccer game, recuperating from a long day at work or just want the strongest feet possible to avoid trips and falls in the future, give them all a try or start with just one. Consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions, experience pain or have preexisting foot conditions like bunions, plantar fasciitis or achilles tendonitis. Exercise 1: Foot doming This exercise is like doing crunches for your feet. It targets your \"foot core,\" the muscles that work together to stabilize the foot for dynamic movement, Davis says. In the same way core exercises like planks or mountain climbers are important for total body movement, strengthening your foot core provides stability so the larger muscles that move the foot and ankle can do their job and protect against pain and injury, Davis says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       How to do it:  Start in a seated position, Tenforde says. Ground both the heels and the toes while pulling back the ball of the foot to raise your arch. Once raised, squeeze the arch muscles for a few seconds. Hold for two to three seconds for 10 repetitions to start. Once you've got the hang of it, try the same exercise standing, then slowly move up to 20- to 30-second holds for three to five repetitions to build endurance, Tenforde says. Foot doming can be practiced daily. Incorporate it into everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or waiting in line at the grocery store, he says. Exercise 2: Wall stretches This exercise can be effective for pain relief and increasing blood flow to your feet, says podiatrist  Ebonie Vincent . It's especially helpful if you suffer from plantar fasciitis. How to do it:  Stand up facing a wall. Then, wedge the toes of one foot against the wall, with the foot at about a 45-degree angle, keeping the heel on the ground. Place your hands on the wall for support if needed. Slowly begin to bend the knee of that elevated foot and bring your body forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your calf and the bottom of your foot. Vincent suggests holding the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeating three times on each side, up to three times a day. Exercise 3: Toe spreads Did you know you have the ability to spread out your toes as wide as you can spread out your fingers? If that idea seems wild, it's probably because for many people the range of motion in the toes has been limited by a lifetime of toe-constraining footwear, Davis says. The lateral stretching of toe spread exercises can help improve your flexibility and motor control, protect against bunion pain and increase foot stability, Tenforde says. How to do it:  Spread your toes as wide as possible and then bring them back to   a neutral position. To isolate the correct muscles, it's best not to flex or extend your toes as you go, Davis says. If you find that tough, try using toe separators, the kind you might use while getting a pedicure. Simply squeeze your toes against them for a few seconds, then stretch as far outside of them as you can for another few seconds. Try two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions   daily. Don't be discouraged if you have limited mobility at first, says Tenforde. Over time, your muscles should get stronger and you should be able to stretch wider. Exercise 4: Toe Yoga  Don't worry, no miniature yoga mat required here. But like other yoga practices, toe yoga — or toe-ga, as Davis and Tenforde call it — can improve your balance and foot stability by strengthening a number of your toe muscles. Strong toes are important for the \"push-off\" function needed to walk or run, among other things, Davis says. How to do it:  Stand with your feet on the floor and lift up your big toe while keeping your lesser toes on the ground. Then, raise your lesser toes while keeping your big toe on the ground. Do two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions daily, Tenforde says. Exercise 5: Calf raises  Yep, they're not just for rounding out leg day at the gym. Since they mimic the propulsive phase of walking or running, Tenforde says calf raises are great for strengthening the stabilizing muscles and ligaments of the foot and ankle. But take care: while it might look easy, this exercise is often done wrong, he says. How to do it:  To get the most out of a calf raise, slowly rise up onto the front of your foot by activating your arch and lifting your heel as high as is comfortable. Then, use those same muscles of your arch and big toe to slowly lower the heel back down to the ground. It's common to roll to the lesser toes and the outside of the foot on your way down, but that works the wrong muscles and can lead to injury, Tenforde says. Once you've got the right mechanics down, aim for two to three sets of 10-15 reps every other day. Start with double leg calf raises and then move to single leg if you're up for a challenge, Tenforde says. Exercise 6: Hold hands with your feet This one is more of a stretch to warm up or cool down — and will make your feet feel happy, says orthopedic surgeon  Dr. Erica Rowe Urquhart . How to do it:  Sit in a comfortable seated position. Interlace the fingers of one hand with the toes of the opposite foot and gently massage the bottom of your feet with the thumb of your free hand. Then, gently rotate the foot and ankle to help loosen any tension in the foot and lubricate your joints, she says. By spending just a few minutes holding hands with each foot at the beginning and end of each day, you can prepare your feet for all the work they'll be doing — and then thank them for all the weight they carried throughout the day. And we could all stand to show our feet a little more care and gratitude, Urquhart says. This story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

First, let go of a common myth \n         By Julia Furlan \n        \n           Saturday, April 5, 2025 • 4:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When journalist  Conz Preti  brought her three children to visit family in Argentina in 2022, her four-year-old son did something surprising. \"He just started fluently speaking in Spanish with my family, with no hesitation, no mistakes,\" Preti says. In their house, she speaks to her children in Spanish and her husband speaks to them in English. But up until that point, her son   \"never, never talked to me in Spanish. Suddenly, it clicked,\" she says. Raising bilingual kids can feel like a challenge — especially on top of so many other things parents worry about.  But with \"consistency, exposure and practice, practice, practice,\" it's possible to successfully teach your child two or more languages, says  Liliana Diaz , a bilingual speech-language pathologist who is raising her two kids to speak Spanish and English. No expensive language lessons or language immersion school required. \"Children are like sponges absorbing everything they're seeing and hearing,\" says  Farwa Husain , a bilingual speech-language pathologist who is raising her three children to speak Hindi, Urdu and English. Whether you want your kids to learn your heritage language or the French you mastered in college, Diaz and Husain offer expert, parent-approved advice on how to cultivate a multilingual household. Let go of a common misconception  Some parents worry that teaching their child multiple languages will set them back or confuse them. But that's a myth, Husain says. According to a 2013 article in the journal  Learning Landscapes , kids who speak two languages are  not more likely  than kids who speak one language to \"have difficulties with language, to show delays in learning or to be diagnosed with a language disorder.\" The article also notes that \"code-mixing,\" or using two languages in the same sentence, is often  interpreted as confusion . It's actually a \"normal part of bilingual development,\" and even a sign of \"bilingual children's ingenuity,\" according to the researchers. In fact, being bilingual can come with several benefits. Studies have shown it can improve  cognitive function ,  help with multitasking  and boost  academic achievement . Pick a language strategy for your family  There are many effective ways to incorporate multiple languages with your kids at home. Pick an approach that works for your family, Diaz says. Our experts recommend a few techniques from the field of bilingual-speech language pathology. One parent, one language . Each caregiver speaks one language consistently with the child. For example, one parent speaks with the child in Mandarin and the other speaks in Hindi consistently at all times. Time and place . The family decides that, say, on Sundays, at breakfast or when they're at grandma's house, they will speak the minority language. Minority language at home . Everybody will speak the minority language at home, and then as the child goes to school, they're exposed to the majority language.  Mixed languages at home : Caregivers and kids all speak all languages simultaneously at home. It may sound confusing, but it works well in practice, Husain says. \"Children are able to decipher very quickly what each language is.\" Whichever technique you decide on, stick with it, say our experts. \"That's what it takes to learn a language,\" Diaz says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Create an immersive language environment at home There are many small, constructive ways to incorporate multiple languages into your day-to-day life. The exposure can add up, according to our experts. Here are a few ideas: Do the activities you're already doing with your kids in the second language.  \"Whether that's listening to music in the car, watching cartoons on TV, going on playdates or  reading,\" Diaz says. Aim for \"consistency, not perfection.\" Video-call relatives.  \"Being able to FaceTime a grandparent, sibling or cousin and have that back and forth with them in another language is so important,\" Husain says. \"You're building those same skills as if you're doing it in person.\"  Celebrate cultural events.  Providing children with the cultural context around their second language can make language learning more fun. Diaz makes a point to celebrate Día de Los Muertos with her two children so they have a connection to their Mexican heritage. \"Language is culture, which is identity,\" Foster curiosity.  Preti says she and her husband, who is fluent in French, \"always play and experiment with language with the kids. The other day, they wanted to know how to say some words in French, and were starting to pick up the similarities between Spanish and French.\"  Embrace imperfection  There will be times when your child just wants to speak the dominant language or mix their dominant and non-dominant languages together, and that's OK, our experts say. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Don't force it, Diaz says. \"If you want them to speak in a particular language at the moment,\" acknowledge what the child is saying first \"then model and respond in that language.\" If your child is code-mixing, don't try to correct them, Husain says. Instead, use it as an opportunity to engage.  Diaz says she loves when her son tries \"to carry one language over to the other. Sometimes he'll say these mixed English-Spanish words, and I'm like, 'Oh, that's a good one. I never thought of saying it that way.'\"  And have some patience. Preti says sometimes her kids will tell her they don't understand her when she's speaking to them in Spanish. \"I'm like, 'But you understand what I'm saying right now?' And they're like, 'Yeah.' And I'm like, 'Well, this is Spanish.'\"  Eventually, your child will get it, even if they don't realize it.  This episode was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

  Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 11:36 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Once again,  Taylor Swift  tops this week's  Billboard  albums and singles charts. Elsewhere, two holidays collide, as Halloween perennials coexist with the charts' first flurries of the Christmas season. Along the way,  Michael Jackson 's \"Thriller\" shoots up the chart, making this the sixth consecutive decade in which Jackson has scored at least one top 10 hit. That's an all-time chart record. TOP STORY Before the streaming era, holidays rarely had much of an impact on  Billboard 's Hot 100 singles chart. You'd see an occasional novelty hit here and there, but generally speaking, the Hot 100 in December didn't look all that different from the Hot 100 in, say, March. The streaming era has changed that radically — and in ways that extend well beyond Christmas time. Just this year,  Toby Keith 's  35 Biggest Hits  compilation  zoomed back into the top 10  in the aftermath of July 4.  Earth, Wind & Fire 's  Greatest Hits   re-entered the  Billboard  200  albums chart because so many fans like to stream the group's 1978 song \"September\" — with its famous question, \"Do you remember the 21st night of September?\" — on Sept. 21. And Halloween? Well, Halloween has become a musical season unto itself — for at least a few weeks, anyway. Last week's charts reflect the seven days immediately before Halloween — the \"spooky season,\" you might say, but not the holiday itself or the weekend that followed. And several titles did re-enter the charts, led by Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" which resurfaced on the Hot 100 at No. 32. This week's charts cover a seven-day stretch beginning with Halloween, so you get a full reflection of costume-party playlists and titles streamed on front porches for the benefit of trick-or-treaters. And, though it can't compare to the annual pre-Christmas onslaught, a handful of spooky and spookiness-adjacent songs do make their way back onto the Hot 100 this week. The songs themselves are more or less exactly what you'd expect:  Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett  & The Crypt-Kickers' \"Monster Mash\" (No. 21), Ray Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" (No. 22) and Rockwell's \"Somebody's Watching Me\" (No. 24) all reemerge from their respective crypts in lockstep, with The Citizens of Halloween's \"This Is Halloween\" (from  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas ) right behind them. But one Halloween jam outshines them all — and hits some massive milestones in the process. \"Thriller\" was the seventh single from Jackson's 1982 mega-blockbuster of the same name and hit No. 4 during its initial chart run. It became a durable classic — and Halloween staple — thanks to  its iconic video , which premiered in December 1983. \"Thriller\" has re-entered the Hot 100 numerous times since then, most prominently in the aftermath of Jackson's death in 2009. This week, it jumps from No. 32 all the way to No. 10. For Jackson, that triggers a remarkable chart milestone: He's the first artist in history to hit the top 10 in  six different decades . Before, he was tied with … who,  The Beatles ? Nope.  Elvis Presley ? Nuh-uh. The answer is  Andy Williams , who had loads of hits in the '50s, '60s and '70s, then returned to the top 10 in the 2010s and 2020s thanks to the streaming-fueled holiday hit \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.\" In Jackson's case, his six decades have been consecutive — and there's even a seventh with an asterisk, because  The Jackson 5  cracked the top 10 with \"I Want You Back\" in December 1969. Prior to this week's \"Thriller\" renaissance, Jackson's last appearance in the top 10 arrived thanks to his posthumous appearance in  Drake 's 2018 hit \"Don't Matter to Me.\" Don't expect \"Thriller\" to remain in the top 10 now that Halloween is an increasingly distant memory. The spooky season is well and truly over, provided you don't look too closely at the Hot 100 and grimace in terror as you spy the song at No. 31. It's  Mariah Carey , who reenters the chart — earlier than ever — with \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Eeeeeeeeeeeek! TOP ALBUMS For the fifth straight week, Taylor Swift's  The Life of a Showgirl  sits atop the  Billboard  200 albums chart. But Swift's grip on the top spot would at least appear to be slipping, with several high-profile albums on the immediate horizon. Though she's yet to hit the  Billboard  200's top 10 in her career,  Rosalía 's  LUX  is due to hit next week's charts, and has gotten tremendous reviews. (Seriously, it's so great.)  Summer Walker 's  Finally Over It  drops this Friday and will enter the  Billboard  200 the following week.  Michael Bublé 's  Christmas  has —  [emits deep, tortured sigh, followed by a three-minute stare, unblinking, into the middle distance]  — already reentered the chart at No. 65. The Life of a Showgirl  easily survived this week's top new threat, as  Florence + The Machine  debuted at No. 4 with a Halloween-friendly new album called  Everybody Scream . And a huge chart leap for  Tyler, The Creator 's  CHROMAKOPIA  — boosted by the release of deluxe editions surrounding the anniversary of its release — only sent it from No. 117 to No. 5. Still, for  The Life of a Showgirl  — and for those of us who toil aggressively to avoid exposure to Bublé's music — winter is coming. Case in point: There are now  four  Christmas albums on the  Billboard  200. Bublé leads the way, followed by the  Vince Guaraldi Trio 's  A Charlie Brown Christmas  (No. 85), Carey's  Merry Christmas  (No. 113) and  Bing Crosby 's  Ultimate Christmas  (No. 160). Whole lotta holiday-music enthusiasts are out there opening their gifts early this year. TOP SONGS Taylor Swift is a master of extending her chart runs, thanks to a deep bag of tricks that includes remixes, staggered releases on vinyl and CD, acoustic versions and more. The woman possesses a great many talents, but she's an all-timer when it comes to leveraging her fans' enthusiasm. On the albums chart, it's a challenge to extend  The Life of a Showgirl 's run at No. 1, in part because she's already exhausted so many of those opportunities in the album's first week of release. The price of that record-setting sales week is that it gets harder and harder to go back to the well and sell fans more copies of the same album. But when it comes to \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" which tops the Hot 100 for a fifth straight week, she's still got some bullets in the chamber as she labors to remain ahead of two colossal hits. And she needs them, because the song isn't No. 1 in streaming  or  radio airplay this week. The top song on streaming is HUNTR/X's \"Golden,\" from the  KPop Demon Hunters  soundtrack. When it comes to commercial radio airplay, the top song is  Alex Warren 's \"Ordinary,\" which is likely evident to anyone who's tried to listen to a commercial pop station since, say, June. But the former lags a bit in airplay, the latter lags a bit in streaming and \"The Fate of Ophelia\" leads the field in sales — an area where Swift's bag of tricks comes in especially handy. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" gets a boost this week from two alternate versions: an \"Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version\" that's padding her streaming and sales numbers, and a brand-new remix by the duo Loud Luxury that dropped on Nov. 6. Those moves were enough to keep the song atop the Hot 100 for another week, but as the holidays loom, all three songs face a force as predictable as the tides. Today, they're jockeying for the top of the charts; tomorrow, they'll all be eating  Paul Anka 's dust. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97432","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:15:00-05:00","title":"The Ripple Effect of Kindness: How Small Acts Change Lives","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the profound impact of acts of kindness on individuals and society, using personal stories and scientific research to demonstrate that kindness is not just emotional but measurable and transformative.

We wanted to share that kind thought with you because today, November 13, is \"World Kindness Day\" — created back in 1998 by a consortium of kindhearted charities. If you're going to celebrate, say organizers, you should do at least one intentional act of kindness. (I don't think it counts if you're kind to yourself, although honestly, it can't hurt!) For us at Goats and Soda, in addition to sharing a kind thought with our devoted readers, we thought, this is a good opportunity to learn more about kindness — and to find out how acts of kindness can change lives. That's especially critical in a world where cruelty, war and bad news seem omnipresent. Some hardhearted souls may even question whether small acts of kindness really matter. Spoiler alert: They do! So … kindly stick with us as we explore … kindness. Let's start with a simple yet profound story about a snack. Back in 2004,  Maymunah Yusuf Kadiri , a neuro-psychiatrist and mental health advocate in Nigeria, was a young doctor working in the emergency room at the Lagos State University Teaching hospital. One night sticks in her mind. It was chaos. There were accident victims everywhere. She recalls the blood, the cries and her own exhaustion. \"I hadn't eaten for over 12 hours, and my hands were shaking,\" says Kadiri, who was 28 at the time. \"Then an elderly cleaner, one of those invisible heroes in hospitals, walked up to me with a small nylon bag.\" Inside was a biscuit and a sachet of water. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"you need small strength to save people.\" \"It sounds simple, but I'll never forget it. That biscuit tasted like hope. Her kindness reminded me that healing isn't only about medicine, it's about humanity,\" says Kadiri. \"As a psychiatrist, I've seen it over and over: People don't just heal in hospitals, they heal in human connections.\" And while one isolated act of kindness may seem random, it can lead to much more. Huguette Diakabana  remembers when she had to drop out of school at age 10 — until a mysterious donor came to her rescue. Her family was planning to emigrate to the U.S. from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and couldn't afford school fees. They figured she'd make up the year later. She had a different idea: \"I put on my previous year's uniform and sat outside under the street window of my would-be classroom.\" One day, the director invited her inside. Diakabana realized someone must have paid her school fees, but who?  Returning to the school years later, Diakabana discovered it was a school guard. She wanted to repay him. \"He told me to help others when I could, so I launched a scholarship program,\" says Diakabana, who now lives in Switzerland and is co-founder of The Luminous Agency, which focuses on digital literacy. Dr. Junaid Nabi, a physician-scientist who conducts research in health care technology at the RAND School in Washington, D.C. and is a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute, says he's come to realize that kindness isn't actually a trickle in the ocean. An act of kindness is more like dropping a stone that creates expanding ripples,   he says .  \"There are  studies  that illustrate how kindness spreads through social networks in measurable ways. When we are kind to someone, they don't just feel better — they become 25% more likely to help others.\" One such investigation described how kindness can be contagious. It was sparked by reports of an outbreak of kindness on a cold December morning in 2012. A stranger picked up the tab for the coffee order of the next customer in the drive-through line at a Tim Hortons coffeehouse in Winnipeg, Canada. And that customer picked up the tab of the person behind him. In the end, 226 customers passed on this act of kindness. The study authors, citing other examples of \"pay it forward\" kindness at fast food restaurants and their own experiments encouraging subjects to help others, write: \"Why, in the absence of external sanctions and opportunities for reciprocation, do people help strangers? One possible explanation is that helping is driven by receiving or observing help. In other words, generosity towards strangers may be socially contagious.\" Says Nabi: Your kindness influences a friend, who influences their friend, who influences their friend. \"This creates what is often termed as ' social contagion. '\" It's like a positive feedback loop, Nabi says: Feeling cared for makes you want to care for others. The 2025 World Happiness  Report  surveyed people from 147 countries. Interviewees spoke a simple truth: Doing something kind with no motive for gain made them feel better.   Nature or nurture? And where does kindness come from? Are you born with it? Or can you learn to be compassionate and empathetic? Jeff R. Temple , a professor and psychologist with UTHealth Houston, says kindness is a central thread running through his studies on healthy relationships among adolescents and young adults. \"In our intervention work — including with the  Fourth R program  and other school-based curricula — we teach adolescents to practice perspective-taking, to express care even during disagreement and recognize the impact of their words and actions. These are essentially the behavioral expressions of kindness.\" Such kids are less likely to bully others because they know what healthy relationships are like, he says. A ripple effect And let's not forget that kindness can change not only the life of the recipient of the kind deed but of the kind person, says Nabi, who offers this anecdote. In the 2013   Savar building collapse  in Bangladesh, where 1,040 garment workers were crushed under concrete. Rescue workers managed to pull out 2,400 people from the rubble two weeks after the collapse. Nabi arrived at the disaster site as a Red Cross volunteer, expecting to gain experience in trauma care. Instead, he says, the experience changed his psyche, teaching him about the nature of true kindness. \"In the midst of chaos, with bodies awaiting identification, kindness came down to being present during others' darkest moments,\" says Nabi. \"I performed CPR on workers I knew wouldn't survive. and when I couldn't save someone, I stayed by their side, holding their hand.\" \"Before Savar, I was mechanistic, rushing through clinical work like tasks,\" he recalls. \"The  image of workers who had embraced each other  as concrete crushed them — that final act of human kindness in the face of death — shattered my callousness completely.\" When he returned to the hospital, he listened to patients differently, giving them more of his time. He also urges doctors to volunteer for humanitarian causes to practice compassion. \"Kindness, I learned, is about showing up completely for another person's suffering,\" Navi reflects, \"and letting that experience fundamentally change who you are.\" So if you began reading this story with the thought that World Kindness Day is … a gimmick … it is a gimmick imbued with heart and hope.  It's a good reminder to practice kindness more, Dr. Kadiri says. \"And here's the beautiful part: When someone receives kindness, they don't just feel better, they become better.\" They may be inspired to perform their own act of kindness. And that, she says, makes the world a kinder, better place too. Your turn:  Readers! Have you ever had a life-changing moment because of an act of kindness.

2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Since September, more than 1,000 artists and labels including  Lorde ,  Björk  and  Massive Attack  have joined an international initiative to remove their music from Israel. The boycott, called No Music for Genocide, is straightforward: artists are asking their labels and distributors to geo-block their music so it cannot be streamed in Israel. According to the movement's  website , this act is \"just one step toward honoring Palestinian demands to isolate and delegitimize Israel.\" Despite a  fragile ceasefire  currently in place, No Music for Genocide organizers say they're continuing the boycott amidst  additional airstrikes  in Gaza. \"Boycott is one of the most effective and enduring efforts that one can take to fight a militarized, overtly violent, three-headed monster of a system,\" blues poet  Aja Monet , one of the participants, tells NPR. \"We're in a place where capitalism rules everything. The most effective thing we can do is to be strategic about where we put our resources.\" The musicians' coalition coincides with a  similar pledge  from some  Hollywood stars  to boycott Israel's state-funded film industry. In September, an independent United Nations commission of inquiry  concluded  that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and that countries helping to arm the Israeli government, like the United States, are complicit in the violence. Israel strongly denies that it is committing genocide — and some Israelis say the artists' efforts are misguided, because the boycott affects even those who oppose the war. In a statement to NPR, the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. condemned the musician-led protest. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The attempt to boycott Israeli culture under the banner of 'No Music for Genocide' is discriminatory, immoral and misguided,\" reads the statement. \"Such boycotts do nothing to advance peace or improve the lives of either Israelis or Palestinians. On the contrary, they deepen division and harm the very people they claim to support.\" Although the State Department also rejected the U.N. report, some American musicians are demanding action and accountability over the U.S. government's role in the attacks. \"As a U.S citizen, I have a connection to this genocide that is happening using my tax dollars. As a musician, I am sensitive — I think that is necessary for making art,\" composer and singer-songwriter  Julia Holter , another participant in the campaign, said in a statement shared with NPR. \"Every day for over a year and a half now, we have seen horror stories abound in Gaza, and every malnourished baby I see with horrific injuries, every mother or father I see hovered over their child targeted by a sniper makes me think of my child, makes me think of anyone I have ever loved. I feel a responsibility to do something, however small it may be.\" Historic precedents  The No Music for Genocide movement, which is a decentralized volunteer network of musicians and labels, cites the success of cultural boycotts against South Africa during apartheid as a major inspiration. While artists like  Hugh Masekela  and  Miriam Makeba  made music a core tenet of anti-apartheid activism, international artists also played an important role. In 1985, E Street Band guitarist  Steven Van Zandt  led dozens of musicians, including  Bruce Springsteen ,  Miles Davis  and  Rubén Blades , in the  Artists United Against Apartheid  effort to record \"Sun City.\" The hit single referred to a luxury whites-only resort where artists including  Queen  and  Linda Ronstadt  had performed; the song's lyrics criticized their actions and pledged to avoid playing there until the end of apartheid. In 2023, artists ranging from Pedro Pascal to Quinta Brunson called for a  ceasefire  amidst the conflict in Gaza, but No Music for Genocide is a musician-led boycott. In a statement shared with NPR, vocalist, guitarist and boycott participant Marisa Dabice of the band  Mannequin Pussy  said mainstream artists could make a real difference. \"Without the participation of major label artists, this boycott cannot grow in the way it needs to make the largest possible impact,\" she wrote. \"We live in a day and age where unified direct action can make an impact —- we just have to be focused and unrelenting.\" The No Music for Genocide website notes that all three major U.S. labels — Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group —  ceased   operations  in Russia shortly after the invasion of Ukraine and pledged to support humanitarian relief efforts. The group argues the same should be done on behalf of Palestinians. Yasir Razak of the shoegaze band Nabeel, one of the artists geo-blocking his music from Israel, says he sees a link between the war in Gaza and the way Western powers have historically intervened in the Middle East. Razak was born in Baghdad around the time of the first Gulf War and grew up in the U.S. during the Iraq War. Although the Iraq War and the current conflict are markedly different, he says, they're not entirely separate. \"What makes me most sad is the idea that folks in other countries can't be seen,\" he says, adding that this is often the case with people from the Middle East. \"We've gone to great lengths to dehumanize them to the point where we can carry out these kinds of attacks against the majority popular opinion.\" In September, a  New York Times  and Siena University  poll   found  that a majority of American voters oppose continued U.S. economic and military support for Israel in the war, a reversal from public opinion shortly after the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7 in 2023, which killed 1,200 people according to the Israeli government. In July, a Gallup poll  found  that 60% of Americans disapprove of Israel's military actions in Gaza which have killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Razak says he has mostly received positive feedback from his fans for participating in the boycott. One downside, he notes, is that some digital service providers include Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories in the geo-block as part of Israel. After hearing directly from an affected listener, Razak found a workaround to provide free downloads of his music on the music distribution platform Bandcamp. But he says beyond the logistics of where the music is or isn't accessible, there is an underlying anxiety that comes with publicly voicing his stance against the Israeli state. (Several artists NPR reached out to declined to comment on the boycott). \"Ultimately, this is a humanitarian issue. We've all been seeing videos coming out of Gaza. We've heard members of the Israeli government speaking about what their intentions are. I think any right-minded person would look at that and say this is something to take a stand against,\" Razak says. \"But the attempt to conflate that in any way with hatred or antisemitism has been so dangerous and paralyzing, and fear-inducing for those of us who really feel like there's a moral obligation for us to stand against.\" Backlash against musicians In April, Cornell University dropped R&B singer  Kehlani  as the headliner of a campus concert. In a  statement , University President Michael I. Kotlikoff wrote that Kehlani \"espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media.\" Kehlani has been an outspoken advocate for Palestinians; the  video  for their 2024 song \"Next 2 U\" features a quote from Palestinian-American poet Hala Alyan, along with the phrase \"Long Live the Intifada.\" (The Arabic word generally translates to \"uprising\" and has a  long history  within the context of the war in Gaza.) During their  performance  at NPR's Tiny Desk last year, Kehlani wore a  keffiyeh  — the traditional Arab headdress that's become a symbol for Palestinians — and stopped to address the audience. \"I want to take a second to say: Free Palestine. Free Congo. Free Sudan. Free Yemen. Free Hawaii. Free Guam,\" Kehlani said. \"It's deeper than this. I need everybody that's here right now, everybody that's watching, to step up, to use their voices.\" After Cornell's decision, New York nonprofit City Parks Foundation, which organizes the SummerStage concert series, also  cancelled  Kehlani's scheduled Pride performance following pressure from the mayor's office and citing \"security concerns.\" Brooklyn-based rapper  MIKE , who is participating in No Music for Genocide, curates an annual hip-hop festival in partnership with SummerStage. He tells NPR he cancelled this year's edition in solidarity with Kehlani. \"You have to sacrifice for a bigger purpose,\" he says. \"One of the things that I see people trying to do with hip-hop is further detach it from its political foundation, its anti-establishment foundation.\" MIKE says music played a key role in shaping his political awareness, and he hopes his involvement in the geo-block movement stirs something in listeners. He's already received messages from fans in Israel over the removal of his music; he says he hopes the boycott inspires deeper reflection on the oppression of Palestinians and all peoples. Impact on Israeli music fans But on the ground in Israel, the boycott has led to some confusion. Linda Dayan, a reporter for  Haaretz  based in Tel Aviv, says that while most participating artists' music has been pulled from SoundCloud, several discographies are still available on other streaming platforms like Spotify. Dayan says blocking the music is \"just a punishment\" for the many Israelis who have long-opposed the war in Gaza. \"I think if [artists] really do want to make an impact, they should be putting their money behind their morals when it comes to either donating to initiatives that ensure that Gazans can get the aid that they so badly need, and organizations — especially within Israel — who are doing this work on the ground, who are organizing these protests,\" Dayan says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She points to groups like  Standing Together , a grassroots organization of Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel working to promote peace and unity. Dayan says she worries that instead of bringing people together, the boycott could further alienate Israelis. \"There is a really big narrative among the Netanyahu government and among factions of the right: 'They don't hate you because of what we do, they hate you because of who you are,'\" Dayan says. \"These boycotts that target wide swathes of people without considering the work that they're personally doing with Palestinians, the work that they are doing against the government or toward a just peace is giving credence to that idea.\" For several participating artists, No Music for Genocide is not an end-all solution, but they say it's an important form of nonviolent action. Aja Monet says the boycott is only one part of a much larger collective resistance. \"Just as much as we're talking about what's happening in Palestine, we're talking about the rising state of fascism in this country,\" she says. \"We're talking about poverty. We're talking about the books that are being banned. We're talking about the immigrant community that's being attacked and kidnapped from their homes in their street corners. All of this is from the same arm of violence and threat and terror. All of those things concern us and we want an end to it.\" \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 13th, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misstated Quinta Brunson’s first name as Quinto. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604194","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:33:00-04:00","title":"A decade after the Bataclan attacks, France is still grappling with how to remember","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A decade after the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris — which killed 130 people at the Bataclan concert hall, cafés, and the national stadium — France continues to grapple with how to remember and process the trauma.

      By Rebecca Rosman \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 2:33 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PARIS — Arthur Dénouveaux's memories of Nov. 13, 2015, aren't exactly hazy. Nor are they perfect. \"What I remember from that night are a few very clear pictures,\" he says. Dénouveaux was one of around 1,500 people inside the Bataclan concert hall to see the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal, when gunmen linked to the Islamic State opened fire. What he remembers next are fragments. There was the muzzle flash coming out of the gunmen's Kalashnikovs. Being pushed to the floor as the crowd scrambled. A girl \"completely lost,\" staring toward the shooters before others pulled her down. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then Dénouveaux remembers crawling outside. \"Finding myself under the night sky in Paris,\" he says, \"and saying to myself, 'Hey, I'm free again.'\" Across Paris that night, 130 people were killed at cafés, the national soccer stadium and the Bataclan. Ten years later, France is still wrestling with how to remember the deadliest attack on its soil in modern history and how to live with it. The country has built an extensive system of remembrance. There have been books, documentaries, plaques and memorials across the city. A landmark 10-month terrorism trial ended in 2022 with the conviction of 20 men, including the only surviving member of the group that carried out the attacks. On Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron visited each of the attack sites before inaugurating a new memorial garden behind Paris City Hall. At the Place de la République this week, people placed flowers and lit candles at a makeshift memorial.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       For some, like Paris resident Anaelle Baheux, who lives just steps from one of the cafés attacked that night, these rituals still matter. \"It's reassuring to see that people didn't forget what happened,\" she says. But even as the rituals deepen, new research shows the details of that night are already fading from collective memory — and a study is offering insights into why some people recover from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, more easily than others.  Denis Peschanski, a historian, has been co-leading a 12-year study examining how the Nov. 13 attacks are remembered across French society. The project has followed nearly 1,000 people — survivors, victims' families, first responders and ordinary citizens — interviewing them at regular intervals to track how their recollections change over time. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's an interesting question, why did people forget,\" Peschanski says. He says one pattern stands out: While most people still remember the Bataclan vividly, their recollections of what happened at the cafés and the national stadium are \"foggier,\" if not forgotten altogether. For survivors from those sites, Peschanski calls this a \" double peine \" — a double punishment. They live not only with trauma, but also with the feeling that their part of the story has faded from public memory. Alongside the national memory study,  a team of neuroscientists  has spent the past decade studying trauma on an individual level, tracking about 200 survivors through regular MRI scans and psychological assessments. Pierre Gagnepain, one of the lead researchers, says early treatment approaches often discouraged the idea of intentionally trying to suppress traumatic memories. \"For a long time, people thought that suppression was not good, that trying to block memory made things even worse,\" Gagnepain says. \"People used to say it would cause even more intrusive memories.\" But their initial findings suggest the opposite: suppression can, in fact, be part of recovery. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What's important to understand is that forgetting — or suppression — doesn't mean you don't remember what happened to you,\" Gagnepain says. \"It's about making the memory less present, less vivid, less accessible. People can still describe what they went through. It's just that the memory becomes less intrusive, less invading.\" The science suggests that memory blurs not because people don't care, but because the mind adapts.  MRI findings from this study show that when memory control networks begin to recover — meaning when certain neural connections are strengthened and the brain's ability to inhibit intrusive thoughts is restored — survivors of traumatic events are less likely to suffer persistent intrusive symptoms of PTSD. But not everyone. About a third of survivors in the study remain \"chronic\" cases, stuck in a state where fear and memory remain tightly linked. Bataclan survivor Arthur Dénouveaux wasn't part of the MRI research, but he recognizes the distinction. He says his personal memories remain accessible without overwhelming him. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"You know, I can touch them.

Fourteen years later, the former Duke of York has been stripped of all his titles, including the princeship bestowed at birth. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — as he’s now known — was royally demoted two weeks ago by his brother, King Charles III, and faces eviction from the mansion where he’s lived rent-free near Windsor Castle. But the bad news keeps coming for the man who was once second-in-line to the throne. The recent trove of documents has renewed the sexual assault allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor and undermined his denials that he ever met his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre . They also reveal some of the efforts made behind the scenes to attack her claims. Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II, has vehemently denied all allegations by Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year. But he did settle a lawsuit out of court that reportedly paid her millions of dollars.

The scandal, however, resurfaced in 2019 when Epstein was arrested for a second time on charges of sex trafficking. Giuffre said she was 17 when she was trafficked to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor. In a disastrous attempt to clear his name, Mountbatten-Windsor did an interview with the BBC in which he denied ever meeting Giuffre and said he broke off contact with Epstein in December 2010. He was widely criticized for showing no empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with Epstein. His downfall over the past month began when other emails showed his Epstein friendship lasted far longer than he disclosed. Those revelations were followed by the publication of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir last month that detailed the three times she said they had sex. The new emails undercut Mountbatten-Windsor’s claim that a now-infamous snapshot of him with his arm around Giuffre’s partly bare midriff was doctored because he couldn’t remember it being taken. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote in one 2011 email in which he called Giuffre a liar. Epstein repeatedly disparaged Giuffre, calling her “nothing more than a telephone answerer.” He discussed getting a reporter to investigate her, suggesting “Buckingham Palace would love it.” When the Mail on Sunday sought comment before publishing a story in March 2011 about Giuffre’s allegations, Epstein forwarded the email to a contact listed as “The Duke” that is partly redacted but appears to be Mountbatten-Windsor. “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” the reply from the email listed as “The Duke” said. “I can’t take any more of this (on) my end.” When he asked Epstein how he planned to respond to the tabloid’s request, Epstein said he wasn’t sure. “The only person she didn’t have sex with was Elvis,” he wrote."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:45:35+00:00","title":"U.S. Ends Penny Production, Marking End of a 230-Year Tradition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States officially ended production of the penny on November 12, 2025, at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, marking the conclusion of over 230 years of use.

penny Wednesday, abandoning the 1-cent coins that were embedded in American culture for more than 230 years but became nearly worthless. When it was introduced in 1793 , a penny could buy a biscuit, a candle or a piece of candy. Now most of them are cast aside to sit in jars or junk drawers, and each one costs nearly 4 cents to make. “God bless America, and we’re going to save the taxpayers $56 million,” Treasurer Brandon Beach said at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia before hitting a button to strike the final penny. The coins were then carefully placed on a tray for journalists to see. The last few pennies were to be auctioned off.

But this is not the way we wanted it to go,” Jeff Lenard of the National Association of Convenience Stores said last month. Proponents of eliminating the coin cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers and the fact that some countries have already eliminated their 1-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012. Some banks began rationing supplies, a somewhat paradoxical result of the effort to address what many see as a glut of the coins. Over the last century, about half the coins made at mints in Philadelphia and Denver have been pennies.

Kennedy Jr.’s willingness to question established science and embrace nontraditional voices in the health care space, saying that often throughout history, “all the experts were wrong.” In remarks in a fireside chat between the two men at a “Make America Healthy Again” summit in the nation’s capital, Vance also propped up Kennedy’s MAHA movement , saying it has been “a critical part of our success in Washington.” Vance’s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress , has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change. “Of all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven’t been asking in a long time,” Vance told Kennedy onstage. The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press. Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines .

As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins. Critics, including some of the country’s leading medical associations, say that Kennedy’s disregard for established science is fomenting public distrust in mainstream medicine and that his views, once considered fringe, are being amplified from his perch as health secretary. “This closed-door convention is nothing more than an ego-stroking symposium of ‘wellbeing influencers’ and ‘MAHA moms’ whose rejection of scientific expertise puts our public health at risk,” said Erik Polyak, executive director of the progressive political action committee 314 Action, which works to elect Democratic scientists to office. Kennedy and his allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science. Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy’s network don’t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary’s close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease. “We’ve got to be comfortable challenging some of these old orthodoxies, and part of that is welcoming people that are a little unusual,” Vance said. Vance noted Kennedy’s interest in disrupting bureaucracy comes under a president with a similar mentality. “That is a good summary of Donald J. Trump is that he takes a bulldozer to Overton windows every single day,” Vance said. The Overton window refers to “the range of policies considered acceptable by the majority of a population,” according to Britannica.com. The MAHA event at a Washington hotel came on the heels of a different meeting in Austin, Texas, that welcomed several of the same attendees — the annual conference of Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy used to lead. That conference over the weekend, which featured Kennedy’s wife, Cheryl Hines, as a headline speaker, was more squarely focused on immunizations, with sessions such as “The Enduring Nightmare of COVID mRNA Technology” and “Understanding the Enormity of Vaccine Injury.” Wednesday’s packed house of Trump administration officials, biotech entrepreneurs, MAHA influencers and others included sessions about topics such as how artificial intelligence is being used in health care, reversing aging, making food healthier and more. MAHA Action, the Kennedy-supporting group hosting the event, said Trump’s embrace of the movement marks “a decisive turning point in U.S. health policy.” “Today is an important milestone,” Tony Lyons, president of MAHA Action, said in the release. “It’s the culmination of a movement that was 40 years in the making.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/louisville-plane-crash-kentucky-ups-531cc86733ad34d54b552556294cb89b","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"22:42:01+00:00","title":"14 Die in UPS Plane Crash Near Louisville Airport","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane crashed during takeoff at the company’s Worldport aviation hub at Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, killing 14 people.

(AP) — A grandfather and his young granddaughter. An electrician with two young children. A woman standing in line at a scrap metal business. They were among the 14 people who died in the fiery crash of a UPS plane in Louisville last week. Their names were released Wednesday as Mayor Craig Greenberg lamented the lives that will “forever be unfinished.” “As we share the names of those who we‘ve lost, our city feels the full weight of this unimaginable tragedy,” Greenberg said at a news conference. “Behind every one of these names is a circle of family, friends, stories that will forever be unfinished.” Eight days after the plane plowed into the ground in a massive fireball, the local coroner’s office said it completed the grim tasks of recovering victims’ remains, identifying them and notifying their loved ones. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board remain at the crash site , Greenberg said. Victims included three pilots on board when the crash happened during takeoff at UPS Worldport, the company’s global aviation hub located at Muhammad Ali International Airport. They were Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.

John Spray, 45, was killed at Grade A Auto Parts & Recycling when the plane crashed into the business. The mother of his child, Tifany Torok, said in a GoFundMe account for Spray’s daughter that he “was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” The family of Louisnes Fedon, 47, said “his death has created a sudden and immense void that goes far beyond emotional grief\"; a GoFundMe was set up by a friend of Fedon’s children. Like Spray, relatives say Fedon and his 3-year-old granddaughter, Kimberly Asa, were in the wrong place at the wrong time when the plane crashed to the ground just off the runway. Matthew Sweets, 37, was severely burned and died days later. He worked as an electrician and had two young children, Cohen and Rayne, according to his obituary. Another victim, Ella Petty Whorton, 31, was at the recycling business when the crash occurred. Her boyfriend, Eric Richardson, said they worked together collecting scrap metal to help make a living. They had been a couple for more than a year after being introduced by a mutual friend. “She was a great person,” Richardson said this week by phone. “Everybody loved her. I miss her so much.” Others killed in the crash were Angela Anderson, 45; Carlos Fernandez, 52; Trinadette Chavez, 37; Tony Crain, 65; John Loucks, 52; and Megan Washburn, 35. Officials haven’t publicly shared details about them, including where they were when the plane crashed. Greenberg credited the coroner’s office for “working tirelessly, under incredibly challenging conditions,” to recover the victims’ remains, identify them and notify the families. “I had a family member ask me yesterday, ‘how do you ever get used to this?’ And I said, ‘I don’t,” Jefferson County Coroner Jo-Ann Farmer. “If I get used to this and it doesn’t bother me anymore, I’m in the wrong profession.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/jefferey-epstein-donald-trump-documents-493aa8b123bbf52970586cf9ce19f498","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:38:58+00:00","title":"House Committee Releases Thousands of Emails Linking Jeffrey Epstein to Trump, Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee released thousands of emails and documents linking Jeffrey Epstein to influential figures such as Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton.

investigations"],"content":"Published: 2025-11-13T02:38:58+00:00\n\nA House committee released thousands of documents related to Jefferey Epstein on Wednesday, many of them emails the convicted sex offender sent to his rich or influential friends, or to reporters, over many years. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee initially released three emails where Epstein mentioned President Donald Trump. Republicans on the committee responded by disclosing the bigger trove of documents and accused the Democrats of cherry-picking a few messages out of context in an effort to make Trump look bad. Epstein served about a year in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from someone under age 18 but then went on to renew relationships with many influential figures in business, academics and politics. Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. Here’s some takeaways from the documents released Wednesday. Epstein said Trump ‘knew about the girls,’ but it’s unclear what he meant Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year , had said that Epstein’s longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago. Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn’t asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn’t been a member. “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added. In July, Trump said he had banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago because his one-time friend was “taking people who worked for me,” including Giuffre. Before her death, Giuffre said that she only met Trump once and that he was not among the people who abused her. She didn’t think Trump knew of Epstein’s misconduct with underage girls. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Democrats had leaked select emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.” Mentions of former Prince Andrew In lawsuits and interviews, Giuffre accused Epstein and Maxwell of pressuring her into sexual encounters with Britain’s former Prince Andrew, starting when she was 17 years old. Those allegations eventually cost Andrew — now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — his official titles and his royal residence near Windsor Castle. In 2011, Epstein emailed a reporter and attacked Giuffre’s credibility. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,” wrote Epstein, before arguing that “this girl is a total liar.” Epstein wrote that he’d ask if then-Prince Andrew’s “people” would cooperate with the reporter for a story. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre’s allegations. That same year, Epstein, whose writing paid little heed to grammar or spelling, also mentioned Giuffre and Trump in an email that Epstein sent to Maxwell. “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. virignia spent hours at my house with him,, he has never once been mentioned,” Epstein wrote. “I have been thinking about that,” Maxwell responded. In other emails, Epstein strategized how to respond to Giuffre’s stories, which included an account of meeting former President Bill Clinton on Epstein’s island in the Caribbean. “Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ).” Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein’s private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of the women who say Epstein abused them, including Giuffre. Relationship with the press Many of the documents were email exchanges between Epstein and journalists he had longstanding relationships with, or who solicited his insights on financial markets and Trump. He was asked, typically off the record, to weigh in on everything from the president’s relationships with foreign leaders to the impact of oil prices on wealthy families in Saudi Arabia. Epstein offered to broker introductions between journalists and powerful people numerous times. He also contested the accusations against him. In a 2016 email to a reporter, Epstein denied ever spending time with former President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore on his island. “You can also add, fresh politcal juice by stating that Clinton was never on the island,” Epstein wrote. “I never met Al Gore. No diners on the island either, no matter how much detail has been in the press.” ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C. and Michael R.

2025-11-13T01:23:06+00:00\n\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Alaska Native tribes and conservation groups sued the federal government Wednesday, seeking in at least three separate lawsuits to overturn a land exchange aimed at allowing a road to be built through a national wildlife refuge. Legal challenges to the land exchange agreement reached last month between Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and an Alaska Native village corporation include claims that it was not properly analyzed, that it poses risks to sensitive habitats and that it could threaten migratory birds that some Alaska Natives rely on for food. King Cove, a community of about 870 people near the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, has for years pushed to have a road built through the refuge for access to an all-weather airport at Cold Bay, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) away. Alaska’s governor and congressional delegation have supported the cause, calling it a life and safety issue that would allow for emergency medical evacuations. The delegation has said King Cove’s airstrip can frequently be closed for bad weather, and that high seas can make travel by water between King Cove and Cold Bay challenging. Terms of the agreement include conveyance by the government of about 490 acres (199 hectares) to King Cove Corp. for a potential road corridor, while the corporation would convey about 1,739 acres (703.7 hectares) to the refuge and relinquish selection rights to additional land. A decision document, signed by Burgum, says the proposed road would be about 19 miles, much of which would be within the refuge. It says it would be up to the corporation to obtain the necessary permits and funding for a road.

Follow on One of the lawsuits was filed by the Native Village of Hooper Bay, Native Village of Paimiut, Chevak Native Village and the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group.

The S&P 500 added 0.1% and neared its all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 327 points, or 0.7%, to set a record for the second straight day , while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Advanced Micro Devices was at the front of the market. It rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su said the chip company is expecting better than 35% of annual compounded revenue growth over the next three to five years. She credited “accelerating AI momentum.” Stocks benefiting from the artificial-intelligence frenzy have been shaky recently, as investors question whether how much more they can add to already spectacular gains. Their sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation . Their prices have shot so high , though, that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Nvidia came into the day with a 4.6% drop for the month so far, for example, after its stock price more than doubled in four of the last five years. The biggest player in AI chips swung between gains and losses throughout Wednesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 3.6% for one of the day’s larger losses in the S&P 500.

One way for stock prices to look less expensive is for companies to deliver big growth in profits. On Holdings jumped 18% after the Swiss shoe and apparel company reported a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It reported growth in sales from around the world, with the strongest coming from Asia. But even beating expectations may not be enough for some stocks. Circle Internet Group fell 12.2% even though it reported profit for the latest quarter that trounced analysts’ estimates. The issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies has seen its stock price fall since it got near $300 in June, just a few weeks after its initial price offering of $31. It’s now below $87. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.31 points to 6,850.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 326.86 to 48,254.82, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 61.84 to 23,406.46. Another way for stock prices to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying lower yields can encourage investors to pay higher prices for other kinds of investments. In the U.S. bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.06% from 4.13% late Monday after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Traders still see a nearly 2-in-3 chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. That’s despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a third cut for the year is far from a sure thing. Fed officials are worried about the potential of giving still-high inflation more fuel. The Fed has been in a difficult spot recently because the U.S. government has not been publishing its usual updates on the job market, inflation and other areas of the economy. That’s restricted its view of how things are going, though the nation’s longest-ever shutdown appears to be nearing an end . In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germany’s DAX returned 1.2%, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1% for two of the world’s bigger gains. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/epstein-emails-trump-house-democrats-db7df1042a73e610fb5deddf2f90bd3a","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:31:47+00:00","title":"Epstein Emails Reveal Alleged Trump Knowledge of Sex Trafficking, Sparking Political Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the release of 23,000 documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including emails referencing Donald Trump’s visits to Epstein’s house and alleged knowledge of his sex trafficking activities.

The White House quickly accused Democrats of selectively leaking the emails to smear the president. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three emails referencing Trump, including one Epstein wrote in 2011 in which he told confidant Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein’s house with a sex trafficking victim. The disclosures seemed designed to raise new questions about Trump’s friendship with Epstein and about what knowledge he may have had regarding what prosecutors call a yearslong effort by Epstein to exploit underage girls. The Republican businessman-turned-politician has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and has said he ended their relationship years ago. Trump did not take questions from reporters Wednesday, even after inviting them into the Oval Office to watch him sign legislation ending the government shutdown.

Epstein took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges. The emails made public Wednesday are part of a batch of 23,000 documents provided by Epstein’s estate to the Oversight Committee. Giuffre said Trump ‘couldn’t have been friendlier’ Giuffre, who died earlier this year , long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her. In a court deposition, she said under oath that she didn’t believe Trump had any knowledge of Epstein’s misconduct with underage girls. And in her recently released memoir , she described meeting Trump only once, when she worked as a spa attendant at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, and did not accuse him of wrongdoing. Giuffre wrote that she was introduced to Trump by her father, who also worked at the club. She described Trump as friendly and said he offered to help her get babysitting jobs with parents at the club. Trump “couldn’t have been friendlier,” Giuffre wrote. Other members of Epstein’s household staff also said in sworn depositions that, while Trump did stop by Epstein’s house, they didn’t see him engage in any inappropriate conduct. Republicans says emails released to tarnish Trump White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Democrats “selectively leaked emails” to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.” Trump, writing on his Truth Social platform, said Democrats “are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done” on the government shutdown “and so many other subjects.” “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!” Trump wrote. In July, Trump said he had banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago because his one-time friend was “taking people who worked for me,” including Giuffre. The women, he said, were “taken out of the spa, hired by him — in other words, gone.” “I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people,’” Trump told reporters. Asked if Giuffre was one of the employees poached by Epstein, the president demurred but then said Epstein “stole her.” Shortly after Democrats released the Trump-related emails, committee Republicans countered by disclosing what they said was an additional 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate. Among them were a trove of emails written over several years by Epstein, including many where he commented — often unfavorably — on Trump’s rise in politics and corresponded with journalists. Emails revive questions about Trump’s relationship with Epstein The release resurfaces a storyline that had shadowed Trump’s presidency during the summer when the FBI and the Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing additional documents that investigators had spent weeks examining, disappointing conspiracy theorists and online sleuths who had expected to see new revelations. <!-- The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: -->\nYour browser does not support the <code>iframe</code> HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later. In one 2019 email to journalist Michael Wolff , who has written extensively about Trump, Epstein wrote of Trump, “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” In an April 2, 2011, email to Maxwell, a former Epstein girlfriend now imprisoned for conspiring to engage in sex trafficking, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump. Virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” Maxwell replied the same day: “I have been thinking about that.” Leavitt said the person referenced in the emails is Giuffre, who had accused Britain’s then-Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager and who died by suicide in April. Andrew, who recently was stripped of his titles and evicted from his royal residence by King Charles III after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein, has rejected Giuffre’s allegations and said he didn’t recall meeting her. It wasn’t clear what Epstein meant by saying that Trump was a dog that “hadn’t barked,” but both he and Maxwell in other correspondence accused Giuffre of fabricating stories about her supposed sexual interactions with famous men. Leavitt said in a statement that Giuffre had “repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and ‘couldn’t have been friendlier’ to her in their limited interactions.” “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,” the statement said. “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump’s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.” Messages seeking comment were left with Wolff, Maxwell attorney David Markus and representatives for Giuffre’s family. Maxwell’s interview with the Justice Department Maxwell, interviewed in July by the Justice Department’s second-in-command, repeatedly denied witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions involving Trump. “I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche , according to a transcript of the interview. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.” Giuffre came forward publicly after an initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. He was released in 2009. This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017.

military’s unlawful revocation of their early retirement pensions and benefits. The lawsuit, filed in federal court Monday, comes several months after the Air Force confirmed that it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. It is just the latest in a series of legal challenges to the Trump administration’s policies that have sought to push transgender troops out of the military since the early days of his second term. The U.S. Supreme Court in May, however, allowed the ban on trans troops to be enforced while legal challenges proceed. According to GLAD Law , one of the advocacy groups that helped bring the lawsuit, service members affected by the policy will now face a loss of up to $2 million owed for their service over the course of their lifetimes in addition to the loss of health insurance benefits. Michael Haley, a staff attorney with the group, said the revocation of the early retirement benefits was part of “the general cruelty in attacking transgender people.” He noted that many of the plaintiffs had received orders allowing their retirements and that some had even begun the process of getting out of the military.

He told The Associated Press that “the military taught me to lead and fight, not retreat.” “Stripping away my retirement sends the message that those values only apply on the battlefield, not when a service member needs them most,” he added. “These are folks who are going to move on with their lives, have received the OK to do so, and then have that taken away from them once again,” Haley said. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to comment but has a longstanding policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation. President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal. Pentagon officials say 4,240 troops have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which the military is using as an identifier of being transgender. The Air Force has been unique in implementing policies that have gone beyond just separating troops from military service. In addition to revoking retirement benefits, the service moved in August to deny transgender members of the Air Force the chance to argue before a board of their peers for the right to continue serving. The Pentagon rolled out a similar , military-wide version of that policy less than two weeks ago."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1313-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A collection of global news items covering political developments, military conflicts, and humanitarian issues: the US House votes on releasing Jeffrey Epstein’s files, Ukraine faces rising conflict with attacks on oil facilities and political instability due to a corruption scandal, Paris mourns victims of 2015 attacks, Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring fighters, and a lawsuit alleges organized shooting activity involving Italy and Bosnia.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) opens in Belem, Brazil, with world leaders calling for global unity in combating climate change.

slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/president-donald-trump-government-shutdown-b3310df445ac5ee3bd41a40bc8bd9ccc","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:23:17+00:00","title":"Trump Ends 43-Day Government Shutdown Amid Partisan Gridlock and Federal Worker Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump ended a record 43-day government shutdown on November 13, 2025, by signing a funding bill that concluded a deep partisan dispute over the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits.

record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks. The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday. The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions — including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers — to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands. Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time. Here’s the latest: Related Stories Republicans promised health care negotiations after the shutdown, but Democrats are wary 5 MIN READ States scramble to send full SNAP food benefits to millions of people after government shutdown ends 4 MIN READ Federal workers question whether the longest government shutdown was worth their sacrifice 3 MIN READ Trump has the White House’s East Room will be part of the ‘future’ entrance of his ballroom The president was addressing an East Room event when he paused to indicate the huge, active construction site nearby where the ballroom is being built – and where the East Wing was demolished to make room. “In about two years from now, we’ll use a much bigger room,” Trump said, adding that the new ballroom’s entrance will be “right here” and suggested that the project might require removing more of the existing White House. “It looks pretty nice right now. It’ll look a lot better in a little while,” Trump said. He also said the ballroom has “really become very popular” – an assertion the president has frequently repeated that is not backed up by recent polling. Trump administration slaps terror designation on 4 left-wing groups in Europe The Trump administration is designating four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations, following through on the president’s vow to crack down on leftists after the September assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The networks all appear to be based in Europe, with no operations in the United States. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden. The designation allows the administration to target any financial support the networks may have in the U.S. Most anarchist and antifa, or anti-fascist, groups are technically not organizations but rather loose affiliations of individuals who join up for specific actions. First lady headlines executive order signing on foster youth First lady Melania Trump kicked off an East Room event on Thursday to promote an executive order meant to help current and former foster youth. Her husband, the president, is to sign the executive order shortly. Melania Trump said it was “truly inspiring to see everyone gather here together, united in support of this remarkable initiative.” 2 Smithsonian museums to reopen Two of the Smithsonian’s museums along the National Mall in Washington, D.C. – American History and Air and Space – were set to reopen Friday after people had been turned away from the free attractions for more than four weeks during the government shutdown. The organization says on its website that the rest of the Smithsonian’s sites across the Washington area and New York will reopen by Monday, on a rolling basis. All Smithsonian buildings and the National Zoo were first closed Oct. 12. Most of the Smithsonian museums are typically open every day of the year with just one exception for Christmas. The 20 sites together hosted more than 16 million people last year, and the organization has more than 3,600 federal employees. While the zoo has been closed, the popular livestream feeds capturing the famous giant pandas playing, rolling in the grass or eating were offline. The normally active social media pages sharing animal updates and colorful photographs were silent. Still, even during a shutdown, the animals continue to be fed and get care, unpublicized. The Education Department brings back staff members The Education Department said Thursday it had brought back all its staff members who were furloughed during the government shutdown or dismissed in the Trump administration’s round of mass firings in October. The administration laid off 466 Education Department staffers in the cross-government firings meant to pressure Democratic lawmakers over the shutdown. Those layoffs had been halted by a federal judge. The department furloughed 2,117 employees at the start of the shutdown, but some were brought back for essential work. New grants were put on hold during the shutdown. Most school districts received the bulk of their federal funding over the summer, but some grants that schools were counting on for this year have been delayed. Recipients of Impact Aid , which boosts the budgets of districts with large amounts of federal land that can’t be taxed for local schools, were waiting to learn when their payments would be processed. Justice Department sues to block California US House map The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026. The complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump . It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who’s seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender. “California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.” California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year’s midterm elections. Federal workers to receive backpay by Nov. 19 The Trump administration is working to push out pay for federal workers that had been on hold because of the government shutdown by the middle of next week. The money will go out in four separate tranches, depending on the agency, according to a senior administration official. The varied dates are because agencies are on different pay schedules and payroll providers. The White House had pushed federal agencies to expedite backpay for employees, said the official, granted anonymity to discuss the administration’s plans. The schedule is as follows: —Nov. 15: Employees at the General Services Administration and Office of Personnel Management will be paid a “supercheck” that covers the period of Oct. 1 to Nov. 1 —Nov. 16: Employees at the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1, as well as civilian employees at the Pentagon. —Nov. 17: Employees at the Departments of Education, State, Interior, and Transportation, as well as those at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Social Security Administration will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1. —Nov. 19: Employees from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Treasury and the Small Business Administration will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15. —By Seung Min Kim Voto Latino criticizes House for ignoring health crisis and voting ‘yes’ on budget bill On Wednesday evening the House voted on a budget bill that ended the longest shutdown in U.S. history . Voto Latino leaders said the House “chose to ignore the health crisis millions of Americans are facing” when it voted on a budget bill that they claim will jeopardize the health of Latino communities by failing to fund subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act that make health coverage more accessible . “Latinos are already left behind when it comes to accessing health care coverage,” Voto Latino leaders said in a statement. “With lawmakers choosing to turn a blind eye to this reality, these disparities will only grow, and families will be pushed to make difficult decisions when it comes to seeking medical attention.” Democratic Sen. John Fetterman hospitalized after fall U.S. Sen. John Fetterman had what his office says was a “ventricular fibrillation flare-up” that caused him to feel light-headed and fall during an early morning walk Thursday. He was doing well and was hospitalized in Pittsburgh, his office said. He sustained minor injuries to his face and was under “routine observation” at the hospital, the office said. Fetterman, who suffered a stroke in 2022, has disclosed that he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Cardiomyopathy can impede blood flow and potentially cause heartbeats so irregular they can be fatal. Atrial fibrillation can cause blood to pool inside a pocket of the heart, allowing clots to form. Clots then can break off, get stuck and cut off blood, causing a stroke. Wait and see on poverty program reimbursements The federal government is back but it is unclear when and if Washington, D.C., will be reimbursed for the payments it made to programs for its impoverished residents while the government was shut down. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered that the thousands of recipients of SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and the WIC program receive their benefits during the shutdown. The city ultimately covered $18.5 million of the SNAP expense after the federal government made a partial payment of $8 million at the direction of a federal district judge. Overall, it will be months before city officials know the full impact of the shutdown in terms of economics although at least budgetarily it will be a better outcome than 2024 when the city was unable to spend more than $1 billion of its own tax revenue on its budget because of action by the House. This year the city retained its spending authority on the budget the council passed. States scramble to send full SNAP food benefits to millions after government shutdown ends With the longest U.S. government shutdown over , state officials said Thursday they’re working quickly to get full SNAP food benefits to millions of people, though it still could take up to a week for some to receive their delayed aid. A back-and-forth series of court rulings and shifting policies from Trump’s administration has led to a patchwork distribution of November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program . While some states already had issued full SNAP benefits, about two-thirds of states had issued only partial benefits or none at all before the government shutdown ended late Wednesday, according to an Associated Press tally. The federal food program serves about 42 million people, about 1 in 8 Americans, in lower-income households. They receive an average of around $190 monthly per person, though that doesn’t necessarily cover the full cost of groceries for a regular month. ▶ Read more about the shutdown and SNAP food benefits Judge hears arguments challenging appointment of prosecutor who charged James Comey, Letitia James Lawyers for two of President Trump’s foes who’ve been charged by the Justice Department asked a judge Thursday to dismiss the cases against them, saying the prosecutor who secured the indictments was illegally installed in the role. U.S. District Cameron McGowan Currie didn’t immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan’s appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The requests are part of multiprong efforts by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to get their cases dismissed before trial. At issue during Thursday’s arguments are the complex constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of the nation’s U.S. attorneys, who function as top federal prosecutors in Justice Department offices across the country. ▶ Read more about the Justice Department cases Trump’s new ambassador visits head of Greece’s Orthodox Church Kimberly Guilfoyle, the first female U.S. ambassador to Greece and a close ally of President Trump, visited the head of Greece’s Orthodox Church on Thursday, telling him he was the first person she called after being nominated to her new post. Guilfoyle’s visit to Archbishop Ieronymos II came just over a week after she took up her new position in Athens. A former California prosecutor and Fox News host who was once engaged to Donald Trump Jr, the 56-year-old presented her diplomatic credentials to Greece’s president on Nov. 4. “It’s wonderful to be here and I’m just very grateful that President Trump has blessed me with the opportunity to serve the United States here in Greece, for the relationship that we have and for that growing and blossoming going forward,” Guilfoyle said during the meeting with the 87-year-old archbishop. Ieronymos extended his thanks “to the president for the opportunity that he gave us today. May God bless these relations.” ▶ Read more about the ambassador’s visit in Greece Funding bill renews Medicare telehealth program Medicare telehealth waivers that allow millions of older adults to get virtual health care without leaving home were restored through Jan. 30 in the government funding bill, after lapsing during the 43-day shutdown . Patients and caregivers reacted with relief — but called for more action. “We are pleased that Congress has worked together to temporarily restore the telehealth funding, but we hope they can make this a permanent part of the healthcare system,” said Martha Swick, a full-time caregiver for her husband Bill, who uses the program for speech therapy to treat his degenerative brain disease. The deal also restored funding through Jan. 30 for a Medicare program that allows some patients to receive hospital-level acute in-person care at home. Essential federal workers expected to get backpay soon, White House official says Federal workers deemed essential, including Capitol Police officers, TSA workers and air traffic controllers, had been forced to work without pay during the shutdown. But Kevin Hassett, chair of the National Economic Council at the White House, said their checks should soon be on the way. “I think that the payments will come probably come in the next week,” Hassett said. “Maybe even before.” Health care debate ahead It’s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber. Some Republicans have said they’re open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea. A bitter end after a long stalemate The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor. Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute. “They knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said. Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House on Wednesday “leaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,” said Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. Federal workers deeply felt the impacts of the shutdown The shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Throughout the shutdown, at least 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, while about 730,000 others were working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The plight of the federal workers was among several pressure points, along with flight disruptions and cuts to food aid , that in the end ratcheted up the pressure on lawmakers to come to an agreement to fund the government. Throughout the six-week shutdown, officials in President Trump’s administration repeatedly used the federal workers as leverage to try to push Democrats to relent on their health care demands . The Republican president signaled that workers going unpaid wouldn’t get back pay. He threatened and then followed through on firings in a federal workforce already reeling from layoffs earlier this year. A court then blocked the shutdown firings , adding to the uncertainty. Federal workers question whether the longest government shutdown was worth their sacrifice Jessica Sweet spent the federal government shutdown cutting back. To make ends meet, the Social Security claims specialist drank only one coffee a day, skipped meals, cut down on groceries and deferred paying some household bills. She racked up spending on her credit card buying gas to get to work. With the longest shutdown ever coming to a close , Sweet and hundreds of thousands of other federal workers who missed paychecks will soon get some relief. But many are left feeling that their livelihoods served as political pawns in the fight between recalcitrant lawmakers in Washington and are asking themselves whether the battle was worth their sacrifices. “It’s very frustrating to go through something like this,” said Sweet, who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York. “It shakes the foundation of trust that we all place in our agencies and in the federal government to do the right thing.” ▶ Read more about how federal workers felt about the shutdown OPM: Get back to it, federal workers The Office of Personnel Management posted on X that federal workers are expected to be back to the grind on Thursday, with Trump signing a measure ending the record 43-day shutdown . “Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are open. Employees are expected to begin the workday on time. Normal operating procedures are in effect,” the OPM posting says."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/indigenous-activists-storm-cop30-climate-summit-in-brazil-demanding-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:16:29+00:00","title":"Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including leaders from the Tupinamba community and organizers like Leo Cerda, protested at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding that their lands be protected from agribusiness, oil exploration, and illegal logging.

activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/cambodia-evacuates-hundreds-from-disputed-thai-border-as-tensions-reignite","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:54:30Z","title":"Cambodia evacuates hundreds from disputed Thai border as tensions reignite","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tensions between Cambodia and Thailand have escalated following a deadly shootout near the disputed border village of Prey Chan in Banteay Meanchey province, where a man named Dy Nai was killed and three others injured.

know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/colombia-says-will-maintain-intelligence-sharing-to-fight-drug-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:11:15+00:00","title":"Colombia to maintain US intelligence-sharing to fight drug trafficking","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a reversal just days after claiming to suspend collaboration, Colombia reaffirms its commitment to intelligence-sharing with US and international agencies to combat drug trafficking.

trafficking\n\nOfficials in Colombia say the country will continue to share intelligence with international agencies combatting drug trafficking, just days after President Gustavo Petro said he was suspending such collaboration with the United States over  attacks on vessels  in international waters.\n\nColombian Defence Minister Pedro Arnulfo Sanchez said in a social media post on Thursday that Petro had provided “clear instructions” to maintain a “continuous flow of information” with international agencies working on drug trafficking.\n\n“Against transnational crime, the answer is international cooperation,” Sanchez  wrote  on X.\n\nThe country’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti, also said in a separate statement that there had been “a misunderstanding” and Petro never said that US security agencies would stop working in Colombia alongside their Colombian counterparts.\n\n“We will continue working as this Government has done against drug trafficking and crime with the United States,”  Benedetti said  on social media.\n\nThe apparent about-face comes after Petro — a left-wing leader and vocal critic of US President Donald Trump —  said on Tuesday  that an order had been issued “to suspend communications and other dealings with US security agencies”.\n\nPetro has been critical of a series of deadly US attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration accused of smuggling illegal drugs.\n\nThe strikes have prompted widespread condemnation, with  United Nations officials  and other experts saying they amount to clear violations of international law.\n\n“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, said in late October.\n\n“The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”\n\nThe Trump administration has  rejected the criticism , saying its attacks in the Caribbean and the Pacific aim to deter drug traffickers. The US bombing campaign, which began in September, has killed at least 76 people to date.\n\nTrump, without providing any evidence, also has accused Petro of being involved in drug trafficking,  imposing sanctions  on the Colombian president and his family last month.\n\nThe Colombian leader has, in turn, called for Trump to be investigated for war crimes linked to the attacks, which have affected citizens from Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nPetro also has accused Washington of going after  peasants growing coca , the base ingredient of cocaine, instead of targeting major drug traffickers and money launderers.\n\nOn Sunday, Petro said that he met with the family of a Colombian fisherman who was allegedly killed in one of the US strikes.\n\n“He may have been carrying fish, or he may have been carrying cocaine, but he had not been sentenced to death,” Petro said during a summit between Latin American and European leaders hosted by Colombia. “There was no need to murder him.”\n\nUS news outlet CNN reported earlier this week that the United Kingdom had suspended some intelligence-sharing with the US over its strikes on the boats in the Caribbean.\n\nBut US Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected that report. Without going into any details or explaining what about CNN’s reporting was inaccurate, Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that the story was “fake”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/canada-moves-to-rebuild-trade-ties-with-india-after-years-of-tension","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:48:20+00:00","title":"Canada moves to rebuild trade ties with India after years of tension","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada is actively working to rebuild trade and diplomatic ties with India after a prolonged crisis stemming from allegations that the Indian government was involved in the 2023 assassination of Canadian Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

morgue after Israeli attack\n\nTwelve-year-old Raghad al-Assar lay unconscious in a Gaza mortuary for eight hours after she  was declared dead  following an Israeli attack on her home in central Gaza last year.\n\n“We were sitting in our home like everyone else when suddenly bullets, planes and drones came down on us,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nAl-Assar was saved by chance when a Palestinian man searching for his son’s body in the morgue saw the young girl’s fingers moving as she lay on a cold slab.\n\n“I was in a coma for two weeks, and when I woke up, my family told me that I had been placed in the morgue refrigerator,” she recounted.\n\nTwo of al-Assar’s sisters were killed in the attack on June 8, 2024, and other members of her family were hurt as well.\n\n“All my family was injured, and two of my sisters were martyred. My eldest sister’s condition is worse than mine. She can’t see in one eye, has burns, deep wounds and stomach problems,” al-Assar revealed.\n\nHer story is one of the many to emerge from Israel’s war on Gaza, which United Nations experts have described as a genocide.\n\nAccording to the UN Children’s Fund, some 64,000 children have “reportedly been killed or maimed” in Israeli attacks on coastal Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed at least 69,187 Palestinians and wounded 170,703 since its start in October 2023.\n\nAl-Assar’s father, Mohammed, was working when his house was attacked. A relative had called to tell him what happened.\n\n“News came to me that my house was targeted. I was at work, not at home. I rushed from work to the hospital to check what happened,” he said.\n\n“We went to the house to look for Raghad under the rubble. We did not find any sign of her.”\n\nAfter he  reunited with his daughter , Mohammed noticed the attack had completely changed her.\n\n“The incident that occurred to her changed her mental health and personality into another person,” he explained. “There would be incidents where we walk on the street, where she faints while we’re walking on the street.”\n\nAl-Assar told Al Jazeera she suffers from nightmares and anxiety whenever she recalls the day of the attack.\n\n“I don’t like to remember, don’t want to hear war sounds, and avoid things that bring back memories. If I hear bombing or planes, I get frightened,” she said.\n\nHer family is hoping to get al-Assar and her sister medical treatment abroad.\n\n“I want to go abroad for treatment. That is my dream,” al-Assar said. “It is a child’s right to live just like other people abroad — for them to have play and have wellbeing.”\n\nTwo years of Israeli bombardment across Gaza have destroyed many health facilities and killed hundreds of medics, resulting in the collapse of the territory’s medical infrastructure.\n\nWhile Hamas and Israel agreed last month to a ceasefire, Israel continues to conduct attacks on the enclave, and at least 260 people have been killed since the truce began on October 10."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is in the midst of a severe and worsening water crisis, marked by six consecutive years of drought, record-low rainfall, and the drying of 19 major dams—many of which feed Tehran.

Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/donald-trumps-disapproval-rating-jumps-to-58-percent-poll","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:01:42+00:00","title":"Donald Trump’s disapproval rating jumps to 58 percent: Poll","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new Reuters-Ipsos poll shows Donald Trump’s disapproval rating has climbed to 58% in November 2025, up from 52% in mid-May, while his approval rating remains steady at around 40%.

poll.\n\nBut Thursday’s survey, conducted by the news agency Reuters and the research firm Ipsos, found a jump in the share of respondents who said they disapproved of his performance.\n\nHis disapproval rating increased from 52 percent in mid-May to 58 percent in November.

Halligan, previously in Trump’s legal team, took over from Erik Siebert, who was removed under pressure from the president and failed to bring charges against either Comey or James. The legal teams argue that the prosecutions are retaliatory and that key procedural irregularities — including a missing court reporter during a critical portion of the grand jury proceedings and only 14 out of 23 grand jurors voting to indict Comey — undermine the legitimacy of the cases.

Her predecessor, Erik Siebert, had been forced out in September amid pressure from President Trump.\n\nInterim US attorneys may only serve a period of 120 days, after which point federal judges decide who can stay in the role. Siebert had gotten that approval. Halligan had not. It was instead the Department of Justice that named Halligan to the position of interim US attorney.\n\nLawyers for Comey and James have therefore maintained that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid.\n\n“The only thing that matters is whether Ms Halligan had a proper appointment when she stood before the grand jury, and she did not,” Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey’s lawyers, said on Thursday.\n\nThe Justice Department, however, has argued that the law does not prevent the appointments of successive interim US attorneys, nor does any ambiguity on the matter render Halligan’s indictments invalid.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Henry Whitaker called the concerns, at best, a “paperwork error” — and not a reason to throw out the charges.\n\nHalligan’s appointment in September corresponded with a series of indictments against Trump rivals and critics, including James — a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) — and James, the attorney general of New York state.\n\nComey was  indicted on September 25  for allegedly making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The case against him focuses on whether he lied to senators during his  2020 testimony  about the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian election interference in 2016.\n\nComey has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has likewise denied any wrongdoing in her case. On October 9, she was indicted on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution, both of which carry a maximum of 30 years in prison.\n\nA third Trump critic, former national security adviser, John Bolton, was also indicted on October 16 on charges related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents. He, too, has pleaded  not guilty .\n\nBolton was not part of Thursday’s court hearing.\n\nLawyers for Bolton, Comey and James have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president’s personal vendettas towards their clients.\n\nTrump had openly called for the Comey and James indictments in September, addressing a Truth Social post to Attorney General Pam Bondi that blasted the Justice Department for “all talk, no action”.\n\n“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” he  wrote  on September 20.\n\nHe also denounced Siebert for failing to bring cases against James and Comey, while praising Halligan.\n\n“There is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,” Trump wrote. “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.”\n\nAt Thursday’s hearing, Currie did not immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving.\n\nCurrie did, however, express scepticism about the Justice Department’s case.\n\nShe told the court that she had not been provided with a full transcript of the grand jury proceeding that led to Comey’s indictment.\n\nThe judge also noted that for part of the day of the Comey indictment — from 4:28pm local time until the moment when the indictment was returned — there was “no court reporter present” to take notes on the proceedings.\n\nThat leaves a gap in the documentation of the grand jury’s activities, Currie explained.\n\nShe indicated that it also creates a dilemma with one of the Justice Department’s arguments: that Attorney General Bondi had ratified the Comey indictment, along with Halligan.\n\n“It’s become obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the missing portion of the transcript, Currie said.\n\nIn a separate complaint ( PDF ) earlier this week, the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability also asked state bar authorities in Florida and Virginia to investigate Halligan over alleged violations of professional conduct.\n\n“Ms. Halligan’s actions appear to constitute an abuse of power and serve to undermine the integrity of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erode public confidence in the legal profession and the fair administration of justice,” the group stated in its complaint.\n\nCampaign for Accountability pointed out that, while Siebert refused to indict Comey and James, Halligan proceeded to do so despite scant evidence.\n\nIt also pointed out irregularities in how she procured the indictments from the grand juries involved.\n\n“In violation of customary practice, no career prosecutors from the US Attorney’s Office participated, and only 14 of the 23 grand jurors who heard the presentation voted to indict Mr. Comey,” the complaint reads.\n\nIt accuses Halligan of appearing to have “made false statements of material fact to both the grand jury and the district court” in both Comey’s and James’s cases.\n\n“The evidence appears to demonstrate that, absent President Trump’s intervention, neither Mr Comey nor Ms James would have been indicted,” it alleges."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/medical-experts-say-africa-faces-worst-cholera-outbreak-in-25-years","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:37:40Z","title":"Medical experts say Africa faces worst cholera outbreak in 25 years","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Africa is facing its worst cholera outbreak in 25 years, with over 300,000 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 7,000 deaths in 2025.

Burundi seeing renewed surges that suggest active transmission of the disease, according to African medical officials.\n\nOn Thursday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a public health agency for the African Union, said it had recorded about 300,000 confirmed and suspected cases of cholera so far in 2025. In addition, it had logged more than 7,000 deaths.\n\nThe figures show an increase of more than 30 percent over the total number of cases recorded last year, which was 254,075.\n\n“Cholera is still a major issue,” Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya said in a news briefing on Thursday. “It’s like every year we have more and more cases.”\n\nKaseya told reporters that two countries in particular have shown increases, suggesting active transmission of the infection: Angola and Burundi.\n\nAngola has seen at least 33,563 total cases of cholera so far in 2025, resulting in 866 deaths, and Burundi has experienced at least 2,380 cases, leading to 10 deaths.\n\nCholera is a bacterial disease usually spread when people drink contaminated water or have contact with the water through open wounds. In some cases, it is possible to become infected when eating raw shellfish.\n\nIt cannot be transmitted from person to person, so casual contact with a person who has the disease is not a risk.\n\nThe disease causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration. If the disease is left untreated, cholera can kill within hours — even among people who were previously healthy.\n\nThe Africa CDC blamed the rise of the disease on poor access to safe water and conflicts across the continent.\n\n“As we know, without water, we cannot really control the outbreak,” Kaseya said Thursday.\n\nEven in countries that have seen slight declines in cholera cases, Kaseya encouraged health officials to address the root causes, including overcrowding and poor sanitation in refugee camps.\n\n“Insecurity, displacement of our populations — all of that are not helping, in addition to a lack of wash commodities,” he said.\n\nAs of August , at least 40 people had died from cholera in Sudan’s Darfur region, with local refugee camps hit particularly hard.\n\nThe medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, described the situation as the country’s  worst outbreak in years .\n\nThe war in Sudan has damaged and destroyed much of the country’s civilian infrastructure, including sewage and water treatment works, and turned many places, including the capital Khartoum, into battlefields.\n\n“On top of an all-out war, people in Sudan are now experiencing the worst cholera outbreak the country has seen in years,” MSF said in a statement in August, cited by the AFP news agency.\n\n“In the Darfur region alone, MSF teams treated over 2,300 patients and recorded 40 deaths in the past week.”\n\nIn total, Sudan has experienced at least 71,728 cases of cholera in 2025, resulting in 2,012 deaths, according to the Africa CDC.\n\nCholera is not new to Sudan. In 2017, a previous outbreak killed at least 700 people and infected about 22,000 in less than two months. In this most recent outbreak,  officials speculate  that water supplies became contaminated with cholera due to the floodwaters mixing with sewage."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/france-commemorates-10th-anniversary-of-deadly-paris-attacks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:23:35+00:00","title":"‘Pain remains’: France commemorates 10 years of Paris attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France commemorated the 10th anniversary of the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, in which 130 people were killed and many more injured.

and around Paris , with President Emmanuel Macron stressing that the country continues to heal in the aftermath of the deadly assaults.\n\nISIL (ISIS) attackers  carried out bombings and opened fire in coordinated attacks on cafe terraces, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall on November 13, 2015, turning the French capital into a scene of calamity.\n\n“The pain remains,” Macron wrote on

their respects to the victims on the 10th anniversary of the attacks, observing a minute of silence and laying wreaths in front of the Stade de France, the national stadium of France, which was also targeted on that bloody day.\n\nThroughout the day, Macron, survivors and relatives of the victims will honour those killed and wounded at each of the sites of the attacks.\n\nVictims’ associations say two survivors of  the attacks  later died by suicide, bringing the total death toll to 132.\n\nSophie Dias’s father, Manuel, was killed in a suicide bomb blast outside the national stadium.\n\n“Since that November 13, there is an emptiness that cannot be filled,” Sophie said at Thursday’s ceremony outside the stadium.

You just learn to live differently.”\n\nThe commemorations will culminate with the inauguration of the “November 13 Memory Garden”, a new memorial garden opposite City Hall.\n\nConceived with victims’ associations, it is a stone enclosure from which granite blocks rise to evoke the attack sites, engraved with the victims’ names.\n\nCities in the United Kingdom, Belgium and Germany also suffered high-profile attacks at the hands of ISIL in the immediate years that followed before the group was vanquished on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/italys-pm-meloni-determined-to-continue-sending-migrants-to-albania","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:29:22Z","title":"Italy’s PM Meloni determined to continue sending migrants to Albania","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is pushing forward with a policy to send migrants and asylum seekers to Albania for detention and processing, under Italian legal oversight, despite strong opposition from Italian judges, human rights groups, and the European Court of Justice.

migrants to Albania\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has doubled down on her government’s plans to send migrants and asylum seekers to detention centres in Albania, despite opposition from Italian judges and the European Union’s top court.\n\nSpeaking at a summit in Rome alongside Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, Meloni said her right-wing government was “determined” to forge ahead with its scheme of sending migrants and asylum seekers outside the EU while their claims are processed.\n\n“Certainly, the protocol will work when the new [EU] migration and asylum pact comes into effect,” Meloni said on Thursday, citing a legal framework slated for 2026.\n\n“When the migration and asylum pact comes into effect, the centres will operate exactly as they should have from the beginning.”\n\nIn a separate deal  approved by the Albanian Parliament  in February 2024, Albania agreed to hold up to 3,000 migrants and asylum seekers at any one time in two Italian-run processing centres located near the port of Shengjin.\n\nUnder the plan at the time, the migrants and asylum seekers would be held for periods of about a month. It was expected that up to 36,000 people a year could be sent from Italian custody to Albania over an initial period of five years.\n\nAccording to the deal, people would be screened initially on board the ships that rescue them before being sent to Albania for further screening.\n\nThe centres were meant to be operated under Italian law with Italian security and staff. Italian judges would hear the immigration cases via video from Rome.\n\nThe agreement was denounced by rights groups, with the International Rescue Committee describing it as “ dehumanising “. Amnesty International condemned it as “illegal and unworkable”.\n\nAs of August 1, Italy saw 36,557 migrant arrivals in 2025. That number is slightly up from the same period of 2024, but far below the 89,165 recorded over the same time span in 2023.\n\nFollowing parliamentary approval, Italy  sent its first ship  carrying asylum seekers and migrants — 10 men from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — to Albania’s Shengjin port in October 2024.\n\nBut very quickly, four of the men were identified as “vulnerable” and sent back to Italy. Within two days, the remaining 12 men were sent back too, after an Italian court ruled against their detention.\n\nItaly then sent ships of asylum seekers to Albania in  January  and  April  2025, despite court challenges.\n\nMeloni’s plan has been mired in legal challenges from the start. Italian judges have repeatedly rejected deportations from the centres, ruling that the asylum seekers’ countries of origin were not safe enough for them to be sent back.\n\nThe cases were referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which had earlier established that asylum applicants could not undergo a fast-track procedure for repatriation if their home countries were not deemed safe.\n\nThe ECJ  ultimately backed Italian judges  in a ruling in August, questioning Meloni’s list of “safe countries”.\n\nMeloni’s government had issued a decree establishing a list of 19 supposedly safe countries of origin, which includes Egypt and Bangladesh. However, the EU has not classified either as a safe country of origin.\n\nThe ECJ said Italy is free to decide which countries are “safe”  but warned that such a designation should meet strict legal standards and allow applicants and courts to access and challenge the supporting evidence.\n\nThe ECJ also said a country might not be classified “safe” if it does not offer adequate protection to its entire population, agreeing with Italian judges who had raised the same issue last year.\n\nThe detention facilities in Albania have been empty for months due to the judicial obstacles. Earlier this year, a report found that their construction cost was seven times more than that of an equivalent centre in Italy."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/could-ukraines-corruption-crisis-lead-to-military-defeat-against-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:32:02+00:00","title":"Could Ukraine’s corruption crisis ‘lead to military defeat’ against Russia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major corruption scandal involving former business partner Timur Mindich and allies of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has erupted in Ukraine, centered on alleged bribes and kickbacks from contracts with the state-run nuclear power company Energoatom.

involves President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s business partner, political allies, and a cast of presumed wrongdoers who profited from a nuclear power monopoly has roiled energy-starved Ukraine.\n\nObservers told Al Jazeera that the scandal may ruin Zelenskyy’s approval ratings, enrage Western donors and cause a political crisis that could lead to battlefield losses.\n\n“What’s actually happening is the marauding of a state-owned company during the war, and that’s very painful for the people,” Tetiana Shevchenko of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.\n\nTimur Mindich, who co-owned the District 95 comic troupe that propelled  Zelenskyy  to stardom and a subsequent presidency, is the presumed mastermind of the corruption scheme around contracts with Energoatom, the state-run consortium that manages Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, according to two anticorruption agencies.\n\nRussian missiles and drones keep destroying Ukraine’s energy generation and distribution infrastructure, and nuclear power stations have become the nation’s main source of electricity.\n\nMindich, 46, fled Ukraine hours before investigators knocked on the door of his luxurious apartment in central Kyiv on Monday. He has reportedly travelled to Israel.\n\n“Catching businessman Timur Mindich was almost impossible; his flight is not a surprise,” a law enforcement source told the NV.ua broadcaster.\n\nA day later, two independent corruption watchdogs charged Mindich and seven more people with bribery, abuse of office and illegal enrichment from kickbacks of up to 15 percent from contracts with Energoatom that amounted to about $100m.\n\nThe agencies, Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), released video and audio recordings in which the group appears to use nicknames and codewords to discuss bribes and kickbacks amounting to tens of millions of dollars.\n\nZelenskyy,  whose anticorruption presidential campaign resonated with voters in 2019, tried to curb the autonomy of both agencies in July after they opened investigations into his allies and former business partners. But he has now backed down and pledged to keep them independent after massive popular protests.\n\n“Any anticorruption actions that yield results are very important; we need the inevitability of punishment,” Zelenskyy said on Monday. “There must be convictions.”\n\nBut anticorruption expert Shevchenko dismissed his statement.\n\n“That’s not a response. It’s like saying, ‘Let the court decide,’” she said.\n\n“It was Zelenskyy who brought these people to power; they used his name when appointing ‘overseers’ for the energy company,” she said.\n\nThe investigation’s results were released on YouTube by NABU and offer a look at the group, their secrecy measures and actions.\n\nUkrainians are gripped by the scandal, which has been front-page news since Monday. About 200,000 people have viewed the YouTube video.\n\nMindich, who goes by “Karlsson”, a character of a Swedish children’s book, is heard talking to “Rocket”, or Ihor Mironyuk, an ex-adviser to Justice Minister German Galushchenko.\n\nHaluschenko was suspended on Wednesday. After Ukrainian lawmakers urged him to quit, he  submitted  his resignation.\n\nEnergy Minister Svitlana Grinchuk also resigned on Wednesday after anticorruption officials said she had spent several nights in Haluschenko’s apartment and may have been involved in the scandal.\n\nOne more alleged mastermind, nicknamed Tenor, is Dmytro Basov, a former prosecutor and a head of Energoatom’s security department.\n\nAnother alleged group member, nicknamed “Sugarman”, is Oleksandr Tsukerman. He already faces a money laundering probe in the United States and has also fled Ukraine, the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported.\n\nThe group allegedly paid “Che Guevara”, or former deputy prime minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, $1.2m and 100,000 euros ($116,000).\n\nThey, however, chose to pay him with old banknotes, they said.\n\n“It’s a pity to give Che Guevara the nice” banknotes, one of the staffers of a “laundry”, an office equipped in a medical clinic in Kyiv, is heard saying.\n\nChernyshov was fired in July after being accused of bribery and money laundering through the construction of luxurious mansions.\n\nEnergoatom’s management has long been accused of corruption.\n\nAn industry insider  told  Al Jazeera in 2019 that Energoatom’s head, Petro Kotin, was allegedly involved in opaque deals, hiding financial information and firing experienced technical staffers and managers for whistleblowing.\n\n“They get crazy kickbacks. This is a team of marauders,” Olga Kosharna, a nuclear safety expert with decades of experience as a state nuclear regulation inspector, said at the time.\n\nThe scandal resembles a “prelude” to a long television series that will attract Ukrainians for years to come, according to Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelenskyy’s political opponents “will be greatly tempted to launch a large-scale attack on the president”, Fesenko told Al Jazeera.\n\nSuch an attack would have been normal in a peaceful Ukraine, but during the war, it may trigger a “domestic political crisis that can significantly weaken the state, and in the worst case, lead to military defeat”, he said.\n\nHe warned, however, that “the case’s loud start doesn’t guarantee its successful ending.”\n\nFesenko referred to the Amber Affair – an investigation into two lawmakers who allegedly accepted bribes from the “amber mafia” that illegally mines the semiprecious stone in central Ukraine.\n\nThe investigation was opened in 2017 with much fanfare and the presentation of secretly recorded audio and video evidence.\n\nBut it did not result in convictions after judges said they could not accept the illegally collected evidence.\n\nPetro Poroshenko, president at that time, pledged to adopt a law regulating amber mining, but it never materialised.\n\nMindich is also reportedly connected to Firepoint, a Ukrainian company that produces deep-strike drones, aerial surveillance equipment and missiles.\n\nMindich denied ties to Firepoint, but the company is being investigated for  corruption  after winning a string of lucrative government contracts.\n\nGermany has footed some of the bills, and the scandal may jeopardise Berlin’s future military aid.\n\n“The lobbyists of this initiative in Germany now look thick as thieves,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said that the scandal is emblematic of wider corruption that often involves military procurement, embezzlement of foreign aid and even relations between officers who reportedly extort bribes from servicemen who want to take leave.\n\n“Unfortunately, systemic corruption and decision-making based on it define the character of hostilities and the attitude of Ukraine’s population to their personal defence of such a region – something that leads to heavy consequences on the battlefield,” Mitrokhin said.\n\nWhat enrages Ukrainians is that the scandal looks like a repetition of another political disaster that ruined Zelenskyy’s predecessor.\n\nPetro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s richest man and former foreign minister, was elected president after a 2014 anti-Russian popular uprising, promising to root out Ukraine’s endemic corruption.\n\nFive years later, an investigative report identified his childhood friend and ally as the mastermind of a scheme to sell smuggled, second-hand Russian military equipment to Ukraine’s Defence Ministry at exorbitant prices.\n\nPoroshenko was booed off the stage during his campaign tour and lost the 2019 election to Zelenskyy, a popular comedian and first-time politician who also promised to root out corruption.\n\n“That’s what Zelenskyy beat Poroshenko during the elections with,” anticorruption activist Shevchenko said.\n\n“And he also promised, said, that he would literally put his friends in prison”, in case something similar happens, she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/italy-probes-sarajevo-sniper-safaris-what-were-they-who-was-involved","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:33:27Z","title":"Italy probes Sarajevo ‘sniper safaris’: What were they, who was involved?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Italy has launched a formal investigation into allegations that wealthy Italian citizens participated in 'sniper safaris' to Sarajevo between 1992 and 1996, during the Bosnian siege, where they allegedly paid to shoot at civilians under the direction of Bosnian-Serb forces.

who was involved?\n\nItaly’s public prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation into claims that Italians travelled on weekend “sniper safaris” to Sarajevo to shoot at citizens during the Bosnian-Serb army’s siege on the city that killed more than 11,000 people between 1992 and 1996.\n\nThe alleged “safaris” – a grotesque reference to expeditions to hunt or observe wild animals – took place as the Bosnian-Serb force besieged the city in what became the longest siege on a city in modern European history.\n\nMilan’s investigation, headed by prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis, was launched after journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, in collaboration with lawyers Nicola Brigida and former judge Guido Salvini, filed a legal complaint of “murder aggravated by cruelty and despicable motives” against alleged groups of Italians travelling to Sarajevo to join the trips.\n\nAccording to Italian media, investigators hope to track down people who participated in the alleged “safaris”, in addition to five men who have already been identified in Gacazzeni’s suit.\n\nGavazzeni, who has turned all his evidence over to prosecutors, told the Italian news outlet La Repubblica on Tuesday that his suit “exposes a part of society that hides its truth under the carpet”.\n\n“Because we’re talking about wealthy people with reputations, entrepreneurs, who during the siege of Sarajevo paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians,” he added.\n\nHere’s what we know about the alleged “sniper safaris”.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1996, Italian citizens and others who were mainly gun enthusiasts would gather in Trieste, northwestern Italy, on the border with former Yugoslavia on Fridays for a weekend of “hunting”. It remains unclear who arranged the trips for the alleged groups to take.\n\nParticipants would then allegedly be flown by the Yugoslav/Serbian Aviogenex airline to the hills surrounding Sarajevo, where they would pay Bosnian-Serb militias loyal to President Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison after a 2019 appeal, to shoot at citizens.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, these “tourists” paid up to 100,000 euros ($116,000), adjusted for current inflation rates and currency change, as the euro was not introduced until 1999, to join trips to Sarajevo to commit the killings.\n\nGavazzeni claims that participants would be given a price list for the type of kill that foreigners would pay for who they wanted to target, with children costing the most, then men, women and elderly people, who could be killed free of charge.\n\n“[A participant] left Trieste for the manhunt. And then he returned and continued his life as usual, respectable in everyone’s eyes,” Gavazzeni said.\n\n“People with a passion for weapons, to indulge, who prefer to go to bed with a rifle, with money at their disposal and the right contacts of facilitators between Italy and Serbia. It’s the indifference of evil: becoming God and remaining unpunished,” he added.\n\nGavazzeni’s 17-page filing includes the testimony of Edin Subasic, a Bosnian military intelligence officer who claims he and some colleagues informed Italy’s military intelligence agency, Sismi, about reports of Italians who would fly from Trieste to Sarajevo to take part in early 1994. In his testimony, he stated that the Italian intelligence service told him it had “put a stop” to the trips a few months later.\n\nThe Sismi report said it had discovered the departure points in Trieste and had interrupted the operation.\n\nAnother witness cited in the filing gave Gavazzeni details of three men who are now being investigated, who come from Turin, Milan and Trieste. According to a Sismi report, cited in the lawsuit, the man from Milan who took part in the shootings in 1993 was the owner of a private plastic surgery clinic.\n\nFormer Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic also sent a case file to the Milan Prosecutor’s Office on these “rich foreigners engaged in inhumane activities”, Italian news agency, ANSA, reported.\n\nSerbia has denied any involvement in the killings, but investigators believe that Serbian intelligence services were aware of the tourist trips.\n\nAccording to testimony from Subasic, the Bosnian military intelligence officer who is expected to be one of the first people summoned by the prosecutor’s office, the way that the trips were organised with the airline carrier pointed to the Serbian State Security Service being “behind it all”, ANSA reported.\n\nWhile Sismi was informed about the first trip, the official told La Repubblica it was never discussed again between the Bosnian and Italian spy agencies.\n\nThe Bosnian consul in Milan, Dag Dumrukcic, told La Repubblica on Tuesday that his government was working in “full cooperation in the investigation”.\n\n“We are eager to uncover the truth of such a cruel affair and settle accounts with the past. I have some information that I will pass on to the investigators,” Dumruckic added.\n\nDzemil Hodzic, 42, who grew up in Sarajevo in the 1990s and was nine when the siege began, is the founder of the  Sniper Alley Photo  project, which archives photographs taken during the siege. He told Al Jazeera that the findings came as no surprise to him, as the weekends were always “especially dangerous” in Sarajevo at the time.\n\nHodzic said there was always “information circulating about the people from outside coming to shoot at us”.\n\n“It is a well-known fact, but, unfortunately, it means nothing when the murderers and snipers who were shooting at us for four years are at large and we see that our Bosnian prosecutor’s office is doing nothing about it. I just hope that this case from Italy won’t disappear from our media space and that we will actually have some positive results,” he said.\n\n“My brother was killed by a Serb sniper while he was playing tennis in our neighbourhood. We will never know if it was one of those who paid to do so,” he added.\n\nIt is believed that citizens of multiple countries took part. In 2022, Bosnian film director Miran Zupanic’s documentary, Sarajevo Safari, investigated wealthy foreigners who had participated, including some from the United States and Russia.\n\nOne notable example was Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov, who was filmed during a documentary on the Bosnian war by Pawel Pawlikowski in 1992, shooting a machinegun towards the city of Sarajevo while personally accompanied by Karadzic.\n\nMoreover, in 2007, former US Marine John Jordan testified to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that “tourist shooters” had come to Sarajevo.\n\n“It was clearly obvious that the person being led by men who were familiar with the ground was completely unfamiliar with the ground, and his manner of dress and the weapons they carried led me to believe they were tourist shooters,” Jordan told the court."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/pakistan-says-islamabad-south-waziristan-bombers-were-afghan-nationals","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:51:38+00:00","title":"Pakistan says Islamabad, South Waziristan bombers were Afghan nationals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi stated that both suicide bombers in recent attacks—targeting the Islamabad District Judicial Complex and a Cadet College in South Waziristan—were Afghan nationals, escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, which includes platforms such as Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

2025-11-05T06:55:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/us-shutdown-ends-what-happens-now-when-will-services-resume","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:31:23+00:00","title":"US shutdown ends: What happens now, when will services resume?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 43-day government shutdown in the United States ended after President Donald Trump signed a finance bill passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives.

2025-11-13T14:31:23+00:00\n\nTitle: US shutdown ends: What happens now, when will services resume?\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump  signed a new government finance bill  on Wednesday, ending a Republican-Democrat standoff over the bill and the longest government shutdown in US history.\n\nThe federal shutdown, which began when Democrats in the Senate refused to sign off on the finance bill unless it included amendments to extend healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans, which the Republicans refused, dragged on for 43 days and left government workers without pay and agencies paralysed without funding.\n\nTrump signed the new bill hours after the House of Representatives voted to approve a package  passed earlier by the Senate  that would reopen federal departments and restart food assistance programmes.\n\n“With my signature, the federal government will now resume normal operations,” Trump said late on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees were furloughed – sent home without pay – according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Thousands of essential workers, including police, FBI and air traffic controllers, were required to continue working without pay.\n\nNow that a finance bill has been approved by Congress and signed by Trump, furloughed employees will return to work and will receive back pay.\n\nAmong other things, the bill authorises funding for food assistance programmes such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – also known as “food stamps” – and the legislative branch of government until the end of January 2026.\n\nHowever, the bill does not extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which Democrats had been demanding before they would agree to pass the funding bill. Tax credits for this scheme – which was passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama to expand health insurance coverage and which benefits more than 22 million low-income Americans – are due to expire on December 31.\n\nCentrist Democrats and Republicans have agreed, instead, to hold another vote in December to decide on the healthcare subsidies separately. However, there is no guarantee that an extension of those subsidies will be approved.\n\nHealthcare subsidies were at the heart of Democrats’ demands during the funding battle. When the initial bill was  proposed  by Senate Republicans, most Democrats opposed it. Republicans refused to back down on subsidies, meaning no agreement could be reached, and the bill was not approved by Congress.\n\nDuring a series of votes in the 43 days since the government shutdown began, Democratic senators rejected reopening the government on 14 occasions, insisting on extensions to the ACA tax credits.\n\nHowever, six Democratic senators and two independents finally broke ranks and voted with the Republicans in the Senate on November 9.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was one who voted against the measure, saying “for months and months, Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis. This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed.”\n\nHowever, Schumer  was criticised  by some Democratic senators and representatives for not joining the Democratic senators who caved and joined the Republicans because they wanted to end the shutdown. Some demanded that Schumer step down from his position as minority leader.\n\nWhen the bill to reopen the government moved to the House of Representatives, many Democrats there continued to  oppose it , including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n“We’re not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people,” Jeffries said in a news release issued by his team on Tuesday evening.\n\nOther Democrats in the House also opposed the measure. “To my colleagues: Do not let this body become a ceremonial red stamp from an administration that takes food away from children and rips away healthcare,” said Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill during her last speech on the US House floor before she leaves Congress to assume office as the new governor of New Jersey.\n\nUltimately, the opposing Democrats were defeated.\n\nThe US House of Representatives includes 219 Republicans, 214 Democrats and two empty seats. The bill passed in the House with a 222-209 vote.\n\nA total 216 House Republicans voted in favour of the finance bill. They were joined by six House Democrats who wanted an end to the shutdown: Henry Cuellar from Texas, Donald Davis from North Carolina, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez from Washington, Jared Golden from Maine, Adam Gray from California and Thomas Suozzi from New York.\n\nThe remaining 207 Democrats voted against the bill. They were joined by Republicans Thomas Massie from Kentucky and Greg Steube from Florida. One Democrat, Bonnie Watson Coleman and one Republican, Michael T McCaul, did not vote.\n\nWashington, DC-based newspaper The Hill reported that Massie’s vote against the bill was expected. He typically votes against spending bills, even if the bills are drafted by his own party, if he considers the levels of spending unreasonable.\n\nMassie also reposted an X post by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul – the only Republican to vote against the measure in the Senate – who argued that the bill contained unnecessary provisions that would harm Kentucky’s hemp farmers and small businesses.\n\nIn an X post on Wednesday, Steube wrote that he opposed the bill because the resolution included a measure allowing certain senators to personally sue the Justice Department using taxpayer money to fund their legal action.\n\n“I could not in good conscience support a resolution that creates a self-indulgent legal provision for certain senators to enrich themselves by suing the Justice Department using taxpayer dollars,” Steube wrote.\n\nA return to normal government is “easier said than done”, Scott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at the Ireland-based University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“You’ve got to restore staff, you’ve got to restore services, you’ve got to restore payments.”\n\nFurloughed employees could return to work as early as Thursday. It is unclear how soon government operations and services will resume fully, however.\n\nLucas also said that based on the measure passed, the US government now has to ensure that the furloughed employees stay on their jobs and are not fired, “which the Trump administration has threatened to do”.\n\n“There are going to be disruptions and, of course, the big thing is you will not get back that estimated $7bn to $14bn in lost productivity,” Lucas said. That is the estimated cost to the economy – roughly 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this quarter – caused by the delayed salaries of furloughed employees during the shutdown.\n\nThe funding for SNAP, which more than 40 million Americans benefit from, ran out on October 31, and the Trump administration blocked the programme from accessing emergency funds from the US Department of Agriculture’s disaster and nutrition assistance accounts.\n\nThis week, a spokesperson for the White House budget office said that the food assistance roll-out would begin within hours of the government reopening.\n\nBut recipients could still face lengthy delays. “Those payments will now have to be arranged, which means that, you know, you have a backlog that, that you’ll have to get through,” said the spokesperson.\n\nOn Friday last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order to 40 airports to reduce flights by 6 percent because of the shortage of air traffic controllers caused by the shutdown.  Hundreds of domestic flights were cancelled , causing havoc for travellers. If the government shutdown had not ended, this had been expected to be extended to 10 percent of flights.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that air traffic controllers will receive 70 percent of their pay within 24 to 48 hours of the shutdown ending.\n\n“Right now, he’s urging the air traffic controllers to continue to work without pay until that’s resolved,” Lucas explained.\n\nOn Wednesday, the New York Times cited unnamed representatives of the airline industry, estimating that flights could return to normal within a week of the shutdown ending.\n\nFor flights to resume as usual, the Transportation Department must ensure enough air traffic controllers are back at work to minimise staffing-related flight delays. FAA chief Michael Duffy then needs to lift the emergency order which reduced the flights.\n\nSeveral government-funded construction and infrastructure projects worth $11bn were suspended during the shutdown and it is unclear how and when progress will resume. These include work on two federally owned aging bridges across the Cape Cod canal in Massachusetts and a waterfront park in San Francisco.\n\n“It’s not just a question of ‘will they be resumed and when they resume’, it’s a question of whether that federal funding will be restored, and that’s not clear at this point,” Lucas said.\n\n“Federal funding might be restored for construction infrastructure projects, but what happens here is, is that you have to restart the pipeline for the funding. All of these things have had contracts. There will be contracts in terms of the timing of the delivery of funds, there will be, the congressional authorisation which is behind all that.”\n\nThe monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for October was not released, as it should normally have been, during the shutdown. Additionally, the release of key inflation data set for mid-October was postponed.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it is likely that these still won’t be released even if the shutdown ends because, she said, the shutdown prevented surveyors from going into the field to collect raw, time-sensitive data.\n\nLeavitt said that yet-to-be-collected data “will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period”.\n\nThis means policymakers in the Federal Reserve and other sectors have no access to key benchmark figures normally used to set interest rates and guide economic policy. Investors and businesses also do not have key data to make forecasts. In historical records, data from October 2025 will create a blind spot, distorting trend analysis in the future.\n\nWhile government funding has now been secured until the end of January, there is still no resolution on the issue of the ACA tax credits. If the standoff over healthcare is not resolved by the end of January, the US could therefore face another possible shutdown.\n\n“Now they have said that they will schedule a vote in the Senate on this in mid December, but of course scheduling a vote to extend the tax credits doesn’t mean that the credits that the vote will succeed,” Lucas said.\n\n“So we will be back at the end of January to square one effectively,” he added.\n\n“We could definitely face another standoff in January – in fact, I think the chances are increased. If we do not have some arrangement in terms of keeping the premiums down for these tens of millions of Americans, the Democrats have now made that their headline issue. It’ll be the issue all the way into the 2026 elections.”\n\nJanuary will be the point at which the Trump administration will need to request approval from Congress for another extension of government funding, and will need the support of Democrats again.\n\nLucas said that in the meantime, Americans relying on the ACA and other health insurance programmes will see their insurance premiums more than double between November and the end of January without the tax credits. He said this will increase healthcare costs, meaning “they’ll either have to bear by cutting elsewhere, or they’ll have to go without insurance, which has obvious consequences”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/zelenskyy-meets-troops-on-front-line-as-russia-ukraine-battle-in-key-areas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:24:01+00:00","title":"Zelenskyy meets troops on front line as Russia, Ukraine battle in key areas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the front lines near Orikhiv in the Zaporizhia region to boost troop morale, meeting with soldiers of the 65th Separate Mechanized Brigade and announcing military actions against Russian-occupied oil facilities in Crimea and Zaporizhia.

Another person was injured, he said.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence said on Thursday its units “continued their advance deep into the enemy’s defence” and took control of the village of Danylivka in the Dnipropetrovsk region. It said troops also took control of the settlement of Synelnykove in Kharkiv.\n\nEarlier this week, Russian forces captured three villages in the southern region, partially occupied by Moscow, with the fighting largely frozen.\n\nKyiv will “sooner or later” have to return to negotiations with Moscow and from a “much worse position”, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday, a day after Ukraine announced suspending peace talks to end the war that has continued since 2022.\n\nPeskov, responding to comments from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the situation for Kyiv is “deteriorating day by day”, asserting that Ukraine would eventually be compelled to re-engage in dialogue with Russia.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, in remarks published on Wednesday, told British daily The Times that Kyiv has formally halted the peace talks, citing a lack of meaningful progress during the rounds held earlier this year in Istanbul.\n\n“Since the peace talks ended this year without significant progress, they have been suspended,” Kyslytsya said, adding that Ukraine has asked allies to help secure a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Putin has shown no interest in such a summit, rebuffing entreaties from United States President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Friedrich Merz told Zelenskyy on Thursday that Germany expects Ukraine to do far more to fight corruption after reports of a  scandal  rocked Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government must “energetically advance anticorruption measures and further reforms, particularly in the area of the rule of law”, Merz told Zelenskyy in a phone call, a statement from the chancellery in Berlin said.\n\nZelenskyy on Thursday ordered sanctions on an associate and former business partner at the heart of the corruption scandal that has led to outrage in a nation exhausted by nearly four years of war.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine’s justice and energy ministers  submitted their resignations  amid the wide-reaching inquiry, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said, shortly after Zelenskyy called for their dismissals.\n\nAnticorruption officers have said the scheme saw $100m in funds from the energy sector – battered by Moscow’s attacks – siphoned off.\n\nIn the phone call, Zelenskyy told Merz about the investigations into the scandal and “promised complete transparency, long-term support for independent anticorruption authorities, as well as further swift measures to restore the trust of the Ukrainian population, European partners and international donors”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/gaza-woman-blinded-in-israeli-strike-opens-bakery-to-subsist-and-hope","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:29:20+00:00","title":"Gaza woman blinded in Israeli strike opens bakery to subsist and hope","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warda Abu Jarad, a 51-year-old Palestinian woman in Gaza, lost her vision in an Israeli airstrike that destroyed her home and caused debris to enter her eyes.

Palestinians who have been wounded in  Gaza  since Israel began its genocidal war on the territory in October 2023.\n\nAbu Jarad explained that she lost her sight when her house was bombed by the Israeli military, causing debris to fall into her eyes.\n\n“The smoke from the bombing blinded me completely,” she said.\n\nSpeaking from a tent in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, the mother told Al Jazeera that she was still adjusting to being blind and needs someone to guide her whenever she wants to move from one place to another.\n\n“Even when I want to move inside the tent, I wait for someone to help me cross,” she said. “I tried to enter the tent once, hit my head and fell, … so now I feel the ground with my feet to know what’s in front of me.”\n\nHer daughter has been her biggest

I opened a bakery and started to grow it. I started baking ma’amoul [filled butter cookies] and bread,” she said one month into a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“I need to keep going because the situation here is so hard,” she added.\n\nSince the ceasefire came into effect on October 10, there have been some small improvements in daily life in Gaza, but the United Nations and NGOs have warned that the amount of aid Israel is letting into Gaza remains wholly insufficient.\n\nIsrael claims it has adhered to the truce by permitting entry to 600 aid trucks each day while Hamas says the daily number is actually about 150.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said it had reopened  the Zikim crossing  to the northern Gaza Strip.\n\n“The opening of direct crossings to the north is vital to ensure that sufficient aid reaches people as soon as possible,” the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said recently.\n\n“All I want in life is to have my sight restored, and I want to see my daughter as a bride in her wedding dress.

whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-05-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-12:00","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm watch by the U.S. weather agency, Amazon’s recent layoffs, false claims by former President Trump about Tylenol and autism, and nuclear weapons accusations against Russia, China, and Pakistan.

billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/new-epstein-emails-and-files-what-do-they-reveal-about-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:23:00+00:00","title":"New Epstein emails and files: What do they reveal about Trump?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The release of over 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate by the US House Oversight Committee has reignited controversy over Donald Trump’s relationship with Epstein.

sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has once again come under scrutiny, after United States lawmakers  released  more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate on Wednesday, including some that mention Trump’s name.\n\nUS Democrats in the House Oversight Committee – a federal body that oversees government functions – released email exchanges between Epstein and some of his associates in which the former financier appeared to suggest that Trump knew about his conduct towards young girls.\n\nHours later, US Republicans released 20,000 documents from Epstein’s estate in a bid to counter the Democrats’ email releases, claiming the Democrats had “cherry-picked” documents to paint a false narrative against Trump. The Republicans’ documents also mention Trump’s name, but these references are mainly in regards to the US president’s political career.\n\nTrump, who had a 15-year-long friendship with Epstein, denies all wrongdoing and has repeatedly stated that he was never involved in – or even knew about – Epstein’s sexual crimes.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in prison in 2019 after being arrested on charges of sex trafficking of minors. He had previously been imprisoned in 2008 after pleading guilty at a court in Florida to engaging in prostitution of minors, but was released from prison in 2009 after completing his sentence.\n\nWhile some documents relating to the prosecution of Epstein  have been made public , the US Justice Department has repeatedly refused to release others, raising eyebrows – not least among  Trump’s own “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) base .\n\nIn June 2025, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk claimed on his social media platform X that “Trump is in the Epstein files” and said that was “the real reason they [the files] have not been made public”. But the Justice Department has said the real reason for not releasing the files is to protect the privacy of the victims.\n\nNext week, the US House of Representatives  will vote  on releasing all remaining sealed court files pertaining to Epstein.\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAt least three emails were made public by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\n\nEpstein and Maxwell:  One email is an April 2011 exchange between Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 and is currently serving a  20-year prison sentence . In the email, Epstein told her that Trump had “spent hours” at his house with one victim.\n\nEpstein wrote: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump. [redacted name of victim] spent hours at my house with him .. he has never once been mentioned.”\n\nMaxwell responded, “I have been thinking about that…”\n\nThe name of the victim was not released by the Democrats, but in the cache of  documents  released on Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee, the name is shown as  Virginia Giuffre , who sued disgraced Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (formerly Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom, before he was stripped of his royal titles last month) for rape and sexual assault before she died by suicide in April this year.\n\nIn a  statement  sent to US media on Wednesday, the White House also confirmed that the victim was Giuffre.\n\n“The ‘unnamed victim’ referenced in these emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and ‘couldn’t have been friendlier’ to her in their limited interactions,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n“The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,” she added.\n\nEpstein and Wolff:  Epstein and US journalist Michael Wolff, who has written four books about Trump, also exchanged emails that included details of their strategising against Trump, according to the documents released by the Democrats.\n\nIn December 2015, seven years after Epstein had pleaded guilty to his crimes – which included engaging in prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 – Wolff wrote to Epstein: “I hear CNN is planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you – either on air or in scrum afterwards.”\n\nEpstein replied: “If we were to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?”\n\nWolff responded: “I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.”\n\nIn a separate email in October 2016, Wolff tried to persuade Epstein to give an interview, writing: “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?” The email was written just before Trump’s presidential election win in November 2016. It is not clear if Epstein responded.\n\nIn another email in 2019, Epstein wrote to Wolff that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop”, referring to Maxwell.\n\nResponding to the emails released by the Democrats on Wednesday, Wolff told the Daily Beast podcast Inside Trump’s Head late on Wednesday that he was “nice” to Epstein to try to understand him better and get “an entirely different view” of Trump.\n\nWolff’s books about Trump include the 2018 bestseller Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which revealed backstories of discord within his administration during his first term as president.\n\n“I’m the person who sees this, this elemental story, Donald Trump,” Wolff told The Daily Beast. “I’ve gone through this with Epstein deep into the background. Donald Trump is the best friend of, you know, evil. He is the best friend of a deeply, deeply diabolical person.”\n\nWolff said that he also hoped to persuade Epstein to come forward and speak up about what he knew about Trump. “‘Why don’t you go public with these pictures? Why don’t you go public? Let me help you go public in telling your story about Donald Trump’,” Wolff claimed he told Epstein.\n\nBut he said he believed Epstein was afraid of Trump. “Epstein was fearful about what would happen to him if Donald Trump became the president of the United States,” Wolff told the Daily Beast.\n\nThe author added that the reason he was trying to convince Epstein to come forward was because he “saw then” and continues to “see and see every day now, that Donald Trump was unfit to be the president of the United States”.\n\nSeparately, on October 23 this year, the author claimed in a lawsuit he filed at the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan against First Lady Melania Trump that she had threatened to sue him for more than $1bn if he didn’t retract his statements linking Epstein to her.\n\nWolff had claimed that Melania Trump was “very involved” in Epstein’s social circle, through which she met her future husband, Donald Trump.\n\nWolff added that the president and his wife “have made a practice of threatening those who speak against them”.\n\nTrump immediately dismissed the emails as a “hoax” in a social media post.\n\n“The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTrump’s press secretary Leavitt also told journalists at the White House on Wednesday that “these emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong”.\n\nUS Democrat Ro Khanna, however, told the Breaking Points podcast that “this whole Epstein class needs to go”.\n\n“The issue in American politics from left or right is: Are you for working, ordinary Americans? Or are you for this Epstein class? And this is what’s so important about those emails. It’s not just rich and powerful men who may have abused and raped young girls; it’s a lot of rich and powerful people who knew that the abuse was going on and did nothing about it.”\n\nThe email release also took place on the day that Democratic Representative Adelita Grijalva was sworn in by House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n“It’s past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration,” Grijalva told local media.\n\nTrump has warned members of the Republican Party against focusing attention on the Democrats’ emails.\n\n“There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!” Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\nUS Republican members of the House Oversight Committee, however, responded to the release of the emails with the release of around 20,000 Epstein-related documents obtained from his estate, just hours later.\n\nThese documents reveal email exchanges between Epstein and his associates in which they discuss Trump’s presidential career and his whereabouts.\n\nIn one email from December 2018 to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H Summers, Epstein called Trump “borderline insane” and then spoke about lawyer Alan Dershowitz, his defence attorney at the time. “dersh, a few feet further from the border but not by much”. It is unclear what these comments are related to.\n\nSummers replied: “Will trump crack into insanity?”\n\nEpstein responded: “This is not a new phenomenon for him. in the past he was told not to come out of his apt. thats how he got through near personal bankruptcy. is strength is remarkable. he is pounded 24/7.”\n\n“I hope someone close to him gets indicted, but not sure, otherwise the pressure of the unknown will force him to do crazy things,” he added.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told reporters in Washington, DC on Wednesday: “These emails prove literally nothing.”\n\nBut some Republicans want the US government to release all existing Epstein files, once and for all.\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, told US broadcaster MSNBC on Wednesday that he’d vote in favour of a bill demanding Trump’s Justice Department release all the files.\n\nReferring to the release of the documents by the House Oversight Committee, he said: “It’s still got to work its way through the Senate and the president. But we’re already getting a lot of results.”\n\nAccording to reports from Axios and other US media, Trump and other administration officials have reached out to some Republican representatives such as Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace to try to persuade them to remove their names from a petition that would force a vote in the House on releasing all of the Epstein files.\n\nBut Boebert told reporters on Wednesday in DC that there was “no pressure” and said she remained a supporter of the petition.\n\nIn a post on X, she wrote that “the Epstein petition is deeply personal”, as she is also a “survivor of sexual and domestic violence”.\n\n“I signed the discharge petition. I was one of four Republicans to do so. I stand with all survivors,” she wrote.\n\n“When it seems like the world is against you. When the press hates your guts. When your friends desert you. Your pain is my pain. Your fight is my fight. Your justice is our justice.”\n\nThe Epstein petition is deeply personal. When I was 14 I was molested by a friend of one of my coaches and sexually assaulted at 16. I was violently mugged months later. I dropped out of high school at 17 because I had nothing left to give. But God helped me turn things around.…\n\n— Rep. Nancy Mace (@RepNancyMace)  November 12, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett told reporters on Wednesday that he was “tired of messing around” with the issue.\n\n“The Democrats have had the Epstein files for four years, and now we’ve got it for nine months, and it’s going to be dragged into a bunch of nonsense. Let’s just take it to the floor. Let’s vote on it. Let’s get on with it,” he said.\n\nThe release of the House Oversight Committee’s documents on Wednesday came as the House voted to end its 43-day-long shutdown of the federal government, which began on October 1 this year.\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that he will hold a vote next week to decide if all Epstein files should be released.\n\nJohnson added that he wanted to “remind everybody” that the GOP-led House Oversight Committee had been “working around the clock” on its own investigation into the case.\n\nEven if the House votes in favour of the bill, the Senate will have to agree, and Trump will have to sign the bill ordering the files to be released. US presidents do have the power of veto, and can reject bills. However, they are required to give a reason for the rejection. The bill would then be sent back to the House to vote on again.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House’s Leavitt defended the Trump administration and said it has “done more with respect to transparency when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein than any administration ever”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the controversy surrounding claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that the United States would resume nuclear weapons testing.

will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to enter our solar system, after it passed near Mars in October 2025 and is expected to reach its closest point to Earth in December 2025.

to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center suggests that mRNA vaccines used to prevent COVID-19 could enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and attack cancer cells, particularly in previously hard-to-treat 'cold' tumors.

University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known locally as Super Typhoon Uwan, devastated northern Philippines after a week of recovery from Typhoon Kalmaegi, resulting in at least 10 deaths and over 1.4 million people displaced.

with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.\n\nThe message sent by Epstein - who is alleged to have taken the photo - reads: \"Yes she [Giuffre] was on my plane and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew.\"\n\nEpstein's account appears to contradict the former prince's assertion that he never met Ms Giuffre and his longstanding suggestion that the image of him with his arm around her may have been doctored.\n\nThe July 2011 email was published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of correspondence from the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier's estate.\n\nMs Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein -  alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager .\n\nAndrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.\n\nThe email from Epstein to his publicist Peggy Siegal was sent shortly after Ms Giuffre was identified publicly in the Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe newspaper also printed the photo of her with Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew denied meeting Ms Giuffre and   suggested that the photograph - or elements of it - may have been faked.\n\nAndrew said at the time: \"Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken.\"\n\nThe documents - published by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee - also suggest that Andrew and Epstein remained in contact four months after the prince claimed their relationship had ended.\n\nOn 4 March 2011, Maxwell appears to have forwarded a right-of-reply email from the Mail on Sunday to Epstein.\n\nIt outlines a series of allegations, including that Andrew had sex with a young woman introduced to him at Maxwell's London home in 2001.\n\nThe message appears to have then been forwarded by Epstein to Andrew, via redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".\n\nAndrew's reply reads: \"Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can't take any more of this my end.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday went on to publish its story alongside the photograph.\n\nIt included allegations that girls were directed to sit on Andrew's knee at Epstein's New York home, that he groped them and took part in sexual encounters on Epstein's private island.\n\nThe documents also reveal attempts by Epstein to discredit Ms Giuffre's testimony.\n\nIn the July 2011 email to his publicist, Epstein also wrote: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think Buckingham Palace would love it.\n\n\"You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro [sic].\"\n\nThe latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in the US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.\n\nA Democrat on the House Oversight Committee - Congressman Suhas Subramanyam - told BBC Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee.\n\nHe said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\".\n\nAndrew  was stripped of all his titles  earlier this month after Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir renewed interest in his ties to Epstein and Maxwell."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rj0d97ynvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:27:26.799+00:00","title":"What we know about the latest Epstein emails referencing Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US lawmakers have released over 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including emails that reference President Donald Trump, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew.

They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".\n\nThe emails were obtained by the committee after it subpoenaed Epstein's estate as part of its own probe into the federal investigation of Epstein.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\n\n\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\".\n\nEpstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".\n\nMaxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"\n\nThe victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\".\n\nThe White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre,  a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year . In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".\n\nGiuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse.  And in a memoir released this year , she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.\n\nAsked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.\n\nIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who   - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office.\n\nIn a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".\n\nEpstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nWolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\n\"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.\n\nA third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.\n\nIn it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\".\n\nEpstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\".\n\nResponding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nAs well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.\n\nHe responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.\n\nAndrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"\n\nMaxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.\n\nThe right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.\n\nOn 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.\n\nLord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.\n\nThey show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016 , according to the documents.\n\nThe latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAn email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".\n\nLord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".\n\nEpstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.\n\nEpstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.\n\nLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.\n\nAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released.\n\nIn it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"\n\nFarmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpkerdn9qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:52:18.448+00:00","title":"Germany paves way to conscription as defence boss sees strongest EU army in five years","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany is implementing a new military service plan to strengthen its armed forces, mandating 18-year-old men to complete a suitability questionnaire and, from 2027, undergo mandatory medical screening.

paves way to conscription as defence boss sees strongest EU army in five years\n\nGermany's coalition government has agreed a new military service plan to boost troop numbers following months of wrangling between political forces.\n\nThe new military service plan will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their suitability to serve and, from 2027, to undergo medical screening.\n\nThe decision comes as Berlin aims to create Europe's strongest conventional army.\n\nThe boss of Germany's biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, has told the BBC he believes that target could be met in five years.\n\nArmin Papperger said Chancellor Friedrich Merz's aim to boost the Bundeswehr was \"realistic\" and he told the BBC that \"clear decisions\" were coming from government.\n\nEarlier this year German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer warned that the Western Nato alliance had to prepare for a possible Russian attack within four years.\n\nMr Papperger said he had \"no glass ball\" about the future but agreed Germany had to be \"ready in '29\".\n\nWhen they formed a coalition earlier this year, Merz's conservative CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrat SPD agreed to re-introduce military service which would be voluntary \"to start with\".\n\nThe Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops. The new military service model aims to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year, rising to between 255,000 and 260,000 over the next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists.\n\nFrom next year, all 18-year-old men and women will be sent a questionnaire to assess their interest and willingness to join the armed forces. It will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.\n\nFrom July 2027 all men aged 18 will also have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for duty.\n\nIf the government's targets are not met, a form of compulsory enlistment could be considered by parliament. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.\n\nSome within Germany's political left remain deeply opposed to mandatory service.\n\nMany young Germans are wary and a significant majority oppose it. A recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine suggested while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds.\n\n\"I don't want to go to war because I don't want to die or I don't want to be shot at,\" said Jimi, a 17-year-old student from Berlin, who attended an anti-conscription protest outside the Bundestag earlier this week. \"I also don't want to shoot people.\"\n\nAn attack against Germany was an \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" that the government was using to legitimise \"stealing millions of young people's right to decide what they should be doing\", he said.\n\nMeanwhile, 21-year-old Jason signed up as new Bundeswehr recruit earlier this year because of the current \"security situation\".\n\n\"I wanted to contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if the worst happens,\" he said. By joining up he felt he was \"giving back to society\" but also believed in the deterrent potential of the army, \"so potential enemies don't even think about attacking you\".\n\nDefence Minister Boris Pistorius has sought to reassure Germans, saying that despite the new military service plan there was \"no cause for concern... no reason for fear\".\n\n\"The more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces are, through armament through training and through personnel, the less likely it is that we will become a party to a conflict at all,\" Pistorius said.\n\nDefence spending in Germany tumbled after the end of the Cold War, while conscription was suspended in 2011.\n\nGiven its past, Germany has long been shy of showing military might, but earlier this year Friedrich Merz announced that the rule for German defence \"now has to be whatever it takes\", following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNato countries across Europe have come under pressure from President Donald Trump's White House to hike spending.\n\nEuropean moves to re-arm have meant significant revenue for Rheinmetall.\n\nIts CEO, Armin Papperger, whose firm also supplies Ukraine, said: \"We make a lot of money because there is a huge demand.\"\n\n\"We have to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we have to have our own satellite competencies. We do much more on the electronics and artificial intelligence... than ever before,\" he said.\n\nA US report last year suggested the Rheinmetall boss had been the target of a Russian assassination plot. There was no confirmation at the time and Mr Papperger would not be drawn on the report, saying: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\"\n\nAsked about whether he felt Europe was in a state of a cold or hybrid war, he said: \"Whatever you call it, it's not a peaceful time.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62012e6g9lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:17:46.188+00:00","title":"Deadly Rio police raid failed to loosen gang's iron grip, residents say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive police raid on 28 October 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, involving 2,500 officers and resulting in 121 deaths including four police officers, was aimed at dismantling the Comando Vermelho (CV) gang, which controls key favelas like Alemão and Penha.

2025-11-13T17:17:46.188+00:00\n\nTitle: Deadly Rio police raid failed to loosen gang's iron grip, residents say\n\nNew details which have emerged in the aftermath of Brazil's deadliest police operation are casting doubts over whether the raid really struck at the heart of one of the country's most powerful criminal gangs, as was its stated aim.\n\nOne hundred and twenty one people, among them four police officers, were killed in the raid on 28 October in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Claudio Castro, described the police operation as \"a success\", posting a photo showing the more than 100 rifles seized by police.\n\nBut rights groups have sharply criticised the security forces pointing to the high death toll and what they have described as the \"brutality\" of their actions.\n\nThe operation was the largest ever carried out by Rio's security forces and saw 2,500 officers deployed to the Alemão and Penha neighbourhoods.\n\nIt targeted the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) criminal gang, which rules over the nine-million-square-metre area.\n\nRio's public safety secretary, Victor dos Santos, told Reuters that the goal of the operation had been to carry out scores of arrest warrants issued by prosecutors.\n\nBut when BBC Brasil cross-checked the list of the deceased published by police against the 68 names on the list of suspects provided by prosecutors, it found that none of them matched.\n\nLocal media have also pointed out that even though scores of suspects were arrested during the raid, the man considered the gang's most powerful leader, Edgar Alves de Andrade, also known as Doca, was not among them.\n\n\"Early reports stated that the goal of the operation was to capture high-ranking leaders of the Comando Vermelho (CV),\" Carlos Schmidt-Padilla, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, told BBC Brasil.\n\n\"By that metric, it is fair to say the operation failed.\"\n\nAt a Senate hearing, the deputy intelligence secretary for Rio's military police  stated that the raid had had a \"negligible\" impact on dismantling Comando Vermelho.\n\nResidents of the Alemão and Penha have also told the BBC that it has done little to loosen the tight grip the CV has on their favelas.\n\nThey said that their daily lives had barely changed since the mega-operation, describing seeing armed men roaming the community the very next day, even as the bodies of those killed were still being removed.\n\nComando Vermelho (CV) and groups like it enforce strict rules in the areas they control.\n\nThese criminal enterprises have moved beyond the sale of drugs and now hold the monopoly for the provision of gas, cable television, internet and transport.\n\nResidents report being charged over the odds for gas cylinders, often having to pay one third more than in zones not under gang control.\n\nRules imposed by gang members affect everyday life.\n\nAs CV has banned cars working for ride-hailing apps from entering the favelas, locals are restricted to using motorbike taxis and vans which have been authorised by the gangs to operate there.\n\nEven people's clothing is policed by the gang. In 2020, residents of Penha were told not to wear Chelsea football shirts.\n\nAt the time, the jerseys were sponsored by British telecoms company Three, but CV members did not like the number being prominently displayed because it reminded them of a rival gang which happened to have the number three in its name: Terceiro Comando Puro (Pure Third Command).\n\nPunishments for what are considered transgressions are extremely harsh. Being caught stealing can mean losing a hand or being burned alive.\n\nGang members \"sit in judgement\" over domestic violence cases and those found guilty are beaten or even executed.\n\nResidents are forbidden from engaging in relationships with members of rival factions or with police officers.\n\nThey also know not to photograph or film drug dens or any of the armed men driving through their community.\n\nBut with mobile phone use ubiquitous, even gangs as powerful as Comando Vermelho struggle to control what gets posted online.\n\nIn Rocinha, a favela under CV control, gang members vowed to kill those who leaked a 2020 video showing a CV leader surrounded by rifles and machine guns.\n\nWhen someone insists on \"causing trouble\", the group often resorts to assault and torture.\n\nPolice investigation files on Comando Vermelho, seen by the BBC, contain disturbing images.\n\nOne shows a woman forcibly submerged in an ice bath, accompanied by a caption accusing her of being \"aggressive\" and \"causing trouble\".\n\nReports of growing violence and expanding territorial control by Comando Vermelho formed the basis of the complaint filed by Rio's Public Prosecutor's Office which led to the massive police operation on 28 October.\n\nAnd while rights groups labelled it a \"massacre\" and questioned its effectiveness, Rio de Janeiro State Governor Claudio Castro has announced that more operations against organised crime will follow.\n\nA poll conducted by AtlasIntel suggests that Castro's approval rating has risen since the raid, and at 47% now stands higher than that of the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nPresident Lula, for his part, has announced that the federal government would launch an investigation into the raid.\n\nBut in a post on Instagram published on 11 November, Governor Castro said he would \"not back down\".\n\n\"Law-abiding citizens can't take it anymore.

PlayStation with new console\n\nValve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nThe Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.\n\nIt is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.\n\nPrices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.\n\nThe Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.\n\nThe company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.\n\nSince Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.\n\nAround 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.\n\nBut whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year.\n\nAnalysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched  in its original, clunkier form a decade ago  - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam \"power users\".\n\nIn a video announcement, Valve described the new console as \"a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package\".\n\nThe firm argues the device is \"optimised for gaming\" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.\n\nPowered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.\n\nBut industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a \"lucrative but niche\" audience of \"around four to five million players\".\n\n\"Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,\" he said.\n\n\"My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting.\".\n\nIn an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.\n\nThe device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a \"streaming-first\" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.\n\nAnd it also claims to be bringing   a technical leap forward in the VR space, with the headset displaying highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen a user is looks at.\n\nWith the sweeping new device announcements, Valve hopes to rival its more established competitors.\n\nIn recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.\n\nMeanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking  when its successor will appear on the market .\n\nBrandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's \"strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want\".\n\n\"With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,\" he told the BBC.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

the rhythm of the morning commute slows down for the students.\n\nBy late afternoon, most test-takers walk out of school gates, exhaling with relief and embracing the family members waiting outside.\n\nBut not everyone finishes at that hour.

It is the highest number of applicants in seven years.\n\nThe test not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can affect their job prospects, income, where they will live and even future relationships.\n\nDepending on their subject choices, students answer roughly 200 questions across Korean, mathematics, English, social or natural sciences, an additional foreign language, and Hanja (classical Chinese characters used in Korean).\n\nFor most students, it is an eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams. They begin the Suneung test at 08:40 and finish around 17:40.\n\nBlind students with severe visual impairments, however, are given 1.7 times the standard testing duration.\n\nThis means that if they take the additional foreign language section, the exam can finish as late as 21:48 - nearly 13 hours after it began.\n\nThere is no dinner break; the exam continues straight through.\n\nThe physical bulk of the braille test papers also contributes to the length.\n\nWhen every sentence, symbol and diagram is converted into braille, each test booklet becomes six to nine times thicker than the standard equivalent.\n\nAt Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Han Donghyun is among the students who will take the longest version of the Suneung this year.\n\nLast year, there were 111 blind test-takers nationwide - 99 with low vision and 12 with severe visual impairments like Dong-hyun - according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation.\n\nDong-hyun was born completely blind and cannot distinguish light.\n\nWhen the BBC met him at his school on 7 November, his fingers moved quickly across a braille practice booklet of past exam questions.\n\nWith just a week left before the test, he was focused on managing his stamina and condition. Dong-hyun will take the exam using braille test papers and a screen-reading computer.\n\n\"It's really exhausting because the exam is so long,\" he said. \"But there's no special trick. I just follow my study schedule and try to manage my condition. That's the only way.\"\n\nDong-hyun said the Korean language section is particularly difficult for him.\n\nA standard test booklet for that section is about 16 pages - but the braille version is roughly 100 pages long.\n\nEven with screen-reading software, spoken information disappears as soon as it is heard, unlike text that can be seen and re-read. Dong-hyun has to hold the details in his memory as he goes.\n\nThe mathematics section is no easier.\n\nHe must interpret complex graphs and tables that have been converted into braille, using only his fingertips.\n\nStill, he noted that things are better than they used to be. In the past, students had to do almost all calculations in their heads. But since 2016, blind test-takers have been allowed to use a braille notetaker, known as Hansone.\n\n\"Just like sighted students write out their calculations in pencil, we enter them in braille on the Hansone to follow the steps,\" he said.\n\nAnother student at Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Oh Jeong-won, who will also sit the Suneung this year, said the late afternoon is \"the hardest point\" of the day.\n\n\"Up until lunch, it's manageable,\" he said. \"But around 4 or 5pm, after English and before Korean History, that's when it gets really tough.\n\n\"There's no dinner break,\" he explained. \"We're solving problems during the time we would normally eat, so it feels even more exhausting. Still, I keep going because I know there will be a sense of accomplishment at the end.\"\n\nFor Jeong-won, the fatigue is compounded by the need to stay intensely focused with both his hands and his hearing.\n\n\"When I'm reading the braille with my fingers and also taking in information through audio, it feels much more tiring than it does for sighted students,\" he said.\n\nBut the students say that the length of the exam and the long study hours are not the hardest part. What is most challenging is access to study materials.\n\nPopular textbooks and online lectures that sighted students rely on are often out of reach.\n\nThere are very few braille versions, and converting materials into audio requires having text files - which are difficult to obtain. In many cases, someone has to manually type out entire workbooks to make them usable.\n\nOnline lectures also pose difficulties, as many instructors explain concepts using visual notes, diagrams and graphics on screen, which cannot be followed through audio alone.\n\nOne of the most significant barriers, however, is the delay in receiving braille versions of the state-produced EBS preparation books - a core set of materials closely linked to the national exam.\n\nBecause of this delay, blind students often receive the materials months later than others.\n\n\"Sighted students get their EBS books between January and March and study them for the whole year,\" said Jeong-won. \"We receive the braille files only around August or September, when the exam is just a few months away.\"\n\nDong-hyun shared the same concern.\n\n\"The braille materials weren't completed until less than 90 days before the exam,\" he said. \"I kept wishing the publication process could be faster.\"\n\nThe National Institute of Special Education, which produces the braille version of EBS exam materials, told the BBC that the process takes at least three months for each book because it must follow relevant guidelines.\n\nThe institute added that it is \"making various efforts to ensure that blind students can study without disruption, such as producing and providing the materials in separate volumes.\"\n\nThe Korean Blind Union said it has long raised this issue with authorities, and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding greater accessibility to braille versions of all textbooks.\n\nFor these students, the Suneung is not just a college entrance exam - it's proof of the years they have endured to get where they are.\n\nJeong-won described the exam as \"perseverance.\"\n\n\"There's almost nothing you can do in life without perseverance,\" he said. \"I think this time is a process of training my will.\"\n\nTheir teacher, Kang Seok-ju, watches students go through the exam every year - and said the blind students' endurance is \"remarkable\".\n\n\"Reading braille means tracing raised dots with your fingertips. The constant friction can make their hands quite sore,\" he pointed out. \"But they do it for hours.\"\n\nMr Kang urged his students to value completion rather than regret.\n\n\"This exam is where you pour everything you've learned since the first grade into a single day,\" he said. \"Many students feel disappointed afterwards, but I just want them to leave knowing they did what they could.\n\n\"The exam is not everything.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories.

“elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6291204278o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:24:54.546+00:00","title":"France remembers Bataclan attacks but knows enemy has not gone away","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On the 10th anniversary of the 2015 Bataclan massacre, which killed 130 people during a concert and remains a defining moment in French history, France faces renewed concerns over the enduring threat of jihadist terrorism.

the 10th anniversary of the Bataclan massacres, another reminder has come of the permanence of the jihadist threat.\n\nA former girlfriend of the only jihadist to survive the November 2015 attacks has been arrested on suspicion of plotting her own violent act.\n\nThe woman - a 27 year-old French convert to Islam named as Maëva B - began a letter-writing relationship with Salah Abdeslam, 36, who is serving a life sentence in jail near the Belgian border following his conviction in 2022.\n\nWhen prison guards discovered that Abdeslam had been using a USB key containing jihadist propaganda, they traced its origin to face-to-face meetings that the prisoner had with Maëva B.\n\nDetectives then looked into Maëva B's own computer and telephone, where they found evidence she may have been planning a jihadist attack, and on Monday she was placed under judicial investigation along with two alleged associates.\n\nWith France commemorating 10 years since the worst attack in its modern history,  the arrest has focused minds on the enemy that never went away.\n\nSix plots have been thwarted this year, says Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and the threat level remains high.\n\nOn the evening of 13 November 2015, jihadist gunmen and suicide bombers conducted a sequence of co-ordinated attacks that culminated in a bloody raid on the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris.\n\nBefore that, three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France where a football international was under way. Then others in the gang opened fire with Kalashnikovs on people drinking in bars and cafés not far from the Bataclan.\n\nThere,  a performance by American group The Eagles of Death Metal had just started, when three jihadists burst in and fired indiscriminately into the auditorium.  They took hostages and then blew themselves up as police moved in.\n\nOverall 130 people were killed, 90 in the Bataclan, and more than 400 treated in hospital. Countless others suffered psychological trauma.\n\nThe word Bataclan has since become a byword in France for extreme Islamist attacks, in much the same way that 9/11 did in the US.\n\nThough there have been other attacks since, like the Nice lorry massacre of July 2016 and the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020, the scale and organisation of 13 November 2015 set it apart.\n\nTen years on, much has changed. The disappearance of the Islamic State (IS) group as a major force in Syria and Iraq means that the wherewithal to conceive, plan and carry out complex terrorist projects is greatly diminished.\n\nThe Bataclan attackers were young men of mainly North African origin, recruited in Belgium and France, trained in IS territory in the Middle East, who then returned to Europe hidden among a vast flow of migrants.\n\nEverywhere they could draw on a network of supporters offering shelter, transport and cash.\n\nAccording to leading Middle East expert Gilles Kepel, intelligence services have also become highly effective in controlling online radicalisation.\n\n\"They now have access to IT resources… which allow them to detect a lot of individual initiatives, often not very sophisticated ones... and stop them before they hatch,\" he said in an interview with Le Figaro.\n\nBut according to Mr Kepel, the danger now comes from what he calls \"ambient jihadism\".\n\n\"The threat is now home-grown and a lot younger. It feeds on friendships and social networks of the like-minded, without there ever necessarily being people having to give and obey orders,\" he said.\n\nThe threat is all the more concerning, he believes, because it is so porous - with events in Gaza and Israel having a \"traumatic effect\" on the minds of many citizens and being \"exploited by the entrepreneurs of anger\".\n\nFrance's current political crisis is also stoking the danger, he argues, with an impotent presidency giving way to a partisan parliament where extremists of left and right hold increasing sway.\n\n\"If what separates us becomes more important than what unites us as French people and fractures the national consensus, then there will open a chasm beneath our feet and violence will have fewer and fewer restraints,\" he said.\n\nThursday's commemorations will be held throughout the day at the various attack sites, culminating with the opening of a 13 November garden near Paris City Hall.\n\nWhen night falls, the Eiffel Tower will be bathed in the red, white and blue of the French flag.\n\nFrench media have been full of accounts and memories, with survivors describing how their lives have changed.\n\nIn an unexpected development, Salah Abdeslam has let it be known through his lawyer that he would be prepared to co-operate in any effort at \"restorative justice\" - a procedure where victims and perpetrators meet to discuss the impact of a crime.\n\nThe idea has been mooted by some families - but others are vehemently opposed.\n\nAccording to Laurent Sourisseau, a cartoonist also known as Riss, who was shot and wounded in the Charlie Hebdo attack a few months before the Bataclan massacres, Abdeslam's offer is \"perverse\".\n\n\"Restorative justice exists for other types of crime - common crimes,\" he said.\n\n\"But terrorism is not a common crime. Salah Abdeslam wants to make us think his crime was like any other. But it was not.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93x5xw22n6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:47:59.826+00:00","title":"Slow growth raises stakes even higher for the Budget","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK economy has returned to slow growth, with a 0.1% increase in the July-to-September quarter below forecasts and a contraction in September due in part to a cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover.

the UK has returned to the slower lanes of growth, having outperformed earlier in the year.\n\nThe 0.1% growth  seen in the July-to-September quarter was below forecasts, and the economy shrank in the month of September.\n\nA breakdown in car production following the cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover does explain September's contraction, and why the overall growth figures were worse than expected.\n\nThe ONS told me that if vehicle production had been flat rather than the worst monthly fall on record outside of the pandemic, GDP in September would have gone up.\n\nThat is not the full story, though. Momentum in the economy has clearly flagged.\n\nIn particular, slowdowns in consumer-facing services and business investment are a key concern.\n\nHigher costs of employment and the constantly rolling uncertainty are not helping.\n\nConsumers remain cautious, with high savings rates, and businesses have not yet turned on the investment taps.\n\nA key objective for the Budget is to end the constant doom loop of speculation about tax changes. There will be a bigger buffer against fiscal shocks, and potential changes to how often the chancellor's borrowing rules are assessed.\n\nCertainty has a price, however, in terms of tax rises. The Budget will try to target the rise in tax away from worker pay packets and investors, but the sums involved make this a tricky task.\n\nThe silver lining for some to the cloudy figures is that a further Bank of England rate cut next month now seems very likely, with perhaps more to come next year.\n\nIt is reflected in the declining cost of government borrowing on markets, with key two- and five-year rates now below what Labour inherited when entering office. The cost of fixed mortgage rates is also starting to come down.\n\nThe chancellor will see this as vindication for a tough stance on her \"non-negotiable\" rules, and will use these figures to demand discipline over tricky Budget decisions from her backbenches. The property market has also, however, been impacted by speculation about tax changes.\n\nThe feel-good factor is missing. UK consumers, unlike US consumers, have kept savings levels high, and are not spending as much. Years of rolling crises, followed by ongoing uncertainty about policy, has left scars.\n\nThe UK economy has not managed to break the trend of slow growth, despite a strong-ish first half of the year. There was no growth when adjusting for the size of the population.\n\nWhile the economy has defied the recessionary vibes, and could still end up the second fastest G7 economy this year, the Budget somehow has to provide certainty, try to boost consumer and business confidence, and at the same time fill a large fiscal gap.\n\nIt's quite the ask, and the latest growth figures have raised the stakes for the Budget even higher."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5e9n3q8qdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:03:28.166+00:00","title":"Titanic passenger's pocket watch expected to fetch £1m at auction","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A gold pocket watch belonging to Isidor Straus, a wealthy American businessman and co-owner of Macy's, was recovered from the Titanic wreckage after the ship sank in 1912.

National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.\n\nAfter the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?\n\nSenate Democrats, through  their use of the parliamentary filibuster , were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.\n\nThey drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nWhen a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.\n\nSince then, members of the party's left flank have been furious.\n\nThey've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.\n\nEven more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\n\n\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"\n\nNewsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.\n\nIf he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.\n\nFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.\n\nOn Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\n\n\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"\n\nTrump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\n\n\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.\n\nAlthough there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.\n\nWhile his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.\n\nWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.\n\nWhile several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.\n\nDemocrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.\n\nAnd that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on  the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .\n\nLater on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.\n\nIt was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\n\n\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.\n\nIt was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

in their latest bid to pressure the coffee chain for better pay and staffing after negotiations stalled.\n\nThe union, Starbucks Workers United, is also pushing the company to resolve hundreds of unfair labour practice charges.\n\nTalks for a contract agreement broke down in the spring, and the two sides remain at odds over key economic issues.\n\nStarbucks said the strike on Thursday will affect fewer than 1% of its thousands of shops, adding service will continue as usual at the \"vast majority\" of stores.\n\nThe union, which launched four years ago, said it had won elections at more than 600 stores - roughly 5% of the chain's company-owned US locations.\n\nMore than 1,000 union baristas in over 40 cities are participating in the unfair labour practice strike, the union said. The action was timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup Day, a major holiday sales event.\n\nThe strike could expand to more locations if the two sides fail to reach an agreement, the union said.\n\n\"We're risking a lot,\" Dachi Spoltore, a striking barista from Pittsburgh, said on a call with reporters on Thursday. \"Jobs, our livelihoods, our economic security - this might be a game to Starbucks, but this isn't a game for us.\"\n\n\"We'll be calling on all Starbucks customers who care about this company treating us fairly to pledge: no contract and no coffee.\"\n\nThe walkout is limited to a fraction of Starbucks' US locations, but it could  invite unwanted scrutiny  at a delicate time for the company.\n\nThe brand has faced consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks.\n\nThe arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, who led successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks.\n\nMr Niccol quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. His new policies have included banning non-customers from bathrooms, enforcing a stricter dress code for staff and re-introducing comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal.\n\nAt the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training.\n\nLast month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat.\n\n\"We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,\" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts.\n\nBaristas and their union say many of the new turnaround policies, like writing on cups and offering ceramic mugs, have only added to their workload, without an adequate increase in staffing.\n\nRami Saied, a union barista who has worked at Starbucks for two years, joined a picket line in front of her coffee shop in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday morning. As customers approached the store, she and her colleagues asked them to support the workers by buying their coffee elsewhere.\n\nA fair contract, she said, would mean Starbucks negotiating over wages, scheduling and staffing.\n\n\"To me, the staffing really matters,\" said Ms Saied, 27. She said she has worked hours-long shifts with just one other employee, resulting in 30-minute delays for drink orders.\n\n\"You're just really working back-breaking work. It just leaves you without any dignity,\" she said.\n\nKaari Harsila, 21, walked off her job as a shift supervisor at the Brooklyn store. Four years into her time at Starbucks, she said she has grown frustrated that she is unable to secure the hours she needs.\n\nNew policies, like refusing to give water and bathroom access to non-paying customers, have at times fuelled hostility in the workplace, she added.\n\n\"We just want to be able to make a liveable wage, and to be treated like people,\" Ms Harsila said.\n\nStarbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September.\n\nEven after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practices.\n\nA union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April.\n\nThe company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would \"significantly affect store operations and customer experience\", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week.\n\n\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement.\n\n\"Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,\" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly45dqpwywo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:03:27.157+00:00","title":"Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims hits $5bn valuation","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Skims, the shapewear and athleisure brand co-founded by Kim Kardashian, has achieved a $5bn valuation after raising $225 million in new funding, including investment from Goldman Sachs.

policy that mandated the use of indigenous languages for teaching in the earliest years of schooling instead of English.\n\nEducation Minister Tunji Alausa said the programme, introduced just three years ago, had failed to deliver and was being scrapped with immediate effect.\n\nInstead, English will be reinstated as the medium of instruction from pre-primary levels through to university.\n\nThe now-defunct programme was launched by former Education Minister Adamu Adamu, who had argued that children learnt more effectively in their mother tongue.\n\nAt the time, Adamu argued that pupils grasped concepts more readily when taught in \"their own mother tongue\" - a view supported by numerous UN studies on early childhood education.\n\nNigeria's education system is facing serious problems, such as poor-quality teaching, inadequate materials, low pay for teachers and numerous strikes.\n\nAlthough 85% of children go to primary school, less than half complete their secondary education.\n\nSome 10 million children are out of school in Nigeria, more than in any other country, according to the UN.\n\nAnnouncing the reversal of the language policy in the capital, Abuja, Dr Alausa pointed to poor academic results from those areas which had adopted mother-tongue teaching.\n\nHe cited data from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the National Examinations Council (Neco), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).\n\n\"We have seen a mass failure rate in WAEC, Neco, and Jamb in certain geo-political zones of the country, and those are the ones that adopted this mother tongue in an over-subscribed manner,\" the minister stated.\n\nThe abrupt cancellation of the policy has drawn a mixed response from education specialists, analysts and parents.\n\nSome have hailed the government's decision, agreeing that the implementation was problematic and contributed to falling standards.\n\nOthers, however, believe the policy was abandoned prematurely. They argue that such a significant shift requires substantial investment in teacher training, the development of textbooks and learning materials, and a longer timeframe before it can be fairly judged and begin to bear fruit.\n\nEducation expert Dr Aliyu Tilde praised the reversal, saying Nigeria isn't ready for such a move.\n\n\"Does Nigeria have trained teachers to teach in the dozens of indigenous languages in the country? The answer is no. Also the major exams like WAEC, Jamb are all in English and not in those mother tongue languages.\n\n\"I think what's needed to improve the quality of our schools is bringing in qualified teachers,” he told the BBC.\n\nA mother who has two children in early education schools, Hajara Musa, said she supported the reversal as it would help young children to learn English at an early age.\n\n\"English is a global language that is used everywhere and I feel it's better these kids start using it from the start of their schooling instead of waiting for when they are older,” she told the BBC.\n\nHowever, social affairs analyst Habu Dauda disagreed.\n\n“I think it was scrapped prematurely instead of giving it more time. Three years is too little to judge a big shift such as this - the government ought to have added more investment,\" he said.\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing challenge in Nigeria of balancing the promotion of its rich linguistic heritage with the practical demands of a national curriculum and a globalised economy where English proficiency is dominant.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51qdg5ywgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:19:53.420Z","title":"Caste census: The case for and against counting castes in India","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India is poised to conduct its first nationwide caste census in the 2027 census, marking a major shift in social policy after decades of political hesitation. While advocates argue that detailed caste data can make affirmative action more targeted and equitable—especially in education and employment—critics like scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warn that such a census may reinforce caste hierarchy, reify colonial practices, and turn social inequality into a bureaucratic ledger. Critics argue that caste is too pernicious to be managed and that true social justice requires the destruction of caste, not its enumeration. In contrast, scholars like Satish Deshpande, Mary E John, and Sonalde Desai stress that caste data are essential to understanding both privilege and deprivation, and that a well-designed census could enable more inclusive, rights-based welfare policies. However, challenges remain in data classification, sub-categorization, and potential misuse of results for political gain.

The case for and against counting castes in India\n\nCounting castes in India has always been about more than numbers - it is about who gets a share of government benefits and who doesn't.\n\nThe country's next national census, scheduled for 2027, will -  for the first time in nearly a century - count every caste, a  social hierarchy  that has long outlived kingdoms, empires and ideologies.\n\nThe move ends decades of political hesitation and follows pressure from opposition parties and at least  three states  that have already gone ahead with their own surveys. A 2011 survey - neither run nor verified by census authorities or released by the government - recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names.\n\nA full count of castes promises a sharper picture of who truly benefits from affirmative action and who is left behind. Advocates say it could make welfare spending more targeted and help recalibrate quotas in jobs and education with hard evidence.\n\nYet in a provocative new book, The Caste Con Census, scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warns that the exercise may harden the deeply discriminatory caste system, when the need is to dismantle it.\n\nThe argument cuts against the prevailing view that better data will produce fairer policy. For Mr Teltumbde, castes are \"too pernicious to be managed for any progressive purpose\".\n\n\"Caste is, at its core, a hierarchy seeking impulse that defies measurement,\" he writes.\n\nMr Teltumbde sees the modern caste census as a colonial echo.\n\nBritish administrators began counting castes in 1871 as a \"deliberate response to the post-1857 unity of Indians across caste and religion\", turning it into an \"effective tool of imperial control\". They held six caste censuses between 1871 and 1931 - the last full caste enumeration in India.\n\nEach count, Mr Teltumbde argues, \"did not merely record caste, but reified and hardened it\".\n\nIndependent India, in Mr Teltumbde's reading, preserved the system under the moral banner of social justice, \"while effectively evading its core obligation of building the capacities of all people, which is a prerequisite for the success of any genuine social justice policy\".\n\nThe obsession with counting, he says, bureaucratises inequality. By turning caste into a ledger of entitlements and grievances, the census reduces politics to arithmetic - who gets how much - rather than addressing what Mr Teltumbde calls the \"architecture of social injustice\".\n\nHe sees the demand for a caste census as a push for more reservations - a cause driven by an \"upwardly mobile minority\", while the majority slips into deprivation and dependence on state aid. Nearly 800 million Indians, he notes, now rely on free rations.\n\nAffirmative action quotas were first reserved for Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - and Adivasis (tribespeople), India's most oppressed groups. But soon, the less disadvantaged \"other backward classes\" (OBCs) began clamouring for a share of the pie. Politics quickly coalesced around demands for new or bigger caste-based quotas.\n\nMr Teltumbde's deeper worry is that enumeration legitimises what it measures. Political parties, he warns, will exploit the data to redraw quotas or convert caste resentment into electoral capital.\n\nFor Mr Teltumbde, the only rational politics is one of \"annihilation of caste\", not its management - echoing what BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's constitution, argued when he said that caste cannot be reformed, it \"must be destroyed\".\n\nBut in an India where even its victims \"see value in its preservation\", that goal feels utopian, the author admits. The looming caste census, Mr Teltumbde argues, will not expose inequality but entrench it.\n\nMany scholars don't quite agree, seeing the census as a necessary tool for achieving social justice.\n\nSociologist Satish Deshpande and economist Mary E John call the decision not to count castes \"one of independent India's biggest mistakes\".\n\nToday, they note in a  paper , caste has come to be seen as the burden only of India's lower castes - Dalits and Adivasis - who must constantly prove their identity through official labels.\n\nWhat's needed, they write, is \"a fuller, more inclusive picture where everyone must answer the question of their caste\". This isn't an \"endorsement of an unequal system\", they stress, but a recognition that \"there is no caste disprivilege without a corresponding privilege accruing to some other caste\".\n\nIn other words, the lack of reliable caste data obscures both privilege and deprivation.\n\nSociologist and demographer Sonalde Desai told me that without a fresh caste census, India's affirmative action policies operate \"blindly\", relying on outdated colonial data.\n\n\"If surveys and censuses could shape social reality, we would not need social policies. We could simply start asking questions about domestic violence to shame people into refraining from wife-beating. We have not asked any questions in the census about caste since 1931. Has it eliminated caste equations?\" she asks.\n\nPolitical scientist Sudha Pai, however, broadly agrees with Mr Teltumbde's critique that counting castes can solidify identities and distract from deeper inequalities based on \"land, education, power and dignity\".\n\nYet she acknowledges that caste has already been politicised through welfare and electoral strategies, making a caste census inevitable.\n\n\"A caste census would be useful if the income levels within each caste group are collected. The government could then use the data collected to identify within each caste the needs of the truly needy and offer them the required benefits and opportunities, such as education and jobs for upward mobility,\" Dr Pai says.\n\n\"This would require moving away from simply using caste as the parameter for redistribution of available resources, to use of both caste and income levels in policymaking.\"\n\nDr Pai argues that if done \"thoughtfully\" - linking caste data to income and educational indicators - it could shift India from a \"caste-based to a rights-based welfare system\".\n\nYet, scholars warn that counting castes and interpreting the data will be fraught with challenges.\n\n\"It won't be painless. India has changed tremendously in the century since 1931. Castes that were designated as being poor and vulnerable may have moved out of poverty, some new vulnerabilities may have emerged. So if we are to engage in this exercise honestly, it cannot be done without reshuffling the groups that are eligible for benefits,\" says Professor Desai.\n\nAnother challenge lies in data collection - castes have many subgroups, raising questions about the right level of classification. Sub-categorisation aims to divide broader caste groups into smaller ones so the most disadvantaged among them receive a fair share of quotas and benefits.\n\n\"Castes are not made of a single layer. There are many subgroups within a single caste. What level of aggregation should be used? How will the respondents in a census respond to this question? This requires substantial experimentation. I do not believe this has yet been done,\" says Prof Desai.\n\nMr Teltumbde remains unconvinced. He argues that endless enumeration cannot remedy a system built on hierarchy.\n\n\"You will be counting all your life and still not solve the caste problem. So what will be the use of that counting?,\" he wonders. \"I am not against affirmative action, but this is not the way to do it.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c364yg7g351o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:20:05.081+00:00","title":"Guests ejected mid-stay from bankrupt hotel chain Sonder","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sonder, a short-term rental company based in Montreal that operated in over 40 cities, has declared bankruptcy and initiated insolvency proceedings globally after failing to meet financial obligations and technical integration challenges with Marriott.

five seasons, Stranger Things is coming to an end - but another portal is already opening as the creators behind the show, twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, tell the BBC a spin-off series is already in development.\n\n\"It's early days but we're excited about it,\" says Matt Duffer. \"It's new characters and a new mystery, so it's different, but it will be in the same world as Stranger Things.\"\n\nThe pair feel that there is more to explore, but Matt's twin brother Ross explains they always saw the original story as a self-contained arc and it's definitely \"the end for these characters\".\n\nThe clarity around the ending had always been part of the plan, and Matt says the final scene \"was the one thing we had planned from the start\".\n\n\"We always knew what we were working towards so it was like our north star and we built the whole season around the final scene.\"\n\nSeason five is set in the autumn of 1987. Hawkins, Indiana, is scarred by the opening of the Rifts and the group of friends must find and kill Vecna. At the same time, the town is under military quarantine as the hunt for Eleven intensifies.\n\nThe brothers, who were in their early thirties when the show began, had always planned for four or five seasons, but say it still feels surreal that they managed to get that far.\n\nWhat started as a nostalgic horror about a missing boy in a sleepy town quickly grew into one of Netflix's biggest global hits.\n\n\"When you're making the show, you're so entrenched in it that you forget how far it's come, and every season we put everything we have into it,\" Ross says. \"And when we made season one, we didn't even know if we'd get a second.\"\n\nIt's a feeling the cast shared. Joe Keery, whose character Steve Harrington goes from a high school jock to a heroic mentor-like figure, tells the BBC he remembers saying goodbye to everyone after season one and not being sure if he would see them again.\n\n\"Season one felt like an indie film and now it's this crazy big-budget movie,\" the 33-year-old says in disbelief.\n\nBy the time the final season wrapped, after a year of filming, \"it felt like we'd been working on it forever\".\n\n\"But we had a great time making it and the friendships we made aren't going anywhere. We will still be in each other's lives.\"\n\nNatalia Dyer, who plays Nancy Wheeler, says the friendships they've built off camera mirror those of their on-screen characters.\n\n\"These characters have this shared secret world they all know about and in real life, we have something similar as we're the only people who know the show inside-out.\"\n\nCharlie Heaton, who plays Natalia's on-screen boyfriend Jonathan Byers, agrees and explains that \"the events in the show change these characters' lives forever, and similarly this show has changed our lives forever\".\n\nThere have been reports that not everything has been plain sailing.  The Mail on Sunday recently reported  that Millie Bobby Brown filed a harassment and bullying claim against her co-star David Harbour, but that hasn't been confirmed.\n\nHowever, the cast insist there's a close friendship between everyone, while the Duffer brothers say they felt an immense responsibility to protect the younger cast throughout filming.\n\n\"When we cast them we didn't know the show was going to be what it was and you hear so many horror stories about young people that become famous as the spotlight can be harsh,\" Ross says.\n\n\"I think it helped that there were so many younger cast members so they weren't going through anything alone and could turn to each other during challenging times.\"\n\nThat solidarity was a vital help for Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler and says growing up in the spotlight was a challenge \"because you're going through puberty and a life change like being part of Stranger Things at the same time\".\n\nHis on-screen, and perhaps also off-screen, best friends Caleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo agree, and the trio start laughing about how young they were when they first met.\n\nI ask the young men how they feel about the show ending and stepping into new projects, and Gaten is first to admit they feel some trepidation.\n\n\"I'm a bit shaky and there is a bit of anxiety, but I think that's the point.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old, who plays Dustin Henderson, says now feels like a good time to step into a period of unknown.\n\n\"Your twenties are all about change, transition and growing, and we're incredibly lucky to be in a position to establish consistency in our careers.\n\n\"I see that as a real blessing and I look at it optimistically as I can because it is scary to not have the comfort of knowing there's another Stranger Things season.\"\n\nThe legacy of the show is undeniable - it's transformed a cast of newcomers into stars and spawned a global fanbase who have grown up alongside it.\n\nCaleb hopes that connection lasts and the show \"lives on and becomes one of those things that people will rewatch and never get tired of, like a classic film\".\n\nKnowing the impact of the show made saying goodbye even harder, and the final day of shooting is something Caleb won't forget for a while.\n\n\"Everyone was there and it bought us back to episode one - that feeling of home, being supported and loved, and everyone was on the same page in terms of their connection with the show,\" he says.\n\nNetflix has announced an animated follow-up, while details of the Duffer brothers' live-action spin-off are still under wraps.\n\nIt's the end of an era for the current cast. But would they reunite for another project?\n\n\"Our part of the Stranger Things story is done for now,\" Gaten says. \"But if they called us in a while, who knows?\"\n\nThe first four episodes of season five will be available in the US from 26 November, with the next three arriving on Christmas Day, and the finale on New Year's Eve. In the UK those releases will be a day later."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly98qp99l8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:00:11.235+00:00","title":"Why Ukraine is bracing for its 'worst winter' of the war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine is bracing for its worst winter of the war due to intensified Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, particularly targeting power and gas networks in eastern regions.

The lift to her eighth-floor apartment often stops, the lights go out and sometimes the pumps maintaining pressure in the gas central heating fail.\n\nShe has a big rechargeable battery pack to keep appliances going, but it costs €2,000 (£1,770) and it only lasts so long. Her husband Ievgen, a lawyer, often has to work by torchlight. Their two-year-old daughter Katia plays by candlelight too.\n\nAmid air raids and cold darkness, Oksana says she and Ievgen worry constantly for Katia. \"I can't describe with words the animal fear when you take your child to the shelter during the explosions.\n\n\"I have never felt anything like that in my life and I wouldn't want anyone to feel anything like that. The thought that she might be scared because there's no light - this is terrible.\"\n\nAll across Ukraine, families are bracing themselves for even tougher times ahead - a long, cold winter in which Russian President Vladimir Putin attempts to finish off his invasion by striking Ukraine's power supplies and networks.\n\nJust last weekend, a massive drone and missile strike left much of the country for a time without power. Ukrainians are now enduring regular power cuts of up to 16 hours a day.\n\nIn winter, temperatures in Ukraine can plummet as low as -20C. One senior government figure told me they expect the next few months to be brutal.\n\n\"I think it will be the worst winter of our history,\" says the official. \"Russia will destroy our energy, our infrastructure, our heating. All state institutions should be prepared for the worst scenario.\"\n\nMaxim Timchenko, the chief executive of DTEK, a large private energy company in Ukraine, says: \"Based on the intensity of attacks for the past two months, it is clear Russia is aiming for the complete destruction of Ukraine's energy system.\"\n\nBut according to one European envoy, it's not just about people being cold at night or without light - there is more to Russia's strategy.\n\n\"[This] is also about them not getting any bread from the bakery in the morning and not being able to go to work because there is no power for the factory,\" says the envoy.\n\nAs the official puts it: \"The goal of the Russians is to kill our economy.\"\n\nSo how exactly will this strategy play out? And given that almost four years of war have taken their toll, what does it mean for Ukraine's people - and the future of this long, hard war?\n\nOn the front line, the news is bleak. There are growing signs that the key eastern city of Pokrovsk may fall, giving Russian forces a boost in morale and a fresh platform to seize more of the Donetsk region.\n\nAnother issue that could impact morale is a massive corruption scandal affecting the government.\n\nProsecutors have accused ministers and officials of taking kickbacks from contracts to build defensive structures around Ukraine's nuclear plants. Both of the ministers accused deny the allegations. But the risk for President Zelensky is that Ukrainians, many of whom are living in the cold and the dark, may lose trust in the administration.\n\nWhat's more, for now, diplomatic efforts to end the war appear to be on hold.\n\nPlans of a summit between Putin and US President Donald Trump are on the back burner after Moscow refused to budge from its maximalist war aims and the US imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas.\n\n\"There is currently a pause,\" a Kremlin spokesman said this week, \"the situation is stalled.\"\n\nAll the while, European nations squabble over what to do with €180bn (£160bn) in frozen Russian assets. They plan to use the cash to raise a so-called \"repatriation loan\" for Ukraine, repaid only if Russia ever pays reparations after the end of the war.\n\nBut a row over how to share the risk has left Kyiv's coffers looking distinctly bare.\n\nYet it is the energy crisis that is worrying the Ukrainian government most, according to those I spoke to. \"People are tired after four years of the war,\" the official tells me.\n\n\"I am afraid they will be demotivated.\"\n\nWalk the streets of Kyiv and you'll pass a sea of tired faces - people's eyes are red from a lack of sleep, their rest broken by the air raid sirens.\n\n\"I am tired of not sleeping enough,\" says Yana Kolomiets, 31, a casting director from Odesa. \"But... people who fight on the front line are tired [too].\"\n\nA recent scientific study suggested that people are three times more likely to suffer from insomnia in Ukraine than in countries at peace.\n\nIt tracked the sleep patterns of around 100 Ukrainians over six months, and found the insomnia persisted even on quiet nights. (The research was published by Texty, a data journalism website based in Ukraine.)\n\nThere have not been many quiet nights. Russia launched vast numbers of ballistic missiles at Ukraine in October - some 268 in all, the highest monthly total since the full-scale invasion, according to analysis published by the Oboz news site. The same month Russia launched 5,298 Shahed and other bomber drones.\n\nDiplomats suggest there is a geographic focus to Russia's tactics, their strikes deliberately targeting gas and electricity transmission networks in eastern Ukraine, rather than power stations in the west of the country.\n\n\"They are trying to cut Ukraine in two in terms of energy,\" one European envoy says. \"They want anywhere east of the river Dnipro to be cold this winter.\"\n\nThe aim, one government source told me, is to \"instigate an insurrection, so that people go against the government in Kyiv… they are trying to destroy social cohesion.\"\n\nSo concerned is the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs it has already issued a formal warning, saying \"the approaching winter poses new risks for Ukrainians... as intensified attacks on energy networks undermine efforts to maintain warmth in homes, schools and health centres\".\n\nUncertainty over the outcome of the various diplomatic initiatives hasn't helped, either.\n\nAnd yet opinion polls suggest people in Ukraine may in fact be more hopeful, not less.\n\nResearch by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, a pollster, suggested that in October 56% of 1,008 Ukrainians interviewed felt optimistic about the country's future, up from 43% in May.\n\nSasha, a Kyiv-based financier, explains that Ukrainian morale is volatile, swinging wildly between optimism and pessimism.\n\n\"If people talk about an end to the war, they feel hopeful,\" he says. \"But then when the talks fail, they despair.\"\n\nOksana, though, is pragmatic: she says that for all the fears for her daughter, they have no choice but to endure it.\n\n\"I always think it is much worse at the front line,\" she adds. \"There are boys and girls on the front line who suffer much, much more.\n\n\"I understand my child should not be raised in these conditions, because it is not normal in the civilised world. But we can hold on for as long as the front needs it.\"\n\nEarlier this week, thick fog enabled Russian troops to move further into Pokrovsk.\n\nThe news out of the city is bleak with daily reports of Russian advances. If it fell, it would be the first major city seized by Russia since Avdiivka in February 2024.\n\nBut Russian forces would still only be about 25 miles (40km) from where they began their full scale invasion in 2022, land gained at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the Russian high command is throwing so much at Pokrovsk not just because it is tactically significant, but because Putin wants a victory he can \"sell\" diplomatically to the White House.\n\nThe Russians hope to convince President Trump they are making battlefield gains that will put pressure on Kyiv to sue for peace.\n\nVadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's former foreign minister and ambassador in London, said Russia wanted to \"force this feeling among Europe and westerners – as Russian propagandists have done before – that you can't do anything with Russia, you can't defeat Mother Russia.\n\n\"They hope that our partners will force us to lose face and sign the Russian deal, whatever that is.\"\n\nWhen I asked President Zelensky if his people could survive the coming winter at a recent press conference, he was clear about the scale of the challenge.\n\n\"I don't know what winter will be but we have to prepare in any case,\" he answered.\n\n\"We understand what we have to do, we understand what we need and our partners also know from us what, in the case of difficulties, what volume of electricity we have to import.\"\n\nUkraine imports gas from across Europe, including Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. But it also has massive storage facilities which Russia could target.\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Centre, says Ukraine is well placed to protect its energy supply from Russian attacks. \"We are better trained, we know how to act, we have no panic,\" he says.\n\n\"We have an understanding of what to do if something is damaged. It will be complicated, it will be a hard winter, there will be a lot of outages but it will be manageable.\"\n\nUkraine's prime minister is confident. Yulia Svyrydenko said Russia's goal was \"to plunge Ukraine into darkness. Ours is to preserve the light.\"\n\nNonetheless, this may be harder to achieve if Trump focuses on other matters and turns his attention away from Ukraine - likewise if European voters elect governments that are less supportive of Kyiv and cannot wean themselves off Russian energy.\n\nThe danger is that war fatigue will overcome strategic patience.\n\nBut for all the bleak realism of the official government source, even he remains confident. \"This winter is the last opportunity for the Russians to defeat us,\" he said. \"And if we make it to 1 April, we will win the war.\"\n\nI asked one western diplomat why Ukrainians were so unyielding. \"They are just bloody-minded,\" the envoy said, and pointed to Ukraine's long history of withstanding hardship.\n\n\"They say they have survived the Germans, the Poles, the Turks, the Lithuanians and now they can survive the Russians.\"\n\nAnd yet for many in Ukraine, life is going on as usual - or as usual as it can.\n\nAt the Dynamo Stadium in Kyiv, beneath the floodlights, a game of football is being played - Dynamo Kyiv versus Shakhtar Donetsk. It's a rough, partisan game where the hardcore fans, known as ultras, wear masks and chant at their opponents.\n\nOne of the few signs that this is taking place in a city at war is the number of people there: the stadium can seat more than 16,000 people but only 4,300 fans are allowed in, owing to the capacity of the stadium's bomb shelters.\n\nThe fans have come from all parts of society – young and old, families and friends. Servicemen and women are there too, earning applause from the crowds, who part to let them pass through.\n\n\"It's really important to continue to live,\" says Anatoliy Anatolich, the match announcer, a TV and social media host.\n\nIn his view, coming to the football in itself is an act of defiance.\n\n\"[It shows] everyone that we are not going to leave our country in this hard period… We've got to be here when we win.\"\n\nFive minutes before the end of the match, the chanting suddenly stops. The fans put their hands on their hearts and sing the national anthem.\n\nSoon the whole stadium was singing as one; a crowd divided by teams, but united by country.\n\nTop image credit: AFP/Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

How D.C. Area Businesses Aided Furloughed Workers, One Gesture at a Time\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:02:32-05:00\n\nThe end of the longest government shutdown in American history is finally in sight, a relief for hundreds of thousands of federal employees across the country who have gone without pay for weeks.\n\nThe month and a half of uncertainty has been especially hard on Washington, D.C., and neighboring Maryland and Virginia, where more than 400,000 federal employees live and work. The region was already unsettled this year by sweeping government layoffs, funding cuts and the deployment of federal forces to the streets of the capital.\n\nFood banks and other charitable organizations have aided struggling families, who in many cases have also received city government assistance. But local businesses have also stepped in to help disheartened federal employees.\n\nIn and around Washington, businesses have provided meals, workout classes and financial services free of charge. They have offered discounts or waived fees on auto repairs, electrical work and veterinarian visits, and, in some cases, just created a welcoming place.\n\nOn Friday, P.C. Zai, who was furloughed from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was at the Fibre Space yarn shop in Alexandria, Va., working on what would be a teal-colored raglan sweater. Her dog, Mazie, was at her feet.\n\nThe shop has offered free knitting classes and an independent study for federal workers like Ms. Zai, who said she had filled her days with activities to relieve some of the stress of the shutdown.\n\n“Some people are completely locked down and freaking out — and it’s understandable,” she said. “But I think it helps to be in community for a little bit.”\n\nUp the stairs and at the back of Fibre Space, a sunny room was packed with women of all ages on Friday afternoon.\n\nDanielle Romanetti, who opened the yarn shop in 2009, has offered free beginner lessons to federal employees during shutdowns dating back to the one in 2013, during the Obama administration. Furloughed workers have volunteered to run most of those sessions.\n\nAshley Bander, who lives in Alexandria and has been volunteering since being furloughed last month, joked that it was “almost like having a job — I’ve been here six hours a day sometimes.”\n\nAs Ms. Bander finished the last few stitches of a chunky cardigan, the others in the room cheered. She had started the project at the beginning of the shutdown.\n\n“People who have been through this before can share some lessons with people doing this for the first time,” Ms. Bander said, adding, “There’s such a nice feeling of solidarity.”\n\nIn Bethesda, Md., just north of Washington, the minister of the Westmoreland Congregational United Church of Christ has tried to foster community spirit in a more traditional way: by opening the church’s sanctuary once a week to furloughed workers.\n\nBut it is not too traditional. The minister, Yonce Shelton, said he often organized community events open to anyone, regardless of their spirituality. He said he had been asked whether there were any limits on who could use the sanctuary, and whether people could bring in books or laptops.\n\n“‘I think God’s OK with however you need to be in this place,’” was his response, Mr. Shelton said.\n\nHe added, “If one or two or three people find it, get some peace, to pray, think, yell, whatever — then that’s worth it.”\n\nBusiness has plummeted at Airlie, a hotel and event venue in Warrenton, Va., more than 50 miles outside of Washington, as federal funding cuts led to canceled conferences and other events, said Josh Reichert, the managing director.\n\nBut surrounding Fauquier County has thousands of federal employees, he said. During the shutdown, Airlie has offered a free weekly buffet lunch for federal workers. Last week, it also provided therapy dogs and live music.\n\n“Hospitality at its core is just about taking care of people,” Mr. Reichert said. “That means taking care of our community. Usually we’re inviting those outside of our community in, and this is our way of being hospitable to our locals and our neighbors.”\n\nSandy Patterson, a chef who runs the miXT food hall in Brentwood, Md., just outside Washington, said sales dropped by half in the middle of October, around the time that many federal workers got their last paychecks.\n\nBut during the shutdown, vendors have offered cheap and nutritious meals, including a $5 chicken, broccoli and rice bowl. Earlier this year, the food hall hosted networking events, a résumé workshop and free headshots for federal workers amid layoffs.\n\n“The community,” Ms. Patterson said, “has a ton of empathy for each other and wants to help out other people. It just doesn’t feel like we’re feeling that from the government right now.”\n\nEphrem Abebe and Steve Chu, the co-founders of Ekiben, a fast-casual Asian fusion restaurant in Baltimore, noticed that there was less support for federal workers in their city. So they posted a video to Instagram offering any item on their menu free of charge to federal workers.\n\nIt went viral, and Ekiben began making 500 food boxes each morning for World Central Kitchen, an aid group founded by the celebrity chef José Andrés, which hands them out to federal workers.\n\n“I think what people are going through right now doesn’t really have a geographical location,” Mr. Chu said. “People are hungry, people are stressed, and these are all things that we can empathize with.”\n\nMany other businesses, big and small, have tried to help those who might be struggling.\n\nBobby McLaughlin, an electrician and the owner of a small electrical contracting business in King George, Va., near a naval support facility where many federal workers have been working without pay, recognized that some might not be able to afford a steep bill in an emergency situation. He posted to Facebook that he would provide a pay-later option for federal workers.\n\n“If the power goes out, that is a big deal,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “I’m just trying to give people some peace of mind.”\n\nRoda, an auto service based in Rockville, Md., has been offering discounts on car repairs to current and former federal employees. It was first introduced in February during the mass federal layoffs, said Rachel Lubin, Roda’s chief executive, in order “to mitigate stress for a group of people for whom life has become even more stressful than normal.”\n\nIn Washington, the Friendship Hospital for Animals has waived emergency exam fees and offered interest-free payments. The hospital said it had helped almost 20 families take care of their pets.\n\nRebecca Ferguson-Ondrey, who was fired from the Health and Human Services Department in February, co-founded Wellfed, an organization supporting current and former federal workers. She said people and businesses had donated their time and services to the group’s events — from financial planning advice to bagels and a yoga session.\n\nMs. Ferguson-Ondrey said Wellfed’s programming would continue even after the shutdown ended.\n\n“It’s a big question mark as to what the federal government is going to look like on the other side of this,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/epstein-emails-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:46:16-05:00","title":"What Newly Released Emails Tell Us About Epstein and Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Democrats released a series of emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, revealing communications between Epstein and prominent figures, including Donald Trump and Michael Wolff.

President Trump may have been more aware of Mr. Epstein’s conduct than he has publicly acknowledged.\n\nSoon after, House Republicans released more than 20,000 pages of Mr. Epstein’s documents, including a vast trove of his emails and other messages covering a period of many years.\n\nIn a post on social media, Mr. Trump said the Democrats were bringing up the Epstein “hoax” to deflect from the government shutdown.

The tabloids had recently spotted him out and about, trying to return to his old social circles. Mr. Epstein was sensitive to what was being said about him, emailing with his employees about negative news coverage. Mr. Trump, now a star on his reality television show, “The Apprentice,” was talking publicly about running for president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee said on X that the victim the email exchanged referred to was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was 16 when she was recruited by Mr. Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell while she was working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.\n\nWhen Mr. Epstein sent the email in April 2011, Ms. Giuffre had recently gone public for the first time about her experiences with Mr. Epstein, telling a British tabloid that he had abused her and trafficked her to other men and providing the outlet with a now-famous photo of herself, Prince Andrew and Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Giuffre was asked in a civil case if Mr. Trump had witnessed the sexual abuse of minors in Mr. Epstein’s home, and she said, “I don’t think Donald Trump participated in anything.” A representative for Ms. Giuffre’s family declined to comment.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto jeffrey E.

Mr. Epstein was dealing with fallout from his conduct but was far from the infamous figure he is now.\n\nStill, Mr. Epstein continued to socialize with notable people. Among them was the journalist Michael Wolff, who encouraged Mr. Epstein to speak out about Mr. Trump and went on to write a biography of the president early in his first administration.\n\nDuring a presidential debate on Dec. 15, 2015, Mr. Trump did not field any questions about Mr. Epstein, according to a transcript, despite an assertion about a media appearance that day by Mr. Wolff beforehand.

A series of Miami Herald articles showed that he received lenient treatment from prosecutors years earlier, including from Alexander Acosta, who was Mr. Trump’s labor secretary at the time.\n\nMr. Epstein’s schedules showed he had continued to meet with Mr. Wolff, who has said he sat in on some unreleased recorded interviews that Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, had conducted with Mr. Epstein.\n\nSoon after this email exchange, the Justice Department said it was investigating how Mr. Epstein’s plea deal had been handled.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n10/29/2016 12:21:03 PM\n\nThere's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him.

It was unclear specifically what Mr. Wolff believed Mr. Epstein would say or whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message.\n\nOne theme that has emerged from the emails is how Mr. Wolff appeared to act as an adviser to Mr. Epstein and suggested he speak publicly against Mr. Trump.\n\nIn another email exchange earlier in 2016, Mr. Wolff advised Mr. Epstein to take an “anti-Trump position” as a way to get ahead of the upcoming release of the book “Filthy Rich” about Mr. Epstein’s life and crimes.\n\nImportance: High\n\nto jeffrey E.

Mr. Black replied that Mr. Acosta would be by himself, with “perhaps a trump administration to assist and accompany him.”\n\nThe Epstein deal was brought up during Mr. Acosta’s confirmation hearing. Mr. Acosta defended it, saying it was offered based on the evidence he had at the time. Mr. Acosta was confirmed, but he would resign in 2019, after Mr. Epstein was charged in New York.

But Mr. Epstein remained intently focused on Mr. Trump for years afterward, seeking to exploit the remnants of their relationship up until his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nIn more than 20,000 pages of Mr. Epstein’s typo-strewn emails and other messages released by a congressional committee on Wednesday, Mr. Epstein insulted Mr. Trump and hinted that he had damaging information on him.\n\nBy turns gossipy, scathing and scheming, the messages show influential people pressing Mr. Epstein for insight into Mr. Trump, and Mr. Epstein casting himself as the ultimate Trump translator, someone who knew him intimately and was “the one able to take him down.”\n\nThe release of the messages instantly pushed the two men’s much-scrutinized relationship back into the public eye, re-energizing Democratic attacks on Mr. Trump and his Justice Department for failing to publicly disclose more information from the investigation of Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe emails date to at least 2011, when Mr. Trump was a reality TV star toying with a long-shot presidential run and Mr. Epstein was trying to rehabilitate his image after his conviction and incarceration for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The messages continue through the spring of 2019, when Mr. Trump was president and his Justice Department was building a criminal case against Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe messages hint that Mr. Epstein or his advisers believed they had inside — and potentially damaging — knowledge of Mr. Trump’s far-flung properties and business dealings. Some suggest that Mr. Epstein thought Mr. Trump knew more about his personal conduct than the president has publicly acknowledged.\n\nThe trove doesn’t appear to include messages from Mr. Trump or anyone purporting to speak on his behalf. The president responded on social media on Wednesday, writing that “the Democrats are using the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax to try and deflect from their massive failures, in particular, their most recent one — THE SHUTDOWN!”\n\nThe emails, the latest batch of Epstein-related documents, were obtained from the Epstein estate in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee. They offer a clear window into his day-to-day communications with friends and associates.\n\nBut they are unlikely to quell the furor around the Trump-Epstein relationship. A core part of Mr. Trump’s base believes the mother lode of documents, audio files and video related to Mr. Epstein are in the possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department. A slice of those documents has been released only in small, curated batches.\n\nThe basic contours of their relationship have long been known. Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were friends in the 1980s and 1990s, attending social events in New York or Florida together. One of Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriends has accused Mr. Trump of groping her, an allegation that Mr. Trump has denied. Mr. Trump has said that he cut ties with Mr. Epstein after his associates recruited teenage girls from Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nBut the new emails show that Mr. Epstein was closely following Mr. Trump’s business decisions and political fortunes.\n\nIn April 2011, Mr. Epstein wrote to his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted of helping orchestrate Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation, that Mr. Trump was the “dog that hasn’t barked.” One of Mr. Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, had recently gone public about her experiences with Mr. Epstein — telling a British tabloid that he had abused her and trafficked her to other men, and providing the outlet with a now famous photo of herself, Prince Andrew and Ms. Maxwell.\n\nImportance: High\n\nGmax [email protected]\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n4/2/2011 7:09:39 PM\n\nI have been thinking about that…\n\nJeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\nto Gmax [email protected]\n\nSat Apr 02 14:25:45 2011\n\ni want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump... VICTIM spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.  police chief. etc.  im 75% there\n\nMr. Epstein’s email said that Ms. Giuffre had “spent hours at my house with him” — Mr. Trump — yet Mr. Trump “has never once been mentioned.” Ms. Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that Mr. Trump never had sex with her or even flirted with her.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Epstein emailed one of his lawyers, Reid Weingarten, and suggested that he get someone to dig into Mr. Trump’s finances, including the mortgage on Mar-a-Lago and a $30 million loan Mr. Epstein said that Mr. Trump had received. Reached on Wednesday, Mr. Weingarten declined to comment, saying he was limited by attorney-client privilege.\n\nAs Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign gained traction in December 2015, Mr. Epstein asked Landon Thomas Jr., then a New York Times reporter, “would you like photso of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen”?\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Epstein actually possessed such photos. Mr. Thomas, who has not worked at The Times since 2019, said Mr. Epstein never provided them. Mr. Epstein also told him about a time when he said Mr. Trump was “so focused” on watching young women in a swimming pool that he bumped into a door, “leaving his nose print on the glass.”\n\nA few months later, in March 2016, Mr. Epstein was bracing for the publication of a book, “Filthy Rich,” that detailed allegations against him. The journalist Michael Wolff, who had a longstanding relationship with Mr. Epstein, told him that he needed to serve up a “counter narrative” to the forthcoming book.\n\n“I believe Trump offers an ideal opportunity,” Mr. Wolff wrote. “It’s a chance to make the story about something other than you.” It is unclear whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message and acted on Mr. Wolff’s advice.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n3/18/2016 3:39:39 PM\n\nA few things to think about:\n\nIf the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience.\n\nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps some social media efforts.\n\nA couple of months later, Mr. Wolff told Mr. Epstein that he would be interviewing Mr. Trump. “Anything you think I should ask?” he wrote.\n\nMr. Epstein replied with a list of “provocative” questions, including about the Trump Shuttle airline, a casino bankruptcy and his debts. “otherwise you can just throw easys,” Mr. Epstein wrote.\n\nMr. Wolff did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Epstein repeatedly insulted Mr. Trump. In a January 2018 email to Mr. Wolff, Mr. Epstein referred to the president as “dopey donald” and “demented donald,” saying that his finances were “all a sham.”\n\nLater that year, Mr. Epstein emailed with Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Harvard University president, about Mr. Trump. Mr. Epstein called him “borderline insane.”\n\nImportance: High\n\nLarry Summers\n\nto J [email protected]\n\n12/22/2018 12:52:50 PM\n\nOf course. Who knows whether I'm serious?

I hope someone close to him gets indicted, but not sure, otherwise the pressure of the unkown will force him to do crazy things.”\n\nMr. Summers declined to comment and referred to previous statements in which he acknowledged “regretting my past associations with Mr. Epstein.”\n\nMany of the messages referring to Mr. Trump are banal. Mr. Epstein’s staff discussed whether Mr. Trump’s arrival at the Palm Beach, Fla., airport would impede the movements of Mr. Epstein’s jet. Friends and advisers frequently sent Mr. Epstein links to news articles about Mr. Trump’s political rise, his policies and investigations into his administration and allies. And associates peppered Mr. Epstein with questions about what Mr. Trump’s presidency might mean for geopolitics and financial markets.\n\n“trump ., is scaring the markets not china,” Mr. Epstein wrote in August 2015 to an unidentified acquaintance who had asked about economic turmoil.\n\nBy late 2018, the authorities were closing in on Mr. Epstein. A series of articles in The Miami Herald showed that Mr. Trump’s labor secretary had signed off on Mr. Epstein’s 2008 plea deal. The Herald series prompted the Justice Department to open a wide-ranging criminal investigation into Mr. Epstein.\n\nThat December, Mr. Epstein was texting with an unidentified acquaintance, who wrote that “they’re really just trying to take down Trump and doing whatever they can to do that…!”\n\n“its wild,” Mr. Epstein replied. “because i am the one able to take him down.”\n\n12/02/18 05:26:08 AM\n\nIt will all blow over!

Mr. Kahn called the form “100 pages of nonsense.” He identified nine “interesting findings” about Mr. Trump’s debts, income and charitable foundation.\n\nIt isn’t clear why Mr. Kahn was digging into Mr. Trump’s finances or whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message.\n\nOver the preceding months, Mr. Kahn had sent Mr. Epstein numerous other emails with links to articles about topics like the investigations Mr. Trump was facing over Russian interference in the 2016 election. A lawyer for Mr. Kahn didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt other points, Mr. Epstein asked acquaintances whether they had information on the lawyers who were representing Mr. Trump. It is unclear why Mr. Epstein was asking.\n\nReporting was contributed by Devlin Barrett, Luke Broadwater, Andrew Chavez, Kirsten Danis, Dylan Freedman, Michael Gold, Matthew Goldstein, Will Houp, Teresa Mondría Terol and Glenn Thrush.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/lindsey-halligan-trump-attorney-court-challenge.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:02:18-05:00","title":"Comey and James Challenge Appointment of Trump Loyalist Prosecuting Them","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge is preparing to rule on whether U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, appointed by President Trump in September 2025, was lawfully in office when she personally obtained and presented indictments against former FBI Director James B.

Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general.\n\nThe cases are playing out separately, but lawyers for Mr. Comey and Ms. James have joined forces to ask the judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, to throw out both sets of charges if she determines that Ms. Halligan was improperly installed at Mr. Trump’s direct command in September.\n\nThe lawyers say this drastic step is needed because, in a highly unusual move, Ms. Halligan secured the indictments personally — after none of her subordinates would do so — and was the only person to sign the charging documents.\n\n“When Ms. Halligan presented Mr. Comey’s indictment to the grand jury — just days before the statute of limitations expired — she purported to hold the mantle of U.S. attorney,” lawyers wrote in court papers this week. “But in fact, she was no different than a private citizen.”\n\nJudge Currie has signaled she is interested in precisely that issue.

Family of Fisherman Killed in U.S. Military Strike Says It Wants Justice\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T14:08:01-05:00\n\nOne day in mid-September, Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman who, his family said, had long plied the Caribbean in search of marlin and tuna, called his teenage daughter. He told her he was going fishing, she said, and would return in a few days.\n\nHe never made it back.\n\nThe day after he left, on Sept. 15, his family, fellow fishermen and Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, say Mr. Carranza was killed in a U.S. military strike on his boat. The furor about what happened to him  has ignited a feud over the huge U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and the legality of the deadly attacks on nearly 20 vessels since September.\n\nCaribbean Sea\n\nSanta Marta\n\nThe New York Times\n\n“I never thought I would lose my father in this way,” said Cheila Carranza, 14, this week, holding back tears as she gazed at a photo of him on her phone in her grandmother’s crowded home, where she lives in one room with her mother and two siblings.\n\nAs the death toll climbs from U.S. strikes on boats in waters near Latin America, tensions are increasing with Colombia, which had long been a top U.S. ally in the region. So far, 19 U.S. strikes have killed at least 76 people.\n\nThe attacks have enraged Mr. Petro, who accused the United States of murdering Mr. Carranza in one attack. President Trump responded by imposing sanctions on Mr. Petro and his family and moving to slash aid to the country. This week, Colombia suspended intelligence sharing with the United States until the Trump administration stops its strikes.\n\nThe Trump administration claims the attacks occurred on boats carrying illicit drugs that kill thousands of Americans. But many legal experts in the United States and elsewhere say the strikes violate international law because those killed, even if they had been suspected of committing any crimes, did not present an immediate threat.\n\nMangled bodies have begun washing up on the beaches of Trinidad and Tobago after U.S. strikes in the region. The only two known survivors of the strikes are not from Venezuela, but Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nThe Trump administration has called Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, the leader of a drug cartel and has privately said that the goal of the U.S. deployment, the largest in decades in Latin America, is to push the authoritarian leader from power.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided evidence, aside from descriptions of intelligence assessments and declassified portions of video images, that any of the vessels it has destroyed were carrying drugs. At the same time, in Mr. Carranza’s case, there is no immediate ability to determine with certainty if he was simply a fisherman or had been involved in drug smuggling.\n\nMr. Petro, in a news conference last month, said Mr. Carranza was from a traditional fishing family, but “may have been involved very intermittently’’ with drugs.\n\nMany fishermen in coastal and island communities, he said, become involved in drug transport because poverty leaves them few alternatives.\n\nThe strikes have left Mr. Carranza’s family reeling and grasping for answers, offering a rare glimpse into the strain the U.S. deployment can inflict on those left behind as the toll from the deadly attacks continues to climb. The family has hired an American lawyer, who said he was preparing a legal claim.\n\nKaterine Hernández, the mother of three of Mr. Carranza’s children, disputed Mr. Trump’s claim that the strike that killed her former partner, along with two other people on the same boat, had targeted “confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela.”\n\n“Alejandro had nothing to do with Venezuela; he spent his entire life here in Colombia,” said Ms. Hernández, 37, in an interview in Santa Marta, a sun-drenched city on Colombia’s northern coast where she met Mr. Carranza when she was 13.\n\nMr. Carranza, 42, also occasionally took jobs piloting boats for others in the waters around Santa Marta, his family and other fishermen said, raising the possibility that the boat he was in was transporting something illicit with or without his knowledge.\n\nBut Ms. Hernández said that Mr. Carranza had never been involved in smuggling drugs. “If he was some kind of narcoterrorist,” she said, “then why are we living in misery instead of a mansion?”\n\nDespite separating several years ago, Ms. Hernández said, she and Mr. Carranza remained close. Until recently, she and the children had lived with his parents. While he rarely earned more than Colombia’s monthly minimum wage, about $382, she said, he always put food on the table for her and the children.\n\nNow, Ms. Hernández said, they were subsisting on the kindness of relatives who themselves have next to nothing. She and the three children are living in her mother’s home in Gaira, a gritty area of Santa Marta not far from the city’s glistening beaches.\n\nDan Kovalik, an American lawyer hired by Mr. Carranza’s family, said that even if Mr. Carranza had been suspected of piloting a boat carrying illicit drugs, it would have been illegal to kill him.\n\n“If the people on the boat were suspected of drug trafficking, they should have been arrested, not killed,” said Mr. Kovalik, who plans on filing suit in the United States and seeking damages for Mr. Carranza’s family.\n\nThe identities of the other two men aboard the boat remain unknown.\n\n“This case is important from two points of view,” Mr. Kovalik added. “First, the family deserves compensation for the loss.”\n\n“Second, we want this case to help stop these killings from taking place again,” Mr. Kovalik said. “This is murder, and it is destroying rule of law.”\n\nThe Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince Mr. Carranza departed on the fishing trip two months ago, Ms. Hernández said, their lives have been shattered.\n\nBefore the U.S. strike, she said, she had already been unable to work after a motorcycle accident severely damaged her right leg — near the place on her ankle where she still has Mr. Carranza’s first name, tattooed.\n\nThe school fees for Zaira, their 17-year-old daughter, have gone unpaid, she said, while their son, Libiston, 11, was traumatized after another child showed him the video shared by Mr. Trump, apparently showing the father’s boat being blown to pieces.\n\nMs. Hernández said that some people had questioned whether Mr. Carranza had even been killed at all since his body has not been recovered. Others have tried to insinuate that he was involved in drug smuggling, she said, because of a previous brush with the law.\n\nIn a case from 2012, Mr. Carranza had taken part in a scheme to steal weapons that had been confiscated in legal proceedings, according to Colombian officials. Ms. Hernández and Adenis Manjarres, 30, Mr. Carranza’s first cousin, both said that Mr. Carranza had never been jailed in connection to the case. Colombian officials did not have more information on the disposition of the case.\n\nLeonardo Vega, 40, a longtime friend of Mr. Carranza’s who is the leader of a fisherman’s association in Santa Marta, said he was certain that Mr. Carranza was killed in the Sept. 15 strike.\n\nUpon seeing the attack on social media, Mr. Vega said that the type of boat in the video was precisely the kind used by fishermen from Santa Marta, in contrast to differently designed boats departing from Venezuela.\n\n“I immediately thought, ‘He’s one of ours,’” said Mr. Vega. He added that the destroyed boat had two motors instead of the three or four used on boats typically used to smuggle drugs or other contraband.\n\nFishermen can be gone for a week or so, often sleeping in hammocks on deserted beaches, he said.\n\n“But two months gone, no way,” Mr. Vega added. Looking at factors like the dates of Mr. Carranza’s departure and that of the U.S. attack, along with the boat seen in the video, he said he could come to only one conclusion: “Sadly, my friend is dead.”\n\nMr. Vega said Mr. Carranza had been well known for his easygoing personality among other fishermen in Santa Marta. He was known by the nickname “Coroncoro,” which refers to a small fish typically found in the area, and enjoyed drinking beer and playing pool.\n\nBeyond what Mr. Carranza’s family is grappling with, the U.S. strikes have struck fear among Santa Marta’s fishermen, Mr. Vega said, and made them reluctant to do their work.\n\nIt is now tuna season, he said, usually one of the most lucrative times for fishermen to head out. But fears of what might await them there has virtually ground fishing to a standstill, he added.\n\nGenevieve Glatsky and Simón Posada contributed reporting from Bogotá, Colombia.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/12/arts/podcast-sets-design.html","dateOfPublication":"2023-09-01","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00+08:00","title":"New Cultural Initiative Launched to Promote Community Engagement and Diversity","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new cultural initiative has been launched to promote cultural exchange and community engagement across various neighborhoods.

Trump, who was running for president at the time.\n\nThat revelation emerged from emails between Mr. Wolff and Mr. Epstein released by Washington lawmakers, shedding new light on the relationship between the two.\n\nIn one of the emails, from December 2015, Mr. Wolff said CNN planned to ask Mr. Trump about his relationship with Mr. Epstein, and then counseled Mr. Epstein on next steps.\n\n“I think you should let him hang himself,” Mr. Wolff wrote. “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.”\n\nIn October 2016, Mr. Wolff sent Mr. Epstein an email saying there was an “opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him.” The exchange came late in Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign, and weeks after a recording of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women to an “Access Hollywood” host emerged.\n\nBefore the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Wolff disclosed that he had interviewed Mr. Epstein “periodically” for his 2018 book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” which rocketed to the top of best-seller lists with its depiction of a chaotic White House and key officials criticizing the president.\n\nIn 2019, Mr. Epstein was charged in a federal indictment with sex trafficking of minors; he was subsequently found dead in a cell at a federal detention center in Manhattan. The authorities concluded that he had died by suicide. The case against Mr. Epstein, and the circumstances of his death, fueled years of speculation about his relations with top figures in American politics and business.\n\nGiven the public interest in Mr. Epstein, Mr. Wolff released tapes of his interviews with the convicted sex offender shortly before the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“I would say I had a dozen meetings, maybe a dozen and a half meetings, with various outlets, and everybody was interested — everybody was listening, there were a lot of executives in rooms or on Zoom calls — and then everybody passed,” Mr. Wolff said in an interview with James Surowiecki in The Yale Review.\n\nThe Daily Beast published an exclusive on the tapes.\n\nThe latest revelations speak to a well-established reality of recent decades: Journalists’ communications have a way of coming back to haunt them. WikiLeaks released hacked emails from Democratic operatives in 2016, bringing to light the transactional nature of high-profile Washington reporting. Texts and emails that surfaced in a voting company’s defamation suit against Fox News showed that high-ranking network officials disbelieved misinformation about the 2020 election that appeared on the cable channel.\n\nAlso included in the email release is correspondence between Mr. Epstein and Landon Thomas Jr., a New York Times reporter who left the paper in early 2019. A spokeswoman for The Times said Mr. Thomas had left the company “after editors discovered his failure to abide by our ethical standards.”\n\nMr. Thomas said in an interview on Wednesday that Mr. Epstein had been a “longstanding and very productive source” for him.\n\nIn Mr. Wolff’s case, the freshly released material suggests extraordinary coziness between journalist and source. “This is not his job,” said Edward Wasserman, a professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. “He’s becoming a participant, a player and a shaper of the news he’s going to report on.”\n\nMr. Wolff, 72, did not immediately respond to a requests for comment for this article. In comments to ABC News, he said that he couldn’t remember the specifics of the email exchange but that he had been having discussions with Mr. Epstein about his relationship with Mr. Trump. The goal, he said, was to get Mr. Epstein to go public with his comments about Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd in an Instagram post, Mr. Wolff acknowledged the emails between himself and Mr. Epstein and argued that the story of Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Epstein was “central to our time.” The pre-election release of his Epstein tapes, Mr. Wolff lamented in the post, had “little effect.”\n\nIn October, Mr. Wolff sued Melania Trump, whose counsel had sent Mr. Wolff a letter accusing him of defaming her and threatening legal action for more than $1 billion in damages.\n\n“Mrs. Trump’s claims are made for the purpose of harassing, intimidating, punishing or otherwise maliciously inhibiting Mr. Wolff’s free exercise of speech,” Mr. Wolff’s complaint noted. In his Instagram post on Wednesday, he said he thought his lawsuit would enable him to press both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Trump about Mr. Epstein.\n\nMr. Wolff has written several books on Mr. Trump and published his shorter fare in Vanity Fair, The Hollywood Reporter, New York magazine and other outlets. The often eyebrow-raising details in his reporting have long drawn criticism for his tactics. In a 2004 piece in The New Republic, Michelle Cottle wrote that “the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created — springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events.”\n\nHis “Fire and Fury” book in 2018 found an enormous audience among Mr. Trump’s detractors and fact checkers, who cited a number of errors in his reporting. Though some of the concerns were small, a bigger one emerged as Mr. Wolff made the promotional rounds on television.\n\nOn the HBO show “Real Time With Bill Maher,” Mr. Wolff said Mr. Trump was currently having an extramarital affair. Though he declined to name the paramour, he gave Mr. Maher’s audience a hint, saying the telling passage was toward the end of the book. “Now that I’ve told you, when you hit that paragraph, you’re going to say, ‘Bingo.’”\n\nMr. Wolff appeared to be referring to a portion of the book detailing the relationship between Mr. Trump and Nikki Haley, who was serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Haley denied having an affair with Mr. Trump and called the speculation “disgusting.”\n\nIn a 2019 interview with The Times, Mr. Wolff said: “As a journalist — or as a writer — my obligation is to come as close to the truth as I possibly can. And that’s not as close to someone else’s truth, but the truth as I see it.”\n\nJessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/kevin-roberts-heritage-foundation-nick-fuentes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:02:47-05:00","title":"Under Fire for Tucker Carlson Remarks, Think Tank Chief Pleads Ignorance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin D.

2025-11-13T05:03:59-05:00\n\nAfter it received a 218th signature on Wednesday night, a bipartisan effort to force the House to vote on a measure that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files advanced to the next stage.\n\nWith President Trump and House Republican leaders opposed, proponents had turned to an arcane procedural tactic, known as a discharge petition, which allows them to circumvent House leadership and bring bills onto the floor if a majority of members — 218 of them — sign on.\n\nWhen it became clear that they had succeeded, Speaker Mike Johnson, who had gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid a vote on such a measure, relented on Wednesday night and said he would bring the measure to a vote next week.\n\nHere’s how the process will work.\n\nThe House of Representatives operates by majority rule, but in practice, the speaker and the leaders of the majority party control how and whether bills move to the floor.\n\nNormally, when legislation is introduced, it gets referred to a House committee that is controlled by the majority. That committee is not required to act, and bills opposed by the leadership effectively die at this stage. A discharge petition is supposed to provide an end run around this problem. Its name comes from the act of discharging a bill from committee.\n\nIn this case, Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, were looking to force a vote on a bill that would require the Justice Department to release within 30 days material on its investigation into the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe lawmakers turned to a discharge petition after it became clear that Mr. Johnson would not bring the bill, which the White House has fought to kill, to the floor.\n\nMr. Massie and Mr. Khanna began collecting signatures in September. But their petition was only able to reach the 218-member threshold on Wednesday, when Representative Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, signed it just minutes after she was sworn into office.\n\nOnce 218 members have signed a discharge petition, the signatures are effectively frozen, and none can be removed. Mr. Trump spent the hours before the final signature feverishly lobbying Republican signatories to remove their names, including dispatching the attorney general and F.B.I. director to meet with Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, in the White House Situation Room. None budged.\n\nTypically, once it reaches 218 signatures, a discharge petition must “ripen” for seven legislative days — not calendar days, but the days when the House is in session and conducting legislative business. Then, a member can call up the measure on the floor, and the speaker must schedule it for a vote within the next two days.\n\nMr. Massie said on Wednesday night that he had checked with the House parliamentarian and learned that even if one of the members who signed the petition left Congress or died, their signature would still stand.\n\nThat question was particularly relevant because one signatory, Representative Mikie Sherrill, the New Jersey Democrat who was just elected governor of her state, said she would resign from the House next week, while the measure was expected to be ripening.\n\nBecause of the House’s schedule, which includes a weeklong Thanksgiving break, it initially appeared that the House would not vote on the Epstein measure until the first week of December. But the speaker said he would not wait that long.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Mr. Johnson said that he would speed up the timeline and schedule the Epstein vote next week rather than running down the procedural clock on the discharge petition.\n\nMr. Johnson continues to oppose the bill, arguing that it is unnecessary and that a separate investigation into Mr. Epstein by the House Oversight Committee is a more effective vehicle for transparency. As speaker, he could use procedural maneuvers to try and table the bill, as he did with an unrelated discharge petition earlier this year.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson had said that he would bring the measure to the floor if it got majority support, and his decision to move the vote up suggested he saw no reason to forestall the inevitable.\n\nIf every representative who signed the petition also votes for the Epstein measure, it would pass the House.\n\nIn fact, it is expected to draw even more votes than that. Republican leaders expect that some of their members who did not sign the discharge petition — which many lawmakers frown upon as an act of party disloyalty that undercuts their leaders — are likely to vote for the resolution itself. Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska already told reporters this week that he would support the measure, even though he did not join the effort to force a vote on it.\n\nIf the bill does pass the House, it will then be sent to the Senate, where it faces tough odds.\n\nThe Senate is under no obligation to take up bills sent by the House, and it would take 60 votes to force any action on the floor. Democrats hold 47 seats, and so even if they all backed the measure, they would still need 13 Republicans to buck Mr. Trump’s wishes and join them.\n\nIf the bill were to pass the Senate, it would be sent to the president’s desk, and he would be all but certain to veto it. Even if he did not, the only way to compel cooperation with such a measure would be for the House to enforce it by holding the attorney general in contempt of Congress, an exceedingly unlikely scenario.\n\nRepublicans were hoping to avoid a vote on the Epstein files because they did not want to be put in a politically difficult position. Mr. Trump has exhorted his supporters to move on from the Epstein investigation, and he has in the past several months called Republicans with continued concerns “stupid,” “foolish” and “very bad.”\n\nBut many of Mr. Trump’s right-wing supporters were primed to expect explosive revelations in the Epstein files by Mr. Trump and some of his top allies. They were outraged when the Justice Department closed an investigation on the matter in July without releasing all of its files, and have clamored for more information, flooding their members of Congress with phone calls, emails and social media posts pushing them to fight for more transparency.\n\nRepublicans did not want to find themselves in a political jam as they navigated those competing demands from the constituents who elected them and Mr. Trump, who is the leader of their party and wants to keep the matter closed.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/world/middleeast/israel-settlers-west-bank-mosque.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:33:57-05:00","title":"West Bank Mosque Burned as Israeli Settler Violence Surges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Extremist Israeli settlers burned a mosque in the West Bank, sparking outrage among Palestinian communities and raising alarm across international politics.

Struggled to Find Lawyers to Handle Maurene Comey Suit\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T10:14:09-05:00\n\nIn September, Maurene Comey, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor and a daughter of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, sued the Trump administration, accusing it of firing her without cause and asking to be reinstated.\n\nTwo months later, the Justice Department, hobbled by scores of resignations and firings and strained by a crisis in morale, has not responded to the lawsuit.\n\nThe department, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, has struggled to determine which of its offices and lawyers will handle Ms. Comey’s lawsuit, leading to the highly unusual lapse. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal Justice Department affairs.\n\nThe Manhattan prosecutor’s office where Ms. Comey was considered one of the top trial lawyers until her abrupt firing in July has indicated that it will not work on the case, the people said. Nor will the Brooklyn prosecutor’s office, they said. The Federal Programs Branch of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, which often handles high-profile litigation such as Ms. Comey’s lawsuit, will not handle the case, either.\n\nA spokesman for the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Spokesmen for the U.S. attorney’s offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn declined to comment.\n\nThe episode highlights how the Trump administration has struggled with the repercussions of its treatment of federal employees. The firing of Ms. Comey, a prosecutor who worked on cases against Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, was highly unusual, blindsiding even the leadership of her Manhattan office.\n\nIt is part of a pattern that has developed since President Trump has taken closer control of the Justice Department than any president in the past half-century. Mr. Trump has turned the department against his adversaries while simultaneously using his pardon power to reward his allies.\n\nThe lack of response from the Justice Department caused the Manhattan judge presiding over the case to issue an order on Nov. 3 postponing a hearing and laying out more precise steps to ensure a Justice Department response. The judge, Jesse M. Furman, directed that his order be “promptly” shared with whichever Justice Department office would ultimately handle the matter.\n\nAs Judge Furman noted, the defendants — including the U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi — have until Nov. 21 to respond.\n\nMr. Trump has long considered Ms. Comey’s father one of his foremost adversaries and has pushed a prosecution of Mr. Comey that is playing out in Virginia. On Thursday, Mr. Comey’s lawyers will present arguments challenging the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the U.S. attorney who secured charges against both of them.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Ms. Comey argued that the Trump administration was retaliating because of the president’s enmity toward her father, because of a perception of her politics or both. “No other plausible explanation exists for her termination,” her lawyers wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit noted that an independent agency known as the Merit Systems Protection Board would typically deal with complaints from a former federal employee. But, Ms. Comey said, the board had been unable to legally function after Mr. Trump fired a member in February, a year before her tenure was up.\n\nThe Manhattan federal prosecutor’s office recused itself from her case because of Ms. Comey’s deep connections there. Aside from Ms. Comey’s decade in the office, her husband was also a lawyer in the office’s civil division — the division of the office that would handle a lawsuit like Ms. Comey’s — until May.\n\nIn addition, Ellen Blain, one of Ms. Comey’s lawyers, was formerly an acting deputy chief of the civil division. Ms. Blain left the Manhattan office in 2024.\n\nOfficials in the Brooklyn office also decided they that they should keep the case at arm’s length. Two of the people with knowledge of the matter said that the Brooklyn and Manhattan offices had close connections, including personal ties among some of the lawyers and the fact that their investigations can be intertwined. Both offices work with the same F.B.I. squads, and as a high-ranking prosecutor in Manhattan, Ms. Comey would have, at times, coordinated with the Brooklyn office’s prosecutors.\n\nIt was unclear why the Federal Programs Branch is not handling the lawsuit. Ms. Comey is not seeking money other than back pay and reimbursement for her legal fees. But she asked the court to find that Mr. Trump had acted unconstitutionally, and to prevent the administration from any further retaliation.\n\nFormer prosecutors have said that under the Trump administration, entire U.S. attorney’s offices often seek to avoid cases altogether, in part because it is now more difficult for individual prosecutors within those offices to decline to handle certain matters. Traditionally, prosecutors could ask off a case with few repercussions, citing its subject matter, their personal conflicts or ethical concerns.\n\nBut early in the Trump administration, Ms. Bondi issued a memo requiring attorneys to do whatever was asked of them by supervisors, or risk discipline and firing. Thus, the easiest way to shield individual lawyers from the professional consequences of handling questionable cases is for an entire office to avoid handling a sensitive or high-profile matter.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/nyregion/skoufis-hochul-bills-veto.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:00:05Z","title":"Hochul Vetoed 7 of His Bills in a Single Day.

Could It Be Personal?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T03:00:05-05:00\n\nUpon first glance, the seven bills Gov. Kathy Hochul vetoed one Thursday in mid-October seemed to have little in common.\n\nOne would have required the state to respond more quickly to public records requests. Another would have forced grocery delivery services to be more transparent about pricing. A third would have made nursing homes designate specific storage spaces for deceased patients.\n\nBut one similarity quickly caught the eyes of Albany: All were sponsored by Senator James Skoufis, a moderate Democrat representing Rockland and Orange Counties.\n\nMr. Skoufis, 38, is an ambitious legislator who ran an unsuccessful campaign last year to lead the Democratic National Committee. He has never been shy about criticizing the governor.\n\nAfter a protracted budget battle last year, Mr. Skoufis gave a speech on the Senate floor blasting her approach as “authoritarian.” He later asserted that Ms. Hochul had “demonstrated an inability to be competent.”\n\nTensions between the two have only increased as Mr. Skoufis, who heads the Committee on Investigations and Government Operations, has led a high-profile inquiry into the government contractor Public Partnerships L.L.C., whose handling of a beloved $11 billion home care program has been dogged by controversy.\n\nThe debacle has been fodder for Ms. Hochul’s critics on both sides of the aisle, ahead of what is already shaping up to be an acerbic 2026 race for governor.\n\nRepresentatives for Ms. Hochul, also a Democrat, reject the notion that the vetoes were retaliatory, noting that while she had vetoed some of his bills, she had signed more than a dozen others.\n\n“All legislation is reviewed on its merits, and if Senator Skoufis is angry about vetoes, he could always focus on ensuring that his bills are practical, effective and achievable,” said a statement from Ms. Hochul’s press office.\n\nBut a person familiar with the governor’s thinking acknowledged that the packaging of the vetoes was intended to send a message to Mr. Skoufis that his behavior needed to be nipped in the bud. Ms. Hochul would not acknowledge any ulterior motivation recently when asked to comment.\n\n“I actually don’t pay attention to that man,” she said in an interview.\n\nMr. Skoufis also professed nonchalance regarding the governor’s vetoes.\n\n“When she comes after me, my numbers go up in my district,” Mr. Skoufis said in an interview, adding: “For someone who is so crazy about her own electoral politics next year, like, this is not helpful to her. But, weirdly, it’s helpful to me.”\n\nAt first glance, Ms. Hochul and Mr. Skoufis would seem to have a good deal in common. Both are moderates from the suburbs who have found themselves at odds with progressive Democratic colleagues over issues like bail reform and congestion pricing.\n\nBut Mr. Skoufis’s budget-related rebuke on the Senate floor earlier this year caught the attention of lawmakers unaccustomed to such public criticism of the governor from a fellow Democrat.\n\nA few months later, Mr. Skoufis’s committee announced it would hold a hearing to look into the contractor for the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program, or C.D.P.A.P.\n\nThe state had moved to consolidate the beloved but expensive program, which had relied upon hundreds of private administrators under a single entity, Public Partnerships L.L.C.\n\nBut the decision, which put hundreds of small administrators out of business, was divisive from the start, drawing protests from advocates, patients and the administrators, some of whom spent millions of dollars on ads opposing the move.\n\nPublic Partnership also struggled to take over the program, leading to delayed and missing payments and an overwhelmed staff. Ms. Hochul’s political rivals from New York to Washington were quick to seize upon the troubled rollout.\n\nIn August, Mr. Skoufis all but accused the Hochul administration of rigging the bid, citing a piece of draft legislation that had named Public Partnerships as the program administrator months before the state began soliciting bids.\n\nDuring a hearing, the company testified that it had not been in touch with the executive chamber before the contract was awarded. But in a follow-up letter, it reversed course, admitting that there had, in fact, been contact.\n\nThe Hochul administration has rejected accusations of bid-rigging and said “it makes no sense for Senator Skoufis to keep attacking the governor for her effective work to rescue C.D.P.A.P. from a fiscal crisis, protect home care for the people who rely on it, and save hundreds of millions of dollars per year for taxpayers.”\n\nIn October, an appeals court judge handling a case between the former administrators and the state said it had found no evidence of bid rigging.\n\nMr. Skoufis’s committee pressed on, issuing a series of document requests to Public Partnerships and the New York Department of Health, under threat of subpoena.\n\nA week after the first round of vetoes, Ms. Hochul quashed two more of Mr. Skoufis’s bills, including one that would have incentivized pharmacists to dispense contraception over the counter by raising reimbursements from insurance companies.\n\nIn her veto message, Ms. Hochul stressed her commitment to reproductive rights, but said that insurance companies were already required to cover contraception, and that increasing reimbursements would only lead to higher premiums for consumers.\n\nMr. Skoufis disagreed, accusing Ms. Hochul of sacrificing “reproductive health access at the altar of a grudge.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/nyregion/subway-train-conductors-hochul.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"03:00:11-05:00","title":"Does the Subway Still Need Train Conductors?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The New York City subway is facing a pivotal policy decision regarding the long-standing requirement of a two-person crew, with Governor Kathy Hochul set to decide by the end of 2025 whether to extend the rule.

Train Conductors?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T03:00:11-05:00\n\nFor more than a century, nearly every New York City subway train has had at least a two-person crew: an operator, who drives the train, and a conductor, who controls the doors and makes announcements.\n\nSupporters of the practice say that a second pair of eyes on the train helps keep passengers safe. But many transit advocates argue that the custom is unnecessary, costly and impedes faster service.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul must decide by the end of the year whether to sign a law that would extend the two-person requirement indefinitely, at a time when most of the world’s major train lines have already moved to one-person operation, or even full automation, according to a new study.\n\nIn a review of more than 400 train lines in over a dozen countries, just 6 percent of the routes still required two-person crews, according to a report released Thursday by New York University’s Marron Institute of Urban Management, a civic think tank.\n\nThe analysis studied train lines in Europe, Asia and North America, including systems that surpass New York City’s subway in size and ridership, said Eric Goldwyn, a program director at the Marron Institute and co-author of the report.\n\n“We don’t want to lock in old technology, old practices and more expensive operating costs,” Mr. Goldwyn said. The issue came to a head in July, when a bill that would require a conductor on practically all subway trains passed in the New York State legislature. A version of the bill, which effectively bans one-person train operation, has been pushed by transit labor leaders for decades.\n\nMs. Hochul, whose office controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the subway, must either approve, veto, or amend the bill by the end of the year. Sean Butler, a spokesman for the governor, said only that “she will review the legislation.”\n\nMs. Hochul is up for re-election next year, and union support, including from transit labor leaders, is likely to be an important consideration.\n\nThe M.T.A. declined to comment.\n\nJohn Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, which represents subway conductors, said two-person crews are a deterrent to crime and a necessity when trains need to be evacuated.\n\n“It doesn’t really matter to us what the data shows,” Mr. Samuelsen said about the report, adding that the presence of a conductor makes trips “visibly safer.”\n\nSupporters of one-person train operation argue that reducing the number of crew members would free up money for more frequent service on several routes. But Mr. Samuelsen said he was skeptical of that claim, because there is no guarantee that any savings would be reinvested in service.\n\nThere are roughly 3,600 subway train conductors, who are paid an average of $38 an hour, according to M.T.A. data.\n\nJoseph Addabbo Jr., a state senator who cosponsored the bill, said that concerns about requiring a conductor on trains are outweighed by the safety and customer service benefits when a second crew member is on board.\n\n“Physical presence helps,” he said.\n\nStill, the M.T.A. spends more on labor than nearly any other expense — about two-thirds of its annual operating budget of roughly $20 billion — at a time when the agency could soon face a fiscal gap, according to the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group.\n\nAndrew Rein, the president of the group, said the M.T.A. could face an $800 million cash shortfall starting in 2030. If the transit authority transitioned to one-person train operation, it could save over $440 million a year, as more conductors retire or shift to different jobs. Those savings could help plug the budget hole, or pay for more frequent train service on upgraded lines, he said.\n\nA small number of shuttle trains and shorter lines already operate without a conductor, at least part of the time. The bill, as written, would force the M.T.A. to hire a second crew member for those trains, which could cost about an extra $10 million a year, Mr. Rein said.\n\nThe M.T.A. has already invested heavily in a new signal system, called communications-based train control, or C.B.T.C., which is designed to control trains remotely and allow more frequent service. In April, the state approved $5.4 billion to be spent on the system, and billions more are expected to be raised through congestion pricing toll revenue. The 7 and L trains have already completed the upgrades.\n\nBut if the bill is passed, the M.T.A. would be prohibited from shifting to one-person operation on those and other trains, said Rachael Fauss, senior policy adviser at Reinvent Albany, a good governance group.\n\n“It’s kind of flushing the benefits of C.B.T.C. down the toilet,” she said.\n\nThe bill could also affect plans for future train lines, like the Interborough Express, or IBX, a proposed light-rail service that would run between Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nBlair Lorenzo, the executive director of the Effective Transit Alliance, an advocacy group, said the IBX could be fully automated, similar to the driverless AirTrain that connects public transit hubs to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Such a move could allow the train to run more frequently, she said.\n\n“The less time you spend waiting for a train,\" she said, “the happier people are.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/nyregion/new-jersey-sports-gambling-mob.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:32:19-05:00","title":"New Jersey Accuses Mob-Led Ring of Running Illegal Sports Gambling","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New Jersey law enforcement has accused Joseph M.

It could pull back, concede defeat and save lives. Or it could fight on, delaying a symbolic and tactical victory for Moscow but risking heavier losses of its own.\n\nIt’s a dilemma that has haunted the Ukrainian military throughout the war, as it has struggled to contain Russian advances. Ukraine chose to hold on amid grinding battles in cities like Bakhmut and Avdiivka, both of which ultimately fell to Moscow. Critics argued that a timely retreat could have saved soldiers, Kyiv’s most precious resource in a war of attrition against a much larger adversary.\n\nUkraine’s argument for holding cities as long as possible is that it forces the Russian Army to expend vast numbers of troops, leaving it weakened in the battles to come. There is also a political element, as the two sides wage a battle of narratives. Kyiv wants to prevent Moscow from claiming successes that could sap morale at home and that the Kremlin could use to persuade the Trump administration that supporting Ukraine is a losing wager.\n\nBut with parts of Pokrovsk under Russian control and an adjacent city, Myrnohrad, facing the threat of encirclement, military analysts and some Ukrainian commanders worry that Kyiv may now be repeating past mistakes by staying weeks or months longer than necessary.\n\n“Ukraine has previously held certain positions and cities for too long after the conditions became unfavorable,” said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, who recently visited the front line.\n\nPokrovsk, with a prewar population of 60,000, would be the largest Ukrainian city to fall since Bakhmut in May 2023. Its capture would give Russia a platform to push north and pursue its stated goal of capturing the Donetsk region, about three-quarters of which it already controls.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the difficult situation around Pokrovsk, saying that Ukrainian forces are badly outnumbered. But he has shown no sign of preparing to order a retreat. Instead, he visited Ukrainian troops near Pokrovsk last week and discussed their needs in defending the area.\n\nIf Ukraine keeps fighting for Pokrovsk, it risks being drawn into protracted urban combat as Russia continues to pour its superior resources into the battle. While Moscow has proved capable of replacing its losses through regular army recruitment campaigns offering sizable payouts, Ukraine has long struggled with troop shortages.\n\nVyacheslav Shevchuk, a drone battalion commander in Ukraine’s 68th Separate Jaeger Brigade, who fights in Pokrovsk, said the Ukrainian military was ill-suited for urban combat. It lacks soldiers to clear enemy positions, he said, and cannot use its drones as efficiently in built-up areas that provide concealment for Russian troops. Ukraine is also vulnerable to Russia’s use of heavy guided bombs to smash its defenses.\n\n“It seems to me that the fate of this city is already decided,” Mr. Shevchuk said. “We must take care of our soldiers and withdraw them in time. I see nothing wrong or shameful in pulling our positions back to more advantageous locations.”\n\nPokrovsk and Myrnohrad have long stood as bulwarks against Russian advances in Donetsk. Moscow’s forces began attacking the cities more than a year ago but were held back by Ukraine’s fortified defenses and extensive use of drones to detect and counter incoming attacks.\n\nStill, repeated assaults wore down Ukrainian defenses, and Russian forces now increasingly rely on small assault groups to slip through undermanned Ukrainian lines undetected. They have also exploited recent poor weather, which hampers Ukrainian reconnaissance drones, to push into the city.\n\nIn a video that circulated widely on social media this week, Russian troops entered Pokrovsk from the south, along a road shrouded in fog. The footage, whose location was verified by The New York Times, showed a ragtag column of soldiers on motorcycles and on top of cars, some missing doors. They drove down the road seemingly unopposed.\n\nWhether Ukraine can pin these troops in street fighting in Pokrovsk for an extended period and bleed Russia’s army remains unclear.\n\nIn Bakhmut, fierce combat raged for months over every street and block, leaving the city in ruins.\n\nThe Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank, said in a report last year that holding Bakhmut made sense initially, as it allowed Kyiv to “inflict disproportionate losses” on Russian forces.\n\nBut after Russians advanced far enough to bring Ukrainian supply routes into the city within reach of their artillery, “the disparity in losses became unfavorable for Ukraine,” the report said. Still, Ukraine’s top command decided to hold on so as not to signal weakness, just as it was trying to secure more military aid from Western partners.\n\nOverall, some 10,000 Ukrainian troops were killed or severely wounded in Bakhmut, while Russia suffered four times as many casualties, the report said. The bulk of the Russian force there were convicted criminals recruited from jails by the Wagner paramilitary group, making it significantly easier for the Kremlin to absorb many deaths without stoking discontent at home.\n\nThe report said the best course for Ukraine “would have been to withdraw to a new defense line.”\n\nBy late 2023, the focus of the war had shifted to Avdiivka, a heavily fortified Ukrainian town south of Bakhmut. Russia is believed to have suffered even more deaths there than in Bakhmut — at least 20,000, according to a statistical analysis, based on Russian court data, by the independent news outlets Mediazona and Meduza.\n\nRussian forces pressed on despite the losses. Unlike in Bakhmut, they did not enter the city frontally but gradually moved to encircle it, trying to force a Ukrainian retreat. Moscow would later use that tactic in other eastern Ukrainian strongholds such as Vuhledar.\n\nUkraine kept its forces in Avdiivka even as the Russian noose drew tighter. As the battle came to a close in February 2024, Ukrainian soldiers had to exit through a corridor roughly a mile wide, under heavy enemy fire. Hundreds may have been captured or gone missing during the chaotic last-minute retreat.\n\nThere is now fear that a similar scenario may unfold in Myrnohrad, just east of Pokrovsk.\n\nBuilding on their advance in Pokrovsk and progress to the north, Russian forces have created pincers around Myrnohrad, leaving a corridor less than two miles wide for troops to exit, according to a map by DeepState, a Ukrainian group monitoring battlefield developments. Bohdan Yanush, a deputy battalion commander in Ukraine’s 79th Air Assault Brigade, said several hundred Ukrainian soldiers were most likely still fighting in the pocket.\n\nMr. Yanush said he was concerned about a possible encirclement, but he and other commanders in the area said there was none for now. Some roads into the city remain usable, soldiers said, and the same fog that helped Russian troops move into Pokrovsk has allowed Ukraine to rotate soldiers into the Myrnohrad pocket.\n\n“Reserves are working, the command is reacting and we see that the line holds,” said Oleksandr Bannikov, a sergeant with Ukraine’s 38th Marine Brigade.\n\nUkrainian soldiers fighting in Myrnohrad said that they had received no orders to retreat, and that they were focused on inflicting as many casualties on attacking Russian troops as they could.\n\nThe question, as in Bakhmut and Avdiivka, is when the attrition balance will turn against Ukraine and whether Kyiv will then decide to concede defeat.\n\nThe relentless Russian assaults have opened gaps along the front that Moscow has exploited to push forward. In recent days, Russian troops have captured half a dozen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region, southwest of Pokrovsk, in an unusually rapid advance.\n\nIf troops are not withdrawn from Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, “we could end up in a situation where there is no one to plug the gap in the front,” Vitaliy Deinega, the founder of Come Back Alive, a major Ukrainian charity that supports the military, wrote on Facebook. In that case, “the fortifications we have dug in our rear will quickly fall into enemy hands,” he said.\n\nAnatoly Kurmanaev, Kim Barker and Arijeta Lajka contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/world/asia/pakistan-trump-lobbying.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:21-05:00","title":"How Pakistan’s Spending Blitz Helped Win Over Trump and Flip U.S. Policy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, Pakistan launched a high-stakes lobbying campaign in Washington by spending millions on contracts with firms linked to former Trump administration figures, including George Sorial and Keith Schiller.

2025-11-13T05:00:21-05:00\n\nPakistan signed a series of high-priced contracts with prominent Washington lobbying firms this spring, just weeks before the White House announced favorable new policies that gave the country one of the world’s more enviable tariff rates and an edge over its archrival, India.\n\nThe policy changes heralded a turnabout in Pakistan’s previously rocky relationship with the Trump administration and have largely been attributed to shrewd diplomacy by Islamabad, which has lavished President Trump with the kind of public accolades and big-ticket business deals he relishes.\n\nBut the lobbying contracts, which totaled millions of dollars and held out the promises of lower tariffs and access to Mr. Trump, suggest an additional reason for Pakistan’s improved standing: a campaign to influence the president, which included employing some of his closest confidants.\n\nIn April and May, as Pakistan ramped up its charm offensive, it spent at least three times as much as India on lobbying in Washington, according to contracts filed with the Department of Justice. As Islamabad rapidly hired lobbyists, including Mr. Trump’s former business partners and bodyguard, its relationship with the United States blossomed and India’s deteriorated.\n\nMany factors may help explain India and Pakistan’s recent divergent trajectories. One is that Pakistan agreed to credit Mr. Trump with ending its military dispute with India in May and to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India refused to do either, arguing that U.S. involvement had nothing to do with the cease-fire. Islamabad also eagerly pitched what became a $500 million mineral extraction agreement and opened its markets to American farm goods.\n\nBut the timeline of events and the speedy U.S. warming toward Pakistan also coincides with the lobbying effort.\n\n“You can sort of look at the dots connecting themselves,” said Michael Kugelman, formerly the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, who added that Pakistan’s lobbying effort was one of several key factors in its turnaround.\n\n“There were lobbyists charged with dealing with the tariff issue, then Pakistan’s tariffs come down,” he added. “There are lobbyists contracted to promote economic cooperation, then you have all this interest from the U.S. in critical minerals and energy.”\n\nOver the course of a turbulent few weeks this spring, as the Trump administration raised tariffs on countries around the world and Pakistan found itself on the brink of war with India, Islamabad entered contracts with six Washington firms for nearly $5 million in eventual retainer fees.\n\nAmong the firms Pakistan hired was Seiden Law LLP, which subcontracted Javelin Advisors, a government relations venture. Javelin’s founders include George Sorial, a longtime Trump Organization executive, and Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s former bodyguard, who served as director of Oval Office operations during the first Trump administration.\n\nA million-dollar contract signed between Pakistan and Seiden Law on April 8 promised “a mutually agreed upon number of meetings to enhance Pakistani-U.S. leadership level engagements at the White House.”\n\nAnother agreement with Javelin was inked on April 24, just two days after militants killed 26 people in a terrorist attack in India-controlled Kashmir, and Pakistan and India found themselves on a path to war.\n\nJust weeks after the contracts were finalized, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, the senior-most leader in Pakistan’s powerful military, arrived in Washington, where he met the Javelin principals.\n\nThe following afternoon, June 18, Field Marshal Munir had a private lunch with Mr. Trump at the White House. It was a remarkable meeting: Pakistani Army chiefs had accompanied civilian leaders to presidential meetings, but there is no record of one meeting on his own with a president at the White House.\n\n“We realized we needed to establish a channel at the most senior level,” Mr. Seiden said. Citing attorney-client privilege, he declined to discuss the details of the sit-down with the field marshal, but in a statement his firm said the Pakistanis credited it with its improved fortunes in Washington.\n\n“Many people were instrumental in this that didn’t involve us,” Javelin Advisors said in a statement to The New York Times. “The Pakistani personnel told us we were instrumental in the progress made with the U.S. government.”\n\nAn official familiar with the discussions said Javelin approached one of the president’s aides to facilitate a meeting, but the lunch was ultimately organized by the National Security Council.\n\nPakistani Embassy officials did not respond to requests for comment about efforts to improve their relationship with the White House.\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that Pakistan has been a “vital partner” in countering “radical Islamic terrorism” since the start of the administration. Mr. Trump’s use of tariffs to “end the conflict between India and Pakistan,” she added, “enhanced the president’s positive relationship with Pakistani leaders.”\n\nBy the fall, Mr. Trump had called Pakistan’s army chief his “favorite field marshal” and the nation’s support for his Gaza peace plan “incredible.” It was a sharp turn for a country that Mr. Trump had said in his first term offered “nothing but lies and deceit.”\n\nOn April 2, President Trump announced a 29 percent tariff on Pakistani goods. Six days later — the same day it hired Seiden Law — Islamabad signed a deal with Orchid Advisors, a lobbying firm, which then subcontracted with the firm Squire Patton Boggs.\n\nThe contract with Orchid promised “direct advocacy efforts with the Trump administration regarding tariffs and trade” and to “reset the diplomatic, military and commercial relationship” between the countries.\n\nSquire has employed the president’s former economic adviser Everett Eissenstat, and his former defense secretary, Mark Esper.\n\nFour months after the contract was signed,   Mr. Trump cut tariffs on Pakistan to 19 percent — one of the lower rates among major Asia economies — and increased India’s rate to 50 percent, in large part over President Trump’s frustration that it was still buying Russian oil.\n\nIn a statement, Squire said it “cannot comment on client engagements without their permission.”\n\nForeign governments paying American lobbyists to influence public officials is nothing new. Since 1938, the Foreign Agents Registration Act has compelled Americans working on behalf of foreign governments to register with the Department of Justice and publicly disclose contracts signed with them.\n\nBut at the same time that Pakistan was ramping up its campaign, the Trump administration was moving to loosen limits on foreign lobbying.Recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi, herself a former lobbyist, disbanded the Justice Department’s Foreign Influence Task Force, which prosecuted cases of influence peddling, and narrowed the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nIndia also hired new lobbyists in the spring, and ramped up its efforts in the summer as it was being outspent in Washington by Pakistan.\n\nIn April, India inked a deal with SHW Partners LLC, run by the longtime Trump adviser Jason Miller, who worked on all three of the president’s campaigns. That contract promised India “strategic counsel” and help building “government relations,” but does not specify particular areas.\n\nAnd in August, India hired Mercury Public Affairs, whose partners include Danielle Alvarez, a former senior adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign, and Bryan Lanza, the former communications director for Mr. Trump’s transition team. Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, was also formerly employed by the firm as a lobbyist.\n\nThe Indian Embassy did not respond to a request to comment.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/opinion/trump-comey-james-maurene.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:03:37-05:00","title":"Trump v.

James and Maurene Comey\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:03:37-05:00\n\nThe government of North Korea practices “kin punishment,” which means that the state penalizes those who commit political offenses and their relatives as well. With at least one prominent family, the Trump administration has apparently adopted a similar model.\n\nIn a pretrial hearing scheduled for Thursday in Alexandria, Va., James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, will challenge the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the federal prosecutor who signed his indictment in September. Mr. Comey is the first former senior official to face criminal prosecution by the Trump administration, but the case against him turns on the application of well-established legal principles. Are the charges vindictive? Does the indictment clearly specify criminal acts? Did Mr. Comey, in fact, give false testimony? The outcome of the prosecution will resonate widely, but only Mr. Comey will experience the consequences of the verdict.\n\nMaurene Comey, his eldest daughter, was fired July 16 by the Justice Department from her position as a career federal prosecutor, and she, in turn, sued to get her job back. Pretrial proceedings in her civil case are now underway in the same New York courthouse where Ms. Comey used to represent the government.\n\nBoth cases are potential landmarks in the history of American justice, but the legal precedent established by the daughter’s case may turn out to be far more consequential than the finding in her father’s. The resolution of Ms. Comey’s challenge to her dismissal could affect the legal rights of nearly all federal employees.\n\nMs. Comey’s claim is straightforward. She spent a decade as an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. In that role, she enjoyed the protections of the federal Civil Service, which has been in existence for more than a century.\n\nAccording to the latest version of the law, passed in 1978, employees are entitled to “fair and equitable treatment … without regard to political affiliation … and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights,” and personnel actions (including firings) must be based on merit and fitness, and must not be arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. According to her legal claim, Ms. Comey was fired in violation of these provisions.\n\nHer lawsuit is a nearly perfect test case, because she had an impeccable record as a prosecutor. Through her decade of service, she received consistently “outstanding” performance reviews, and she was promoted to leadership positions within the Southern District office. She handled some of the department’s highest-profile cases, including the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, for sex trafficking, before his suicide and she later successfully prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell. Shortly before she was fired, she was part of the team that won only a partial conviction of Sean “Diddy” Combs for various sex-related offenses. Ms. Comey has maintained that there was never any allegation, much less proof, offered to her that her performance was deficient.\n\nSo why was she fired? Throughout 2025, Ms. Comey was a target of Laura Loomer, the right-wing social media influencer whose public denunciations of several members of the Trump administration, including Gen. Timothy Haugh, director of the National Security Agency, led to their dismissals. Ms. Loomer has positioned herself as the president’s protector and uses her presence on social media to lead the charge against those she accuses of insufficient loyalty to the commander in chief. Ms. Loomer called for Ms. Comey to be fired as a “national security risk” because of her “proximity to a criminal,” that is, her father.\n\nThe formal notice of Ms. Comey’s dismissal, which came in a brief email from a Justice Department official in Washington, gave no reason for her termination. Rather, she was told only that she was being fired “pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution,” the provision that defines the powers of the president. Those brief words — and notably what the firing message omitted — reveal the legal stakes of Ms. Comey’s lawsuit.\n\nThe president has the absolute right to fire political appointees, like cabinet members and other senior officials in his administration. But the vast majority of federal employees, including line prosecutors like Ms. Comey, have been protected by the Civil Service rules, and that’s what the Justice Department didn’t address in the email informing her of her dismissal.\n\n“Ms. Comey has a very good case that she was fired in violation of the Civil Service act, which says you have to be fired for cause, and they have stated no cause for firing her,” said Richard Pierce Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, who is an authority on Civil Service law.\n\nCivil Service has deep roots in American government. “The fight over the ‘spoils system’ defined American politics in the late 19th century,” said Daniel Carpenter, a professor of government at Harvard. “When Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, defeated Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, in 1888, the first thing Harrison did was fire 40,000 postal workers so he could replace them with Republicans. The entire system was inefficient and corrupt.”\n\nThe Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was intended to establish job qualification, rather than political affiliation, as the primary criterion for federal employment, but the law wasn’t widely carried out until the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, in the Progressive Era heyday of the early 20th century. “The idea was to move most federal jobs to a merit system, and to outlaw politically based firings by a new administration in town,” Professor Carpenter said. With various tweaks, as in the 1978 law, the Civil Service remained largely politically untouchable, until now.\n\nJudicial recognition of presidents’ constitutional right to fire federal employees without giving a reason, and in plain violation of Civil Service rules, would be an enormous expansion of executive power. That’s what President Trump has attempted to do in a number of areas, including tariffs, immigration and war powers — all according to a theory of constitutional law known as the unitary executive.\n\nIn this term, the Supreme Court will be testing the limits of this theory when it considers whether Mr. Trump has the right to fire the leaders of purportedly independent agencies, like the Federal Reserve, before the end of their fixed terms. Ms. Comey’s case raises a further question about the extension of executive power: whether the president can also fire — for any reason or no reason — hundreds of thousands of other federal employees.\n\nThere’s already one sign of the priority that Mr. Trump assigns to his claim that he can fire any federal employee. The leading academic spokesperson for the idea that the Constitution gives the president nearly unfettered authority over the federal work force was a law professor at Catholic University of America named Jennifer Mascott, and Mr. Trump rewarded her for her views with a nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. She was confirmed by the Senate last month. Neither Comeys’ case will be appealed to the Third Circuit, but the elevation of such a prominent voice for presidential power over federal employment may reverberate throughout the federal judiciary.\n\nThanks to Civil Service laws, most federal employees were able to believe that they served outside the churn of electoral politics and that their work would continue seamlessly from one administration to the next. That insulation from partisan upheaval is often a major attraction for people like Ms. Comey, who was aptly described by her lawyers as “an exemplary, dedicated and highly decorated public servant.”\n\nThe greatest risk of putting the tenure of all federal employees at the whim of the president is not that he will fire them all; it’s that people like Ms. Comey will not seek out the work in the first place.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Councilman Joins Packed Race to Succeed Nadler\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T07:00:05-05:00\n\nErik Bottcher, a Democratic city councilman from downtown Manhattan, said on Thursday that he would run to succeed Representative Jerrold Nadler in a coveted New York City House seat.\n\nMr. Bottcher joins an increasingly crowded primary field that already includes a Kennedy scion, a Nadler protégé, a tech-focused state assemblyman and a 26-year-old upstart. More potential candidates are still circling.\n\nLike most of them, Mr. Bottcher, 46, is a staunch liberal. He has called President Trump an “autocratic” leader, denounced New York’s spiraling living costs and vocally supported Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nBut in an interview, Mr. Bottcher argued that his experiences as a gay man and L.G.B.T.Q. rights activist had made him prepared to face a fractious moment in American politics in ways his rivals were not.\n\n“I have faced down right-wing extremists right here in Manhattan,” he said, referring to a 2022 episode in which he was targeted for supporting Drag Story Hour events at local libraries.\n\n“They invaded my home, they vandalized my office, two of them were arrested in the lobby of my building, a third was arrested for assaulting one of my neighbors,” said Mr. Bottcher, who lives in Chelsea. “We did not back down, we stood up, and we held them accountable.”\n\nMr. Nadler, 78, a giant of Manhattan politics, stunned colleagues in September when he announced he would not seek re-election after three decades in Congress. He said the time had come for generational change.\n\nYoung candidates have heeded that call in growing numbers ahead of a Democratic primary next June. So far, they include Jack Schlossberg, 32, who also lives in Chelsea and is the grandson of John F. Kennedy; Micah Lasher, 43, a state assemblyman and Nadler protégé from the West Side; Alex Bores, 35, a state assemblyman from the East Side; and Liam Elkind, 26, a nonprofit founder. Also running are Alan Pardee, 58, a former financial executive; and Jami Floyd, 61, a journalist and lawyer.\n\nStretching the width of Manhattan from 14th Street to near the top of Central Park, New York’s 12th District is home to more Fortune 500 companies, millionaires and cultural landmarks than perhaps any other House seat in the country. It is safely Democratic, but its residents split their votes almost evenly in last week’s mayoral election between Mr. Mamdani and the more moderate former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\n\nIn a video announcing his candidacy set to be released on Wednesday, Mr. Bottcher uses his experience as a closeted gay child growing up in the Adirondacks to frame his run. At 15, he attempted suicide and spent a month in a psychiatric treatment facility. He said his time in treatment saved him and would not have been possible without health insurance.\n\n“That was really the beginning of my political awakening, but it’s also a reason why mental health is one of my signature issues,” he said in the interview.\n\nMr. Bottcher joined the City Council as a staff member in 2009, serving as a liaison to L.G.B.T.Q. New Yorkers and those with H.I.V. He worked as an aide to Mr. Cuomo when the former governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, before returning to the Council as the chief of staff to Corey Johnson, his predecessor as the council member for Chelsea.\n\nMr. Bottcher was then elected to the Council himself in 2021, and represents a district that includes Greenwich Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.\n\nHe plans to campaign for Congress on legislation he passed expanding mental health services in city homeless shelters and his support for projects slated to build thousands of units of affordable housing (though sometimes at great cost to the city).\n\nMr. Bottcher backed Mr. Mamdani during the mayor’s race, and said he was impressed by how he brought out record numbers of young voters in a municipal election.\n\n“The Democratic Party will ignore that at its own peril,” Mr. Bottcher said.\n\nStill, the councilman detailed several areas of disagreement with the incoming mayor. He said he supported Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, while Mr. Mamdani believes it should be structured as a state with equal rights for people of all religions.\n\nAnd while the councilman he supports Mr. Mamdani’s call for a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments, Mr. Bottcher said he would like to see the mayor-elect “put a larger emphasis” on building new housing.\n\nAsked about Mr. Schlossberg, a political neophyte with a famous family name who entered the race for the 12th District earlier this week, Mr. Bottcher declined to criticize him.\n\n“The power of celebrity is real,” he said. “But what’s even more powerful is many, many years of working on the ground in our communities doing the hard work side by side with neighborhood activists.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/science/blue-origin-launch-rocket.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:12:23-05:00","title":"Blue Origin to Launch NASA’s ESCAPADE Mission to Mars: How to Watch","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Blue Origin is attempting to launch NASA’s ESCAPADE mission on its New Glenn rocket, aiming to study Mars’s magnetic field and atmosphere using two spacecraft named Blue and Gold.

orbital rocket built by Blue Origin, the space company founded by Jeff Bezos, is still on a launchpad in Florida after postponed launch attempts on Sunday and Wednesday. The rocket is ready for its second mission.\n\nTucked inside the rocket is NASA’s ESCAPADE mission — two identical spacecraft that will orbit Mars to measure the dynamics of that planet’s magnetic field and atmosphere.\n\nBut that is only one goal for the launch. Blue Origin will attempt on Thursday to land the rocket’s booster stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic, a feat that only Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX, has so far achieved.\n\nLiftoff from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida is scheduled for Thursday afternoon during an 88-minute launch window that begins at 2:57 p.m. Eastern and ends at 4:25 p.m.\n\nBlue Origin is providing online coverage of the launch, starting 20 minutes before liftoff.\n\nSunday’s launch was postponed because of poor weather over the launchpad, and then Wednesday’s flight was called off.\n\nOn Wednesday, the weather cleared. The rocket was ready, as was ESCAPADE.\n\nThen space weather intervened.\n\nOn Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, the sun shot off three coronal mass ejections — gargantuan belches of high-speed charged particles — that headed in the direction of the Earth. Two of those merged and slammed into Earth’s magnetic field on Tuesday, generating colorful light shows in the night sky.\n\nThe energetic particles also wreak havoc on electronics.\n\nThe radiation from Tuesday’s bombardment was beginning to die down, and the launch would have gone ahead, said Rob Lillis, the principal investigator for ESCAPADE.\n\nBut then came word that the third mass coronal ejection would strike at the time that ESCAPADE was heading out on its own.\n\nThe key worry was that the geomagnetic storm would crash the computers of the spacecraft, preventing the solar arrays from deploying and killing the spacecraft.\n\nThat third coronal mass ejection turned out not to be a monster, but there was no way to know that ahead of time.\n\nAt 321 feet tall, New Glenn is a giant. It is taller than the Falcon 9 rockets regularly flown by SpaceX, but shorter than the Starship vehicle the company is testing in Texas.\n\nThe rocket is named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth.\n\nIts payload nose cone, at seven meters wide, offers at least twice as much space for payloads as other rockets currently in operation.\n\nThe booster stage — the lower part of the rocket that lifts off the ground and carries the upper stage through the densest part of the atmosphere — is designed to land and to be reused.\n\nAfter it propels the rocket up through the dense, lower part of the atmosphere, the giant New Glenn booster stage will drop away and try to set down on a floating platform named Jacklyn, after Mr. Bezos’ mother.\n\nThat boat is already positioned about 375 miles off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nYes, SpaceX regularly recovers the booster stages of its Falcon 9 rockets, then reflies them, a feat it first accomplished a decade ago. Since then, SpaceX has successfully landed the boosters more than 500 times. One of its boosters has flown 31 times.\n\nNo other company has landed a stage of an orbital-class rocket. Blue Origin does land and reuse the boosters of its much smaller New Shepard rockets, which send tourists and science experiments on up-and-down, suborbital flights to the edge of space, but not to orbit. Reusing the booster stage of New Glenn will be key to speeding the pace of launches if Blue Origin is to become a serious competitor to SpaceX.\n\nIn the near future, a Chinese company, Landspace, is also aiming to land the booster of its new Zhuque-3 rocket, which, at first glance, looks like a clone of the Falcon 9.\n\nThis rocket is carrying ESCAPADE, or Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers, a NASA-financed mission developed by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. The mission consists of two identical spacecraft named Blue and Gold — the school colors of Berkeley.\n\nThe two spacecraft will take a long, slow trip to Mars, arriving in September 2027. After they reach their destination, Blue and Gold will spend at least a year orbiting the red planet to take measurements of the magnetic field around it, as well as the dance of charged particles in the thin atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket is also carrying a NASA communications technology demonstration from the company Viasat.\n\nESCAPADE was originally scheduled to launch on the first New Glenn mission in October 2024. However, when it appeared that New Glenn would not be ready in time, NASA decided to pull the mission off that flight and put the spacecraft into storage.\n\nThe first New Glenn finally launched in January, and its primary mission was a success. The payload — a demonstration of Blue Ring, a technology that Blue Origin is developing to move payloads around in space — made it to orbit and successfully completed its tests.\n\nBut the secondary goal of landing the booster was not successful. The booster’s engines failed to reignite as it re-entered the atmosphere, and it crashed into the Atlantic instead of landing on the Jacklyn floating platform.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/opinion/trump-pardons-crimes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:04:02-05:00","title":"Pardon Me.

I Am Not Done Committing Crimes.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:04:02-05:00\n\nLet me tell you about four very different men who share something quite important in common.\n\nOn Monday, a man named Jonathan Braun was sentenced to 27 months in prison. The charges against him included sexually assaulting the live-in nanny for his own children and attacking a nurse with an IV pole. He was also accused of assaulting a 3-year-old child.\n\nIn October, a man named Christopher Moynihan was arrested and charged with threatening via text to “eliminate” Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, at a speaking engagement in New York City on Oct. 20.\n\nIn March, a federal jury convicted a man named Eliyahu Weinstein of defrauding investors of $41 million. As Bloomberg reported, he had falsely promised “to invest their money in Covid-19 masks, scarce baby formula and first-aid kits bound for Ukraine.”\n\nIn January, an Indiana sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a man named Matthew Huttle when he reportedly raised a firearm during a traffic stop. Huttle was being arrested for a felony traffic violation when he resisted arrest. A special prosecutor charged with investigating the case said the deputy’s use of force was “legally justified.”\n\nFour different men. Four very different crimes. But their common trait is that each of them had previously received a pardon, commutation or clemency from President Trump. And they’re only a small fraction of a larger number. As our newsroom reported this week, at least eight people to whom Trump granted clemency in his first term have since been charged with a crime.\n\nIn addition, “Several others pardoned more recently after being convicted of offenses committed during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have also run into trouble with the law.”\n\nBut the pardons just keep coming. On Sunday, Trump granted sweeping pardons to 77 people who helped him attempt to subvert the 2020 election. Last week, Trump pardoned Glen Casada, the Republican former speaker of the Tennessee House, and Casada’s former chief of staff, Cade Cothren. Both men had been convicted of charges including wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nIn the same set of pardons, Trump also pardoned Robert Harshbarger Jr., the husband of Diana Harshbarger, a Republican representative from Tennessee. As our newsroom reported, Robert had pleaded guilty to “health care fraud and distributing a misbranded drug, in this case kidney medications, some of which came from China, that were not approved for the purpose by the Food and Drug Administration.”\n\nThis is just a partial list of the most notorious and unjustifiable pardons of Trump’s second term so far.\n\nI mentioned one of the most brazen in my column two Sundays ago — the pardon of the crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao.\n\nThe pardon came after Zhao’s company, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal, “took steps that catapulted the Trump family venture’s new stablecoin product, enhancing its credibility and pushing its market capitalization up from $127 million to over $2.1 billion.”\n\nSo what do all of these people have in common? It’s certainly not that they’re deserving of pardons. There isn’t a meaningful claim of actual innocence in the bunch, and in almost every case there’s no meaningful evidence of unusually harsh treatment or unjust sentencing. No, the thing they have in common is they are either allies of Trump and his associates or used connections to Trump or his family (or helped enrich Trump) to get relief from justice.\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to abuse the pardon power. In his last weeks in office, Joe Biden pardoned his son and commuted the sentences of thousands of other convicted criminals. Some of these pardons were defensible, but many were not. As Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The Times in October, “Biden acted over the objections of his own Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice, which performed rigorous scrutiny of the applicants for clemency.”\n\nAll told, Biden granted 80 pardons and 4,165 commutations during his one four-year term, a number, according to the Pew Research Center, that “far exceeds the total of any other president since the beginning of the 20th century, including Franklin D. Roosevelt.”\n\nAny list of Bill Clinton’s most infamous acts also includes pardons. On his last day in office, he pardoned his brother, Roger, from his drug conviction, and he pardoned a fugitive named Marc Rich after Rich’s ex-wife, Denise, gave $450,000 to the Clinton Presidential Library.\n\nGerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon, while not corrupt, was also deeply misguided. It set a precedent of placing American presidents beyond the reach of the law. But Andrew Johnson’s blanket pardon of Confederates was infinitely worse — it cleared the way for their return to state and federal power after the Civil War and helped set the stage for a century of brutal repression of Black Americans in the South.\n\nIn fact, if we’re going to compare Trump to anyone, Johnson is the best match. Just like Johnson, Trump pardoned men who directly attacked American democracy. Unlike Johnson, however, Trump’s pardons are obvious rewards for personal service and for personal connections.\n\nActing just like a corrupt king, Trump is transforming the American system of justice into his personal plaything. Friends of the crown break the law with impunity. Enemies of the crown experience the sharp end of the law, whether they deserve it or not.\n\nWe can’t say we weren’t warned. If there was one element of the American Constitution that set off the most urgent alarm during the founding era, it was the pardon power — Article II’s grant of absolute, unchecked power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”\n\nFor example, at the Virginia ratification convention, George Mason, a founding father and delegate to the Constitutional Convention, was recorded as saying that the president “ought not to have the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself” — a situation that eerily forecasts Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons.\n\nMason was concerned that the president’s pardon power was so great that it could be fatal to the United States. “It may happen, at some future day,” Mason said, “that he will establish a monarchy, and destroy the republic.”\n\nWriting under the pseudonym Cato, an anti-Federalist thought to be the then-New York governor George Clinton warned against the “unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason, which may be used to screen from punishment, those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt.”\n\nAgain, there are echoes of Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, except there was nothing secret about Trump’s misconduct in 2020 and 2021.\n\nWriting under the pseudonym Brutus, an anti-Federalist thought to be Robert Yates, an associate justice of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, warned that the pardon power (among other presidential powers) would be used “to the purposes of gratifying their own interest and ambition, and it is scarcely possible, in a very large republic, to call them to account for their misconduct, or to prevent their abuse of power.”\n\nThe Federalists’ answer to the anti-Federalists was simple — don’t worry, they argued; Congress will impeach a corrupt president. In his response to Mason, James Madison reportedly argued, “If the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any persons, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter himself; the House of Representatives can impeach him: They can remove him if found guilty.”\n\nYes, the House can impeach the president. Yes, the Senate can convict him or her. But the Senate has never convicted an American president, and there is no real hope that it ever will. If history teaches us anything, it’s that impeachment has not checked presidential abuses of power, and it’s hard to imagine that it ever will.\n\nAnd so we remain at risk, and it’s not hard to see how Trump could use the pardon power to break American democracy. His pardons won’t just protect friends and family members who abuse power to enrich themselves, as bad as that is. As his Jan. 6 pardons show, he’ll use the power to excuse even those allies who commit acts of sedition.\n\nI shudder to think of the outright criminality that Trump and his allies could resort to during the 2026 midterms, much less the 2028 presidential election. One doesn’t have to imagine wild fantasies of a Trump third term to imagine systemic abuses of power to suppress or miscount dissenting votes — all to hand power to his chosen successor, who can then enter office free of any federal criminal cloud.\n\nI’m frequently asked about my ideas for legal and constitutional reform. I revere the Constitution, but it’s not a divinely inspired document. Our founders did have blind spots, and it’s quite clear that one of the most glaring was handing too much power to the president.\n\nI know that constitutional amendments sound unrealistic. But we are afflicted with recency bias, tempted to think that our present polarization is a permanent part of American politics. But it is not. We have cycled through episodes of division and unity, and periods of crisis are often followed by periods of reform.\n\nTo give the most salient example, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments that were ratified after the Civil War gave life to Abraham Lincoln’s promise in the Gettysburg Address of a “new birth of freedom.” The amendments were so consequential that they represented a second founding of the United States of America.\n\nAfter Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive presidential terms, we amended the Constitution to term-limit presidents. In the years following Watergate, Congress passed a series of statutory reforms intended to limit presidential power. The Trump era shall pass as well, and those of us who love our American republic should be prepared to close its constitutional loopholes and destroy the imperial presidency once and for all.\n\nHere’s one suggestion: Amend Article II so that it states that the president “shall have Power, with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate, to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”\n\nThe pardon power should exist as a matter of last resort, deployed only when the American legal system has truly failed to deliver justice, or when the national interest in a pardon is overwhelming. The legislative approval should be supermajority so that it’s broadly supported by America’s elected representatives.\n\nAn amendment to the pardon power stands a chance in part because public disgust at presidential pardon abuse is bipartisan. Republicans are furious at Biden. Democrats are furious at Trump. Millions of Americans are disgusted by both men’s pardons — as well as many of the pardons that came before.\n\nTo preserve America’s future, we need to heed the warnings of the past. We can’t dismiss this statement as a mere truism. The fears of the anti-Federalists were rooted in raw truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of unchecked power. And few of those fears were more urgent — or more prescient — than the warning against one of the last vestiges of royalty in American law.\n\nOn Sunday, I wrote about the fight for the soul of the Republican Party and the dark and disturbing rise of antisemitism and even admiration for Hitler in parts of the right. In short, the fish rots from the head:\n\nA movement, especially one that verges on an outright cult of personality, is defined by its leader, not by its rank and file. And when the leader is lawless and depraved, then efforts to contain his influence while preserving his power are doomed to fail.\n\nThe proof is everywhere. Throughout the Trump era, many of the most prominent voices of right-wing America have only become shriller, angrier and, yes, more racist and more antisemitic. The right-wing media universe is culturally different in 2025 than it was in 2015 — substantially so.\n\nThe balance of power has flipped upside down. The fringe has become mainstream, and the mainstream has become fringe.\n\nOn Saturday, my conversation with Michelle Cottle and Jamelle Bouie centered around the 2025 elections. Why did the Democrats do so well? In part because they fielded quality candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. But it’s also because Trump forgot the reason he won:\n\nFrench: The Trump administration in a lot of ways misread its victory in a pretty dramatic fashion. It was not a mandate to pardon all the Jan. 6-ers. It was not a mandate to go after every dissenting law firm in America. It was not a mandate to put masked police all over the streets of American cities and engage in gross and brutal acts of violence out in public on a nearly daily basis. It was not a mandate to engineer military deployments to American cities on obviously false, fake pretext.\n\nSo, look, none of this should be surprising. This wasn’t what he was elected by, the big mass of people who are not MAGA. Now, you will find on Twitter all the time this sentiment where it’s a very brutal video or a very vicious statement from Trump and people will say, “I voted for this.” Or the grainy videos of the drone strikes or the airstrikes in, outside of Venezuela.\n\nCottle: Yeah, but Twitter’s still not real life.\n\nFrench: That’s what I’m saying — that’s not real life. They have convinced themselves it is.\n\nAnd then the other thing here is that unless the Republicans course-correct, unless they get this through their heads, they’re going to continue to have this problem: There’s no sign that the administration itself is really keeping its eye on the public as opposed to this weird, bespoke world of right-wing influencers. This is how they’re gauging themselves a lot, is: How is the right-wing podcast world or the right-wing Twitter world reacting to me? And they’re exquisitely sensitive about that, and they don’t give a rip about normal political metrics and measures and normal political rhetoric.\n\nSo if they keep doing this, we are not on their floor yet. We are nowhere near their floor.\n\nThank you for being a subscriber\n\nIf you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others. They can sign up here.

Sorrows\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:03:41-05:00\n\nArt history, which likes categories and keeping things neat, has never known what to do with certain artists, Wifredo Lam (1902-1982) being one. Surrealist? Cubist? Latin American? Afro-Asian? Insider? Outlier? Yes. No. Sort of. Maybe.\n\nSo how about we go with Unclassifiably Fabulous Visual Poet? Even a speed-walk through the Museum of Modern Art’s blazingly hallucinatory retrospective, “Wifredo Lam: When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream,” will confirm that, whatever else Lam is, he’s definitely that.\n\nAnd like many artists, he was his own most eloquent explicator. In an interview he said, “I have been considered a painter of the School of Paris, a Surrealist painter, but never as a representative of the painting that I really do and in which I believe I reflect, to a large extent, the poetry of the Africans who came to Cuba, poetry that still hides much pain in its songs.”\n\nOrganized by MoMA’s new director, Christophe Cherix, with Beverly Adams, curator of Latin American Art, and others, the show is the first in the United States to document the full arc of Lam’s career. And it begins, usefully, early, mapping the indirect path that brought Lam to be the artist-poet of his self-description.\n\nHe was born in Cuba in 1902, in a sugar-cane-harvesting region, to an immigrant Chinese father and a mother of West African and colonial Spanish descent. Most accounts of his life add a third parental figure, Ma’ Antonica Wilson, a priestess of the Afro-Cuban religion of Santeria, who served as his spiritual godmother.\n\nHis parents noted his drawing skills when he was young and sent him to art school in Havana. In 1923, he received a government scholarship earmarked for young persons “of color” and traveled to Spain for further study. For some years there he seems to have stuck with academic fare — still life, landscape — and a realist style, with at least one arresting exception in the form of a Fauve-ish painting of an ambiguously gendered dark-skinned figure wrapped in a florid Chinese robe. A self-portrait?\n\nIn 1930 he married and had a child, supporting his new family, precariously, with portrait commissions. Disaster hit. Both his wife and 1-year-old son died of tuberculosis. Grief, it seems, broke Lam down, but also opened him up. He went deeper into art, updating himself on new developments in Paris and the rest of Europe. And he got politically active, joining the Republican army at the start of the Spanish Civil War, a grueling commitment that, in 1937, produced his first major painting.\n\nTitled “La Guerra Civil (The Spanish Civil War),” and done on the cheap, mostly in blue and black gouache on a big sheet of commercial packaging paper, it’s a scene of Fascist troops slaughtering Spanish citizens. The painting style — a chaos of swipes and blotches in a dimensionless space — is half-abstract, but the bad-dream emotion conveyed, of a world in a state of emergency, is specific and strong, a dynamic Lam will recreate in future work.\n\nIn 1938, exhausted, he left Spain for Paris, and there a new story starts. On arrival he is embraced by Picasso and the poets and artists of the Surrealist wave. In quick order, he sets up a small studio, lands a gallery, and scores the sale of brand-new work — a Cubist pieta of a picture called “Mother and Child” (it’s in the show) — to MoMA.\n\nBut World II has now started. German troops are in Paris and the art world is streaming out, heading south to Marseilles and from there across the Atlantic to safety. Camped-out life in Marseilles must have been quite a scene, a big, scared party. Artists and writers passed some of this tense time playing the Surrealist game called “Exquisite Corpse,” in which, collectively, they made composite figurative drawings and collages, with each player contributing a part of the image.\n\nLam participated in the game, and the fantastical, often grotesque imagery that resulted seems to have established a stylistic touchstone for his painting to come. And the sea voyage itself clarified an existing content that was waiting to be revealed.\n\nOn the ship’s first stop, in Martinique, Lam met the Black poet and politician Aimé Césaire, shaper of the Negritude movement. They shared an instant rapport and would become collaborators. And partly because of this bonding, when Lam ended his trip in Cuba, landing there for the first time in 18 years, he was ready, in a way he had not consciously been before, to focus his attention on the Afro-Atlantic culture that was his heritage.\n\nIt was through changed eyes that he saw the tropical island he’d left. Lush and green, it was still a natural paradise, but one despoiled by centuries of Western colonialist racism and greed. In a late-life interview with the Cuban critic and curator Gerardo Mosquera, Lam labeled the art he would make from that time forward “an act of decolonization.” And once back in Cuba he got right down to it, producing, in 1943, the monumental astounder of a picture titled “La Jungla” (The Jungle).\n\nIf spatial depth in “La Guerra Civil” was depicted as an abstract whiteness, like fog, in “La Jungla” it’s all but blocked from view by a crowd of upright figures jammed together against a solid wall composed of stalks of sugar cane, the money crop for which African men, women and children, shipped to the Caribbean as enslaved people, were forced to do the crushing work of harvesting.\n\nBut the figures gathered here, some with faces resembling Picassoid versions of African masks, don’t appear to be slaves. Of indeterminate species, they don’t represent “the Africans who came to Cuba,” but the cultural essence of Africa itself. The picture, with its palette of succulent greens and mango-yellows, is a classical pastorale of a kind Lam knew from European art history, transformed by the energies of the living Afro-Caribbean spirituality he experienced in childhood, without ever becoming a practitioner.\n\nAnd those energies infused almost all the art he made from that point on. They certainly animate the even more spectacular, mural-size painting-on-paper titled simply “Grande Composition.” (Completed in 1949, and recently acquired by MoMA, it’s been out of sight for 60 years, and is being shown in the United States for the first time.)\n\nHere the palette is subdued — black, white and brown; shadow-and-light — but the contents are even more determinedly multicultural, with spiritual power-figures — a horse-headed woman, lifted straight from Afro-Cuban sources — accompanied by images of Native American and Oceanic masks, all set in frieze-like silhouette against a dark ground.\n\nLater, figures will decrease in number and become crazily, almost comically abstract, as in the 1955 painting from which the exhibition takes its name. And then, in a handful of pictures from the late 1950s, they will disappear altogether, replaced by dense  fields of floating lines suggesting smoldering earth, sacrificial pyres and cosmic conflagrations.\n\nPolitical and poetic, ideally mutually inclusive terms, are equally apt descriptions for these paintings, and for all of this cosmopolitan artist’s work and thought. (Lam moved  permanently from Cuba to Europe in 1952, and traveled internationally throughout his life, finally settling in Italy.)\n\nAlthough initially leery of the critical notion of biography-as-destiny — the idea that a lived life might be used as absolute measure of the meaning and worth of what it produced — he understood, at a fairly early point, that the experience of otherness, which was his experience as an Afro-Asian Latino, came with insights and obligations that would and should shape his art.\n\nIn this regard, Lam has much to say to succeeding generations of artists. And the exhibition catalog concludes with a small album-like group show of some who acknowledge his influence, including McArthur Binion, Mel Edwards, Teresita Fernández, Raphael Ferrer, Rashid Johnson, Ana Mendieta and Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons. And to which company I would add the names of two extraordinary Cuban artists now gone, Belkis Ayón (1967-99) and Juan Francisco Elso (1956-88).\n\nAs for “poetic,” Lam adored poetry. He said so again and again. He found it in many forms and places. And poets found it in him. In 1941, André Breton chose Lam drawings to illustrate his book-length poem “Fata Morgana,” creating one of Surrealism’s landmark word-and-image collaborations. Lam later provided illustrations for history-altering poetry books by Aimé Césaire, René Char and Édouard Glissant. And in 1982, the last year of his life, a collaboration was flipped when Césaire, in a gesture of tribute, added his poems to a portfolio of Lam’s prints.\n\nThe MoMA retrospective is also a tribute, though it doesn’t call itself that.\n\nPerfectly proportioned, beautifully installed, it lets a figure who has long been defined by associative labels be the distinctive and peerless artist-poet he was.\n\nWifredo Lam: When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream\n\nThrough April 11, 2026, at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400; moma.org.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/12/nyregion/inertia-penn-station-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-12","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Local Health Department Reports Outbreak of Rare Illness in Residential Neighborhood","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent incident involving a public health emergency has been reported in the local area.

But Penn Station, in Midtown Manhattan, was the busiest transportation hub in North America, and Mr. Clinton had made public transit a priority. He and Gov. George E. Pataki posed beside a miniature model of a grand new train hall, while Senator Daniel P. Moynihan extolled its future grandeur.\n\n“Penn Station is the start,” Mr. Moynihan said, “and we will find — when we complete this project — that suddenly all will seem possible.”\n\nMore than 25 years, five presidencies and four governors later, the plan to rebuild Penn Station is nowhere near completion.\n\nFor the 600,000 people who pass through every day, Penn Station is indispensable. It remains the busiest transit hub in the United States, with nearly double the number of daily passengers as the busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. Much of the Eastern Seaboard might grind to a halt without it.\n\nIt is also widely abhorred. Passengers descend into a gloomy, dimly lit warren of overcrowded concourses, much of it layered in grime and corroded by decay, sitting above an array of subterranean tracks whose age creates regular snarls and delays that cost New York millions of dollars in lost productivity each day.\n\nMore broadly, it is a stagnant symbol of something deeper in America, a condition that afflicts so many attempts to get big things done: inertia. Again and again, when America undertakes big projects, politics and government get in the way.\n\nThe owners of Madison Square Garden, the arena that sits on top of Penn Station, have rejected proposals to move it.\n\nCountless ideas for making Penn Station grander and more commuter-friendly have been floated and shelved over the decades. The conversion of the James A. Farley Building across Eighth Avenue into Moynihan Hall for passengers was an exception, if one that ran wildly over budget and beyond schedule. But Moynihan, named for the senator, is mostly ornamental. With each attempt to restart work on the larger underground station, progress has been torpedoed by a political rivalry or a powerful billionaire or infighting among transit agencies with their own priorities.\n\nAs yardsticks of American progress go, Penn Station does not inspire pride. Since Mr. Clinton’s appearance there 26 years ago, China has constructed nearly 30,000 miles of high-speed rail tracks and built more than a thousand new stations.\n\nThere have been other bright spots, such as the renovation of LaGuardia Airport in New York. But that took more than eight years. Saudi Arabia built an entire transit system in Riyadh in a little over 10 years.\n\nIn the United States, the investment of billions of dollars in taxpayer money and the extraordinary undertaking of renovating century-old infrastructure are among the many reasons large projects stall before they even get off the ground.\n\nBut the failure often starts and stops with politics. Some critics blame multiple layers of federal, state and local regulations that deter investment. Some blame a progressive inclination to spread authority to community groups and individuals. Others point to extreme partisan politics as the root of the paralysis.\n\nPenn Station has basically the same array of tracks and platforms as when it first opened in 1910.\n\n“We’ve got a system that doesn’t have anyone who can actually make the decision,” said Marc J. Dunkelman, a research fellow at Brown University and the author of “Why Nothing Works.” The stasis at Penn Station is a “microcosm of why generally government doesn’t work,” he said.\n\nEliot Spitzer, a former Democratic governor of New York, said Penn Station was “a classic example” of how “fractured decision-making” leads to delays and conflicting priorities.\n\n“When you have that many entities involved, it makes it nearly impossible to get a resolution,” he said.\n\nPenn has long been a station divided, carved up into fiefs occupied and maintained by railroads whose managers constantly compete for authority and resources.\n\nThe station itself, sitting beneath Madison Square Garden, is owned and controlled by Amtrak, the national passenger railroad.\n\nBut its primary users are two state-run transit agencies: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the Long Island Rail Road in New York, and NJ Transit. Each has exclusive use of some tracks and platforms.\n\nBut they must share most of the tracks and platforms with Amtrak, which has the ultimate say over train movements in and out of the station.\n\nThe tension among those three agencies has been compounded by the intransigence of James L. Dolan, the billionaire whose company owns Madison Square Garden, which has squatted atop the station for more than 60 years. Their failure to collaborate on a solution has left Penn mired in a sorry state that has been lamented by a generation of everyday commuters.\n\nIn New York, a long line of strong-willed elected officials — Mr. Spitzer included — have pledged that a makeover of Penn Station was on the way.\n\nIn 2006, Mr. Pataki, the Republican governor, spoke of creating “a visionary new Pennsylvania Station.” His successor, Mr. Spitzer, said in 2008 that he was committed to a revamp of Penn that would “redefine Midtown Manhattan.” In 2016, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo likened the station to “seven levels of hell” and, rolling out his own $3 billion plan, vowed, “This will get done.”\n\nMost recently, the current governor, Kathy Hochul, said that “New Yorkers do not deserve what they have been subjected to for decades at Penn Station” and presented a revised version of Mr. Cuomo’s proposal with an estimated cost of more than $6 billion.\n\nAfter all of that talk about all of those visions, Penn Station remains a confusing, overburdened labyrinth of hallways and stairwells buried beneath a 20,000-seat entertainment venue.\n\nPenn Station now serves more daily passengers than even the busiest airport in America.\n\nIts century-old infrastructure takes frequent bites out of the metropolitan economy: Every hour of delay for commuters from Long Island or New Jersey costs the city’s employers nearly $20 million, according to an inflation-adjusted estimate from the Partnership for New York City, a business group.\n\nKathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the partnership, said in 2017 that “Penn Station is a symbol of the failure of America to keep up with the escalating demands on urban public transportation.”\n\nShe reiterated that sentiment in September: “Nothing has changed.”\n\nCommunity advocates agree. “We really do have a tragic level of institutional dysfunction with warring entities,” said Lynn Ellsworth, who in 2020 co-founded the Empire Station Coalition, which called for a redesign that would render Penn Station more efficient, more welcoming and easier to navigate.\n\nThe railroads that coexist within the station, Ms. Ellsworth said, “don’t have the managerial competence to rise above their parochial self-interests.”\n\nPenn Station is a layer cake of inadequacy, with three levels that complicate all efforts to improve service for the thousands of people passing through every day.\n\nNew York officials have frequently likened a trip through Penn to a descent into hell. Andy Byford, the Amtrak executive recently put in charge of overhauling the station, described the platforms as a “dark, gloomy, boiling-hot, narrow and cramped situation.”\n\nOn the bottom, hundreds of daily trains are confined to essentially the same century-old 21-track layout built for smaller, less frequent trains. The time it takes to get trains in and out of the station is now a main cause of delays and slowdowns.\n\nIn the 1960s, when Penn Station was rebuilt with Madison Square Garden atop it, more than 1,000 columns were driven through the platforms, into the bedrock of Manhattan, to support the massive venue and an adjacent office tower.\n\nIn 2025, all those columns — plus staircases, escalators and elevators — force passengers to squeeze through narrow gaps that are sometimes only a few feet wide. Currently, there is not enough space on each platform to hold both arriving and departing riders.\n\nAs passengers ascend to the concourse, they are confronted with a low-ceilinged maze of subterranean corridors into which no natural light has ever shone.\n\nTrack assignments aren’t announced until the last minute to prevent collisions between departing and arriving passengers. So people clump together on the concourse levels — like in this cramped, poorly ventilated NJ Transit waiting area.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to a total overhaul of Penn Station is the arena that replaced the original station in the 1960s. Any rearrangement or expansion of the tracks and platforms on the bottom must first grapple with the forest of steel beams holding up the Garden.\n\nRight now, Amtrak is focused on the construction of a new two-track rail tunnel under the Hudson River, a $16 billion project known as Gateway. (This fall, the Trump administration suspended federal funding for the project and threatened to terminate it in an apparent attempt to pressure Democrats amid a government shutdown.)\n\nThe Gateway project would significantly increase train capacity across the Hudson and would require big changes at Penn Station.\n\nThe Garden’s owners, who own the air rights for any development above the station, have resisted recent attempts to arrange the arena’s relocation. In 2023, city officials renewed the Garden’s operating permit for an additional five years.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Dolan, the chairman of MSG Entertainment, said in an interview: “Another five years and there’ll be some changes in the political structure and we’ll go at it again. Nothing is going to happen.”\n\nIn that 2023 interview, Mr. Dolan expressed doubt that the station’s stakeholders would agree on a comprehensive plan to improve it any time soon.\n\n“We never get to the finish line, and it’s because of all the politicking and bureaucracy and because of all the different constituencies,” he said. “I mean, there’s New Jersey Transit, there’s Amtrak, there’s the M.T.A., there’s the governor’s office, there’s the city. And everybody has to say yes. And everybody’s got a stick in the fire.”\n\nThe roots of all this dysfunction can be traced back more than a century.\n\nIn 1901, Alexander J. Cassatt, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, was a frustrated train traveler. To get from Philadelphia to New York City, he had to transfer at his company’s easternmost terminal in Jersey City to a ferry that would carry him the last mile across the Hudson River.\n\nAt the time, the country’s rail system was a robust collection of independent companies vying for prominence on the most popular routes. Collaboration was never in their DNA.\n\nHis railroad’s main rival, the New York Central Railroad, had already built itself a terminal in the heart of Manhattan, which later became Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Cassatt burned for a competitive foothold in the nation’s largest city.\n\n“We must find a way to cross,” he said, according to “Conquering Gotham,” a 2007 book by Jill Jonnes.\n\nWithin 10 years, Mr. Cassatt’s company had completed the unprecedented feat of digging a tunnel under the Hudson to connect to a station it had created west of Seventh Avenue in Midtown: the new Pennsylvania Station.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad, commonly known as the Pennsy, declared that the station would have “the character of a monumental gateway and entrance to a great metropolis.”\n\nWhen it opened in 1910, it was heralded as the largest building ever built at one time. Modeled after the Baths of Caracalla in Rome, the Beaux-Arts station was constructed of pink granite, travertine marble and glass skylights.\n\nUnlike now, arriving passengers ascended into a palatial train hall with an airy concourse topped by vaulted ceilings.\n\n“In our history, there was never another building like Pennsylvania Station,” the architect Philip Johnson wrote. “It compares to the great cathedrals of Europe.”\n\nThe tracks connected the station to new tunnels under the East River, as well as the Hudson, allowing trains to reach Manhattan from the east and the west.\n\nThen, in the 1960s, the glorious original station was torn down to make way for the Garden, and train riders were moved underground. The demolition of Penn became a rallying cry for preservationists.\n\nOriginally, Penn Station was the province of the Pennsy’s intercity trains and Long Island Rail Road commuter service.\n\nThat centralized control could have continued after the mid-1960s if not for one critical error, said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University.\n\nIn 1965, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller had New York buy the struggling L.I.R.R. for $65 million and created the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to manage it. William J. Ronan, the man Mr. Rockefeller hired to run the authority, told Mr. Moss that Rockefeller had passed up the opportunity to also acquire Penn Station for a price that would seem like a screaming bargain today, Mr. Moss recounted.\n\n“He felt that was a terrific mistake,” Mr. Moss said, recalling their conversation at the Everglades Club in Palm Beach, Fla., about 12 years ago.\n\n“The fundamental original sin was not buying Penn Station,” said Mr. Moss, a critic of how Amtrak has managed the station. “That’s the key error, and that has created a lack of clarity about who controls Penn Station.”\n\nInstead, the M.T.A. wound up as a tenant of Amtrak, the federal corporation that inherited many of the Pennsy’s assets after a 1970 bankruptcy.\n\nMore than a thousand steel support beams contribute to a cramped feeling on the platforms.\n\nLike NJ Transit, the L.I.R.R., the busiest commuter railroad in the country, has carved out its own separate and unequal territory within Penn Station.\n\nThe dividing lines are clear, at least to those who understand the station’s entrenched rules of engagement, as Janno Lieber, the chairman of the M.T.A., does.\n\nStanding beneath a tangle of exposed pipes and wires in a corridor known as the Hilton Passageway, Mr. Lieber explained that each of the railroads is responsible for maintaining its own turf, including the platforms and tracks that only it can use.\n\nNorth of the passageway, his agency handles the waxing of the floors and the cleaning of the restrooms. Its police force patrols the concourses.\n\nSouth of the passageway, those burdens fall on NJ Transit, a perennially struggling state-run corporation. Its workers, clad in fluorescent green T-shirts, replace lightbulbs and scrub the metal prison-style toilets.\n\nThe station has several street-level entrances leading down to the various railroads’ concourses.\n\nEach railroad has its own dedicated entrance at the front of the station on Seventh Avenue.\n\nNJ Transit’s leads to a waiting area that is cooled by a fleet of large, portable air-conditioners whose exhaust is vented through white ducts that snake up to the ceiling. The cramped area is known to commuters as “the pit” because of how crowded it gets during evening rush hour.\n\nL.I.R.R. customers enter through a broad concourse that was recently widened, brightened and filled with cafes and fast-food shops. Mr. Lieber called it “a much more functional environment” that had come about because the transportation authority chose not to wait for an agreement with the other railroads and, on its own, overhauled just the areas it managed.\n\n“We kind of took control of our destiny and said this can’t go on any longer,” Mr. Lieber said.\n\nUntangling the knot of Penn Station’s shortcomings is a challenge that has long stymied New York’s most powerful elected officials.\n\nIn 2005, Gov. Eliot Spitzer came as close as any governor ever has to clearing the way for a more majestic rebuild of Penn Station when Mr. Dolan agreed, in general terms, to the relocation of the Garden across Eighth Avenue.\n\nBut the plan met opposition from preservationists. Mr. Dolan wanted to back out, but Mr. Spitzer, who called himself a “bulldozer,” plowed ahead. In March 2008, the two men had a tense meeting that Mr. Dolan later recounted to a New York Times reporter. “He was tough,” Mr. Dolan said of the governor.\n\nA week later, Mr. Spitzer was caught up in a prostitution scandal and resigned. By the end of the month, Mr. Dolan’s company announced that the Garden was “not moving,” effectively killing any hopes for Mr. Spitzer’s plan.\n\nSeveral years passed before another brash Democratic governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, took on the challenge of fixing Penn Station — without trying to move the Garden.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Cuomo unveiled a $3 billion plan to “dramatically renovate” Penn Station, starting with a long-stalled idea to convert the neighboring Farley Building, which had been the General Post Office, into a train hall that would serve as an annex for Penn.\n\nMoynihan Train Hall, shown under construction in 2017, occupies a former post office building on Eighth Avenue.\n\nThat idea, first broached by Senator Moynihan, had “languished because of a lack of financing, political inertia, squabbles with transportation agencies and the developers’ ambitions,” The Times reported in early 2009.\n\nMr. Cuomo’s plan centered on a partnership between the state and two of the country’s biggest developers, Related Companies and Vornado.\n\nThe governor became intensely involved, even threatening at one point to replace the private partners because they were not moving fast enough. He drove that project over the finish line at the end of 2020, more than 25 years after it was first proposed.\n\n“Moynihan is a really good Phase One; it’s the appetizer,” said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a New York architect who has been calling for a radical overhaul of Penn Station since 2016. “But the main station in the subbasement of the Garden is the entree.”\n\nTransportation experts give credit to Mr. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations and ran unsuccessfully for mayor this year, for applying his famously abrasive personality to get Moynihan Train Hall finished.\n\nBut they also note that the project was much less costly and less complicated than renovating Penn Station. New Jersey had little say in the design of Moynihan, and the fact that many NJ Transit trains are accessible from its glass-roofed hall goes virtually unmentioned inside the building.\n\nAs soon as Kathy Hochul succeeded Mr. Cuomo, she made improving Penn Station a priority. Within months of taking office, she stood at a lectern in the station and promised it would be transformed from a “hellhole” into a world-class transit hub.\n\nSome proposals have suggested reorganizing the region’s rail system to have trains continue past Penn, a practice known as through-running.\n\nThe M.T.A., which the governor controls, would take the lead on managing a rebuilding plan with an estimated cost of close to $7 billion, she said. Amtrak and NJ Transit accepted supporting roles in the planning.\n\n“It’s going to right the wrongs of the past,” Ms. Hochul said. “It’s going to jump-start something that should have been done a long time ago.”\n\nMs. Hochul indicated that the state was open to suggestions for how Penn should be improved, and proposals began to roll in. A private developer, ASTM North America, teamed up with Mr. Chakrabarti’s studio, PAU, to propose a design that would require the acquisition and removal of a theater attached to the Garden along Eighth Avenue. Amtrak officials supported the concept, but Mr. Lieber rejected the idea of paying a large sum to Mr. Dolan’s company.\n\nOther architects put forward different ways of renovating the station. Some revived the idea of building a new home for the Garden nearby. Others centered on reorganizing the region’s rail service so that Penn would not have to be expanded at all.\n\nAll of them awaited word from New York officials about how and when the project would get rolling.\n\nAfter Donald J. Trump was elected president again last November, Ms. Hochul asked him to have the federal government cover most of the cost of a new station, she said. She even floated the idea that it could be renamed after him.\n\nRather than bankrolling New York’s plan, the Trump administration announced this spring that it had lost faith in the state’s ability to manage the project and reassigned it to Amtrak. Sean P. Duffy, the transportation secretary, appointed Mr. Byford, who earned the nickname “Train Daddy” when he oversaw the city’s subway system from 2018 to early 2020, to take charge of the “transformation” of Penn Station.\n\nSome advocates of the renovation said they worried that Mr. Trump’s involvement would set the project back to square one. But others said that having decision-making power concentrated in a president who sees himself as a builder might be the best recipe for a better Penn.\n\n“He just took over Penn Station,” Mr. Cuomo said in a recent interview. “The M.T.A. was working on it for years and had a whole plan.” The former governor added that he expected that Penn was “going to wind up being Trump Station, in the heart of Manhattan.”\n\nMs. Hochul responded to the federal intercession by withdrawing New York’s financial commitment.\n\nSean P. Duffy, left, the transportation secretary, appointed Andy Byford to oversee the rebuilding of Penn Station.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ms. Hochul said she was not abandoning the project. “I’m just happy that I don’t have to put money in it,” she said.\n\nRecounting a conversation with Mr. Trump, she said she had pointed out that Amtrak owned the station. “Why should we have to pay for a building that’s owned by this other entity?” Ms. Hochul said she had asked Mr. Trump.\n\nStill, she told the president: “We have the possibility of getting this underway before you leave office. Let’s make that our goal,” she recalled. “He agreed.”\n\nNow the future of Penn Station rests with Mr. Byford, who said he had been told to get construction started before the end of 2027. He laid out an accelerated schedule that included a solicitation of bids from private companies that want to serve as the project’s master developer. Amtrak will make a decision by May 2026, he said.\n\nMr. Byford said the bidding would be “an open and fair competition with no preconceived notions of the outcome, but it will be conducted to a very aggressive timeline.”\n\nHe said Amtrak’s longstanding plan to expand the station by taking over all or part of a neighboring block of Midtown was “on hold” to focus attention on the makeover. In the meantime, he said, federal transportation officials will study whether having commuter trains pass through Penn and continue on to stations outside the city instead of turning around — a practice known as through-running — could accommodate projected growth in rail traffic in the region.\n\nTransit advocates have long bemoaned the political morass that has slowed down efforts to fix Penn.\n\nMs. Ellsworth, a proponent of running the L.I.R.R. and NJ Transit trains through the city and into each other’s territory, said she had been calling for the federal government to put an end to the infighting and red tape that had thwarted all hopes for an improved station.\n\n“We need a parent to come in here and knock heads between the various entities,” she said.\n\nMr. Dunkelman of Brown University was skeptical that “you’re somehow going to bring in a czar who can wrangle all the separate interests.”\n\n“Maybe the Train Daddy will figure it out and get it done, but the fundamental issue here is not one of personality or incompetence,” he said. “It’s a political octopus built to fail.”\n\nPatrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the infrastructure of New York City and the surrounding area, including its airports and other transportation hubs.Katherine Rosman and Andrew Keh contributed reporting.
