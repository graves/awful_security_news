and Letitia James to disqualify Lindsey Halligan \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The criminal cases against two of the president’s fervent political adversaries face a critical test Thursday, as attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James argue in court that the prosecutor who single-handedly brought their charges is unlawfully serving in her post.\n \n\n   \n  The argument has put a target on Lindsey Halligan, President Donald Trump’s handpicked interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who was tapped for the job days after her predecessor was  ousted for resisting  bringing charges against James related to a mortgage fraud investigation.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge concludes that Halligan’s appointment is invalid, the decision could be a fatal blow to the cases against both Comey and James because she is the only federal prosecutor who signed their indictments, which were approved by a federal grand jury this fall.\n \n\n   \n  The  argument from both defendants  is relatively straightforward: A US attorney can only serve 120 days on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate. That period had elapsed by the time Halligan was installed as the interim US attorney for the judicial district in September.\n \n\n   \n  And, Comey’s and James’ defense attorneys say, the clock should not be reset just because a new person was appointed.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers, Comey’s attorneys warned that if the attorney general, who makes the appointments, could do so “back-to-back,” then the “120-day period would be rendered meaningless, and the Attorney General could indefinitely evade the alternate procedures that Congress mandated.”\n \n\n   \n  Under federal law, if the Senate hasn’t confirmed a nominee to serve in the role long-term and the 120-day period has passed, the judges in that judicial district must pick someone to serve in the role. In May, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia picked Erik Siebert, whose time as interim US attorney was coming to a close, to continue serving in the job.\n \n\n   \n   In Comey’s case,  his attorneys further argue that a different prosecutor wouldn’t be able to seek a new indictment against the former FBI director since the five-year statute of limitations in his case has already expired.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has  strongly pushed back , saying in court filings that even if the judge were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether because the indictments don’t “hinge on her validly holding that particular office” of interim US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the department have also claimed that Attorney General Pam Bondi can appoint a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.” But several other judges who have considered similar challenges to US attorneys in other states have rejected that argument in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge to Halligan’s authority is being heard in Alexandria, Virginia, by senior US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton who ordinarily sits in South Carolina. Currie was tapped to handle this part of the two cases given the role the other judges in the Eastern District of Virginia play in ensuring there is a top prosecutor in their district.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  James was charged last month with two counts: bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection to a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia. She has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Both trials are tentatively set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/homes/portable-mortgages-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00Z","title":"The Trump Administration Is 'Actively Evaluating' Portable Mortgages.

‘actively evaluating’ portable mortgages. What you need to know \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has another idea to make housing more affordable: Let homeowners   take their mortgage rate with them when they move.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating” so-called portable mortgages. The proposal aims to address the housing market’s lack of supply.\n \n\n   \n  The administration   stepped up efforts to address housing affordability this past week. Pulte – who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-backed entities that guarantee more than half of US mortgages – said officials are also weighing  how to make mortgages assumable  and whether to introduce  a new 50-year mortgage option .\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%,  according  to a Redfin analysis of FHFA data. However, average mortgage rates have remained stubbornly stuck between 6% and 7% for the last few years. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates have been less willing to move and potentially pay hundreds more in interest each month on new mortgages at current rates.\n \n\n   \n  Allowing people to keep their lower mortgage rates could encourage them to move and free up supply. But there are questions about how that would work and whether it might wind up actually raising mortgage rates overall, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by CNN, the FHFA did not provide further details about its plans for portable mortgages. In a statement, a spokesperson said the agency was studying a “wide variety of options” to lower housing costs.\n \n\n   \n    How do portable mortgages work?\n \n\n   \n  A portable mortgage allows a borrower to transfer their existing mortgage and mortgage rate to a new property when they move, instead of taking out a brand-new loan.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, imagine a homeowner selling their house for $400,000 with half of that paid off on a 3% mortgage. With a portable mortgage, they could sell their home and transfer the $200,000 left on the loan to the new house, keeping the 3% rate.\n \n\n   \n  Things get trickier if the new home is more expensive. If it costs $450,000, for example, the buyer would need to cover the extra $50,000 either in cash or through a second, smaller loan likely issued at the current higher interest rate.\n \n\n   \n  The hope is that if homeowners could move without losing their low rates, more homes would go up for sale, giving buyers who’ve been locked out a better shot, Wachter said. But the effects on supply would likely be limited, and it might take Congress passing a law to iron out legal wrinkles.\n \n\n   \n    Might this backfire?\n \n\n   \n  Portable mortgages could disrupt the engine powering the US housing market: mortgage-backed securities. Those are essentially bundles of mortgages that banks or lenders sell to investors, which gives the banks the cash they need to issue new loans and keep the mortgage market flowing.\n \n\n   \n  If homeowners can take their loans with them when they move, fewer loans will be paid off early – which means more risk for investors, who might demand higher interest rates to compensate, Wachter said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, mortgage agreements are clear contracts tied to a specific property, with the home’s address listed as collateral. Transferring that loan to a new house would mean effectively rewriting the contract.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s too early to tell what’s going to happen, but it’s going to be a logistical nightmare,” said Justin Demola, the president of Lenders One, a national alliance of mortgage bankers. “All mortgages have a property address, a legal description. How do you get around that as you’re taking the mortgage to the next property?”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the administration considering?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is also looking into a 50-year mortgage, but the proposal  has drawn backlash  from some housing experts. They argue that the monthly savings would be minimal compared to the significantly higher interest costs over the loan’s life versus a standard 30-year fixed mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  The administration also brought up potentially allowing more assumable loans, meaning homebuyers can take over a seller’s existing mortgage and mortgage rate. Most government-backed loans, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, are already assumable. In fact, there are companies that help buyers find homes with assumable mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  However, Demola said he doesn’t see many first-time homebuyers assuming other people’s mortgages, since doing so typically requires a large cash payment or a second mortgage to buy out the existing loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Loans have been assumable forever. You don’t really see many being assumed right now,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/uk/sami-hamdi-uk-us-ice-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:49:00-05:00","title":"British Journalist Sami Hamdi Detained by U.S. ICE for Speaking Out on Gaza War","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British journalist Sami Hamdi was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over two weeks after speaking at a pro-Palestinian event hosted by CAIR California, despite asserting that he was in the U.S. on a valid visa.

He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions in ICE detention, where he said he was held in a small room with dozens of men and forced to wait more than eight hours for medical care, according to the statement.

But right now, the 34-year-old is barely getting by.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is living paycheck to paycheck and saving almost no money, one of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unaffordable economy.\n \n\n   \n  Worse, the family-owned construction business he works at is shutting down.\n \n\n   \n  “I am going to be unemployed in the next month or two – with no safety net,” said Austin, who declined to share his last name.\n \n\n   \n  An estimated 24% of US households are living paycheck to paycheck so far in 2025, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis released this week. The bank’s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  They found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the “nice-to-have” things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.\n \n\n   \n     No margin for error \n \n\n   \n  Austin, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said he’s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year – everything from teaching to construction – with no luck.\n \n\n   \n  “To be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to own a house and start a family, but I don’t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Living in two different worlds’ \n \n\n   \n  The Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.\n \n\n   \n  Many are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trump  dismisses affordability concerns  as a “con job” conjured up by Democrats based on “fake” polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  “Higher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,” Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n     A growing wage gap \n \n\n   \n  The problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices – especially now that  inflation has reaccelerated. \n \n\n   \n  After-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That’s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.\n \n\n   \n  Wage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Wadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn’t been this high since 2016.\n \n\n   \n     ‘We’re getting nowhere’ \n \n\n   \n  For Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.\n \n\n   \n  Wages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.\n \n\n   \n  “We work full-time and have degrees. And we’re getting nowhere,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY - Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the “deepening affordability crisis” caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.\n \n\n   \n  For the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.\n \n\n   \n  “This could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,” Daco said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing “risk of labor market deterioration.” The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That’s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.\n \n\n   \n     Subprime auto loan troubles \n \n\n   \n  Some Americans are falling behind on their bills – especially those with low credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least  60 days late on their car loans  climbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  That is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  This trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.\n \n\n   \n  Bank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,” said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.\n \n\n   \n  Vanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn’t make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “The cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven’t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with “astronomical” medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  Jones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,” she said. “They need to walk in our shoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/jesse-jackson-hospitalized-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:45:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Rev.

from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose death by suicide spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew.\n \n\n   \n  The emails include a message in which Epstein asserts  President Donald Trump  “knew about the girls” — seemingly in reference to Trump’s  claim that he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club  for poaching young women who worked there. Epstein also wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Trump in a 2018 email to a White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. The disgraced financier also emailed about Trump’s mental state in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the emails, saying  they prove “nothing. ” Trump  accused Democrats of bringing up  Epstein to “deflect” from their handling of  the government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporters went through the thousands of files, and you can read highlights below:\n \n\n   \n    Here’s what’s written in some of the emails\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kaitlin Collins \n \n\n   \n  CNN reviewed some of the emails released from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee this morning in which Jeffrey Epstein mentions President Donald Trump by name.\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [REDACTED] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee  identified  the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s  interview earlier this year  with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, she denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the president has denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein called Trump ‘borderline insane’ in 2018, newly released documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In one of the thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee today, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein called President Donald Trump “borderline insane” in a 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump – borderline insane,” Epstein wrote on December 22, 2018.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what prompted the exchange between Epstein and Summers.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein associates sent him updates on Trump selling his jet, newly released documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  Some of the emails among the thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee today show Jeffrey Epstein getting updates about Donald Trump selling a private plane.\n \n\n   \n  In a message from April 2011, someone told Epstein, “I hear Trump has a contract on his B272” but “no money has changed hands” yet. The sender is redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Someone told Epstein in a May 2011 email, “Trump’s B727 sold for 2.7M.” The sender is redacted, but Epstein and an accountant and lawyer were copied.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein called Trump ‘f**king crazy’ in January 2017 email, new documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  A week after Donald Trump was inaugurated to his first term as US president, he signed an executive order  banning the entry  of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, widely referred to as the “Muslim ban.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffrey Epstein said in an email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017: “IT helps as he is seen as keeping his word.”\n \n\n   \n  He added later in the email: “That being said Donald is f**king crazy, I told you that.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein discussed Trump’s 2016 campaign with Soon-Yi Previn, new documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  The emails show an interesting exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and Soon-Yi Previn, the wife of controversial filmmaker Woody Allen.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent an article to Previn, titled, “Bill Clinton’s CIA chief joins Trump campaign.”  The article , published by The Hill in September 2016, was about the former Clinton-appointed CIA director James Woolsey joining Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Woody said it doesn’t mean anything,” Previn wrote in response to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why Epstein flagged the news to Previn and what if any interest she or her husband would have had in Woolsey’s involvement with Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell coordinated public response after 2015 lawsuit alleged sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In January 2015, an anonymous woman – later revealed to be Virginia Roberts Giuffre –  filed a lawsuit  alleging that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell groomed and sexually abused her between 1998 and 2002. The lawsuit alleged they forced her to become a “sex slave” to powerful men – including a royal prince later revealed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Mountbatten-Windsor, who  has been stripped of his prince title , has denied the allegation and  later settled a lawsuit  Giuffre filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  In several email exchanges on January 10, 2015, after the lawsuit was filed, Epstein and Maxwell coordinated their public response to the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Initial response, too many unanswered question [sic] raised, relationship with jeffrey/…I am writing to writin [sic] to respond to alleagtinoin [sic] that have been made wchich [sic] are categorically untrue,” Epstein wrote Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded by asking if her lawyer could speak with a lawyer, then wrote: “I have to distance myself from you in statement too. And they need me to say I was not aware of massage w/ andrew in my house. These things they have to stay along w/ meeting [REDACTED] and rebutting those allegations. I needs it asap.”\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein assured Maxwell he was on the phone with his lawyer about getting her a lawyer, she replied, “I need it written out in full.”\n \n\n   \n  “Call me,” Epstein replied.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell later  settled  a defamation lawsuit with Giuffre in June 2017 for an undisclosed sum.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the Justice Department this summer, Maxwell said her relationship with Epstein was  “almost nonexistent”  between 2010 and 2019 outside of corresponding over legal matters.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and a former Obama official\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In a March 24, 2018, email chain with  Kathryn   Ruemmler , a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein  shared  a Daily Beast article titled, “How Close Is Donald Trump to a Psychiatric Breakdown?”\n \n\n   \n  The exchange shows Epstein forwarding the story early that morning to Ruemmler, with her replying: “Not confidence inspiring.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein then responded: “but – accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  A year earlier in July 2017, Ruemmler wrote an email to Epstein saying, “Trump is truly stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  “Duh,” Epstein replied several hours later.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler and Epstein were corresponding at the time.\n \n\n   \n  But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   \n  Ruemmler did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2018, Epstein emailed Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior, writing:\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power. tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Epstein forwarded the same comment to Reid Weingarten, an  attorney  who worked for him.\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten replied that Trump was “starting to behave very erratically.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back: “borderline insane. and corroborated by some that are close.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein questioned whether Trump had ‘early dementia’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In early January 2018, as questions swirled about Trump’s behavior  following the release  of Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury,” Epstein exchanged a series of emails with a reporter at The New York Times discussing the president’s mental state.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the reporter an  excerpt  of the book that ran in New York Magazine.\n \n\n   \n  The reporter remarked that Trump was “looking/sounding increasingly unhinged,” Epstein replies, “no questions donalds statement is goofy. . early dementia?”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed then-Prince Andrew: ‘you ok?’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kara Scannell \n \n\n   \n  In March 2011, as the Epstein scandal was picked up by British tabloids focusing on then-Prince Andrew’s involvement, Epstein reached out to Andrew to ask how he was doing.\n \n\n   \n  “you ok?” Epstein wrote to an email identified as “The Duke,” an apparent reference to Andrew, known at the time as the Duke of York. “these stories are complete ant (sic) utter fantasy.”\n \n\n   \n  King Charles stripped Andrew of his prince title last month and forced him to move out of the royal residence. Andrew  relinquished his title  as Duke of York weeks beforehand.\n \n\n   \n    Jeffrey Epstein in 2018: ‘I know how dirty Donald is’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein wrote that, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the message on August 23, 2018, after Trump’s longtime fixer Michael Cohen  pleaded guilty  to federal campaign finances crimes. As part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors, Cohen  implicated Trump  in a 2016 hush-money scheme involving payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair, which Trump denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You see, I know how dirty Donald is,” Epstein wrote in the email. “My guess is that non-lawyers NY biz people have no idea what it means to have your fixer flip.”\n \n\n   \n  The email conversation began when Ruemmler sent Epstein a  New York Times column  about the Cohen guilty plea and what it might mean for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Her email said, “The principled case for impeachment is clear. What’s missing is the courage,” quoting the column.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was not impeached and he never faced any federal charges over the matter despite a  lengthy investigation . However, the Manhattan district attorney later won an indictment of Trump on state charges in connection with the matter.  Trump was convicted  last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payments.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein corresponded with Steve Bannon about then-Prince Andrew and Trump\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In early June 2019, President Trump made a state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was welcomed by the former Prince Andrew. A  photo shows Andrew grinning  as he shakes Trump’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  In a June 2019 email exchange with Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Jeffrey Epstein wrote, “prince andrew and trump today.. Tooo [sic] funny.” And then he added, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago [sic].”\n \n\n   \n  Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u [sic] the connective tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly Bannon meant by the message. Trump  fired him from the White House  in 2017, though Bannon remained influential in conservative politics as he does today.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Andrew  socialized together  in the 1990s and 2000s, per newspaper reports, alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sometimes at Mar-A-Lago. King Charles  stripped Andrew of his prince title  in October.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Bannon for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein said he ‘gave’ his young girlfriend to Trump in the 1990s. Trump has denied wrongdoing\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Aaron Blake \n \n\n   \n  Many of the exchanges from the emails feature people implying Epstein had damaging information about Trump and suggesting that he go public with it.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein generally didn’t engage with these suggestions. But at one point in late 2015, he told a New York Times reporter that he could produce “photos [sic] of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  Later in the same email string, Epstein also alluded to a woman he claimed both he and Trump had dated in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  “my 20 year old girlfriend in 1993, , that after two years i gave to donald,” Epstein said, linking to a webpage featuring the woman.\n \n\n   \n  A previously published lewd 2003 birthday album for Epstein’s 50th birthday alluded to a similar situation. It included a joke about Epstein having  sold “a ‘fully depreciated’ woman to Donald Trump.” \n \n\n   \n  Trump says the documents are a “hoax” and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/style/escaramuza-cowgirl-fashion-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:56:00-04:00","title":"Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Escaramuza, an all-female equestrian sport from Mexico, has long challenged gender norms in a historically male-dominated equestrian culture.

But the job isn’t done \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:56 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What does a cowgirl look like? For some, the question may call forth images of flanneled shirts, Stetson hats and bootcut jeans. But in escaramuza, the all-female equestrian sport imported by the US from Mexico, the answer is a little different.\n \n\n   \n  Before every escaramuza competition, each team lines up to have its uniforms measured. Strict guidelines dictate that the riders’ tiered Victoriana dresses, often vivid in color and trimmed with lace, must be long enough to cover their horses’ haunches. Glitter and beading are prohibited, but any accessories from earrings to brooches must match. Boots, too, should be identical throughout a team. Under each dress is a petticoat layer, as well as a pair of bloomers — both are to be steamed. One missing underlayer can disqualify the entire squad.\n \n\n   \n  Once they have passed their inspection, these spectacularly clad women go on to perform an elaborate synchronized routine while riding side-saddle. Their frothing dresses become fast-moving flurries of pink, purple and sky blue as they gallop across the arena.\n \n\n   \n  Photographer Constance Jaeggi spent the best part of two years traveling across the US to California, Texas, Idaho, Colorado, Oregon and Washington D.C. photographing these women, first for an exhibition at The National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, and later for the upcoming book “ Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home .”\n \n\n   \n  This visual clash — the strong, muscular horse working beneath layers of delicate petticoats — is one beloved by fashion. Dior’s former designer Maria Grazia Chiuri was inspired by the traditional costume of escaramuza, as seen via the brand’s 2019 Cruise runway show; while the September 2025 issue of Vogue, featured self-described horse girls Kendal Jenner and Gigi Hadid atop great steeds in lacy McQueen dresses.\n \n\n   \n  Jaeggi hopes people will come for her vibrant portraits of beautifully dressed women, and stay for a more layered and complex story about feminism, immigration and personal sacrifice. “I think the fashion aspect of it is the easy entry point,” Jaeggi said in a video interview.\n \n\n   \n  Along with taking their photograph, Jaeggi would watch hours of team rehearsals and often ate dinner with her subjects in their home. She interviewed the women and passed along their recorded conversations to Mexican-American writers Ire’ne Lara Silva, the 2023 Texas State Poet Laureate, and Angelina Sáenz, who wrote 15 accompanying poems each in both Spanish and English. The result is a tale of two halves — the calm, predictable waters of Jaeggi’s images, versus a tense storm brewing in the words of the poets.\n \n\n   \n   “When I started researching and speaking to the escaramuza, I realized how important the oral histories were to their story,” she said. Jaeggi was also “hyper aware” of the fact that she isn’t Mexican-American herself. “I don’t have that cultural, personal connection and I felt it was important to make sure that was a major part of the work.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead of visiting the sport’s home country, Jaeggi was instead drawn to the women who were working hard to establish escaramuza in the US. “In Mexico, it really is the sport of the wealthy,” she said. But the performers she met, most of them first or second generation immigrants, told a different story. From bake sales to fund the cost of the extravagant, hand-made dresses for competitions (the gowns cost roughly $300 to $400 each and are imported across the Mexican border) to putting gas in each others cars, the teams Jaeggi met were financially interdependent communities with one shared goal: furthering their athletic craft.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the stories I kept hearing was that it took them years, like a couple of generations, to be able to afford to have horses and to be able to do this sport,” she said. “It made it even more impressive to me, the fact that they dedicate so many of their resources to it.” When discussions moved onto the topic of immigration “there was some hesitance” for women to go on the record, Jaeggi said, because they were undocumented. That was in 2023 — before President Trump’s mission of  mass deportation  and deployment of ICE. “It’s a difficult political climate right now,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout Jaeggi’s book, there is an undercurrent of inequality that regularly bubbles to the surface. Escaramuza is a five- to 10-minute drop in the three-hour ocean of traditional charrería — the exclusively male ranching and horsemanship competition that is also Mexico’s national sport. Charrería was declared as Mexico’s national sport in 1933, though women were only allowed to perform as an entertaining half-time show in 1953. Escaramuza was not recognized as an athletic competitive event until 1992. Even today, the uniforms of male riders are not inspected as rigorously as their female counterparts, Jaeggi notes, a reason she coyly attributes to “interesting gender dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  While the women are eager to maintain their traditions and culture, they feel weighed down by the sport’s strict, essentialist views on gender. It’s a knotty back-and-forth that mostly comes through in writing. “Women/Are second class citizens in this sport,” reads one line of a Sáenz poem, “You are prettier when you are quiet.” In another work, “Machetona,” Silva interprets the struggle of a lesbian teammate who tries to rally against the inherent misogyny of escaramuza. The history of side-saddle, for example, comes from the fear that riding astride risks breaking a woman’s hymen, compromising the evidence of her virginity and, therefore, her value.\n \n\n   \n  “When it came to issues around gender and feminism, and pushing against some of these gender boundaries, I think most women were really willing to talk about it,” Jaeggi said. “They felt like their voices weren’t always heard in their community, and so there was a lot of frustration that was coming out. Those were really great conversations.”\n \n\n   \n  In “The Poetics of Home,” pride and frustration are intermingled in equal parts. But all can agree that an imperfect community is better than none. The “sisterhood,” as escaramuza is often referred to in the book, gives these women purpose, direction and a sense of belonging. “A sisterhood/Born of struggling and dreaming and training,” reads Silva’s poem “Lo Nuestro.” And as much as this sport is rooted in heritage, the women competing today have their sights set on the future. Jaeggi remembers a conversation with an escaramuza rider, who told her that “one of the main reasons she does this sport is she wants little girls, the next generation, to see that as a woman, you too can ride a horse.”\n \n\n   \n  “For a long time within charrería they weren’t,” she said. “The thought of having a woman compete alongside a man, or ride alongside a man on a horse, was unthinkable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities are planning to deport 89 sick Palestinian patients—many with chronic or life-threatening conditions—from East Jerusalem back to Gaza, despite the fact that Gaza’s healthcare system has been devastated, with 94% of hospitals damaged or destroyed.

\nUpdated: \n        6:32 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Yamen Al-Najjar recalls his past life – the days when he went to school and laughed regularly. Today, the 16-year-old lives with his mother in a cramped 6-square-meter room, just large enough to hold a hospital bed he seldom leaves.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is hard. I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities have decided to send all Gazan patients back home next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen and his mother are among at least 89 Gazan patients and their companions due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization has been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients early next week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT about the potential deportation of sick Palestinians to Gaza but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.”\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been update to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/solar-storm-northern-lights-forecast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:14:00-05:00","title":"Millions saw unexpected northern lights, as a wild solar storm unfolded across the world","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of intense solar storms originating from sunspot region AR 14274 caused widespread auroral displays across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, including in unexpected locations like Florida and Scotland.

Millions saw unexpected northern lights, as a wild solar storm unfolded across the world \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:14 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For two nights, dazzling auroras delighted sky-gazers in unexpected places, including in the US as far south as Florida. The cause: dual solar storms unleashed by the sun reaching Earth.\n \n\n   \n  A severe storm was initially predicted for Thursday as well, with the potential for the northern tier of the US to see auroras again in the evening. Forecasters at the National Weather Service’s  Space Weather Prediction Center  now believe Wednesday night might have been the last opportunity for the most intense conditions.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to creating auroral displays, geomagnetic storms can disrupt   communications, the power grid and satellite operations. The Space Weather Prediction Center said it had otified power grid and satellite operators in the US so they could prepare.\n \n\n   \n  The British Geological Survey initially believed the current solar activity could lead to a G5, or an extreme geomagnetic storm — the highest level on the scale. The survey also dubbed Tuesday’s event a “cannibal storm” that disrupted communications and GPS satellite accuracy.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, two Coronal Mass Ejections lifted off the sun a few hours apart,” the survey’s geomagnetism team explained. “The first one was moving more slowly than the second  …  and so the second one caught up with the first one and they amalgamated together by the time they reached Earth. Hence, the term ‘cannibalised,’ as the second one gobbled up the first one.”\n \n\n   \n  Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in geomagnetic storms.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters at the Space Weather Prediction Center believe that the arrivals of the first two of three anticipated coronal mass ejections caused   Tuesday evening’s auroral display.\n \n\n   \n  “One of them packed a much stronger punch than we would have imagined originally,” said Shawn Dahl, forecaster at the center.\n \n\n   \n  When a storm reaches satellites stationed 1 million miles from Earth, forecasters can measure its speed, the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic orientation, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it pointed opposite Earth, or is it pointed the same as Earth?” Dahl said. “If it turns opposite Earth, then activity really quickly escalates, and those storm levels can dramatically increase very quickly. That’s what happened last night.”\n \n\n   \n  The third solar storm arrived at Earth Wednesday afternoon at 2:17 p.m. ET, with solar wind speeds over 2.1 million miles per hour (950 kilometers per second).\n \n\n   \n  But Earth appears to have been struck by a far flanking edge of the storm, meaning most of the magnetic cloud likely missed our planet, according to an  update from the center .\n \n\n   \n    Solar storm disruptions\n \n\n   \n  Among those feeling the storm’s effects is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The company was  expected to launch  NASA’s  Escapade mission  — twin satellites   set to head on a long journey to Mars — aboard its New Glenn rocket Wednesday. But the increased solar activity blocked that launch attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch,” according to a  post by Blue Origin  on social media platform   X. The company confirmed on X Wednesday evening that another launch attempt is now scheduled for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of activity around our sun   sparked the storms. Three X-class flares, the most intense type of solar flare, have released from the sun this week, followed by a series of coronal mass ejections.\n \n\n   \n  The recent surge in activity stems from an active region of sunspots on the sun called AR 14274, according to Ryan French, a solar physicist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  “AR 14274 still has the potential to produce more X-class solar flares,” French said. “However, the region is now rotating away from us, so any eruptions from future flares are increasingly less likely to hit us as the days pass.”\n \n\n   \n  An X-class flare released Tuesday created a large solar particle storm, the largest since 2005, according to the British Geological Survey. Tuesday’s solar activity also created the largest measured geoelectric field since the survey’s records began in 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field can reach the ground, which triggers electricity in rocks and essentially creates an electric field in the ground. “This is usually tiny on the order of 0.001 Volt per kilometer but during geomagnetic storms it can be much larger,” the survey team noted.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, experts documented a value of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, an unusually large number that “has not been recorded before,” according to the geological survey’s team.\n \n\n   \n  Large geoelectric fields can interfere with transformers and may even cause them to shut down or overheat.\n \n\n   \n    A changing solar cycle\n \n\n   \n  The sun has an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity. Heliophysicists believe the peak, called  solar maximum , occurred in October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we are still in a period of heightened solar activity, we are entering the decay phase of the solar cycle,” French said.   “(Although) sunspots and solar flares are fewer during this time, this is the period where the strongest solar flares typically occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up.\n \n\n   \n  For those in areas   with clear dark skies, keep an eye out for auroras, which could dip over the US. In the UK, sky-gazers in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland had a good chance of seeing them as well, according to the survey.\n \n\n   \n  The last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in  May 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  The storm was a historic one, but fortunately it didn’t reach the level of the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire and remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded.\n \n\n   \n  During the May 2024 geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.\n \n\n   \n  Before May 2024, the last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The recent outburst of activity reminds French of a severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth in  October 2024 . Tuesday night’s storm clocked in as third strongest solar storm of the current solar cycle, French said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-trump-emails-boebert-mace-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump is getting pulled deeper and deeper into the Epstein drama","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including references to Donald Trump, has reignited political controversy surrounding the former president.

It opened when House Oversight Committee Democrats  released three emails  newly acquired from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump. This was soon followed by a torrent of other emails, some referencing the president, from the GOP-led panel.\n \n\n   \n  It did not immediately appear that the trove of material created any new legal issues for Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it proved “absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But the explosive content — which included Epstein and his now-jailed accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell discussing Trump — was the kind of gossipy jet fuel that can ensure scandals defy all attempts at containment and significantly worsened Trump’s political predicament on the issue. It was also the latest twist in a story with an extraordinary capacity to tarnish reputations, which, unlike its main protagonist, will not die.\n \n\n   \n  Political earthquakes are now rumbling on both sides of the Atlantic. Washington is on scandal alert. In the UK, the aftershocks just led to the  defenestration of a prince  — Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — and the  dismissal of a lord  as ambassador to Washington — Peter Mandelson — both over their past friendships with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Most seriously for the president, Wednesday’s disclosures raised questions over whether he’s been fully transparent about what he knew about Epstein — a former fellow New York and Florida resident, who killed himself in prison in 2019. At the least, the emails implied Trump knew more than he’s been prepared to let on about a wealthy convicted pedophile who moved in the highest society circles alongside powerful men in New York and London.\n \n\n   \n  In one email on April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight Committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. They accused Democrats of hiding her name because she did not allege Trump did something wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in an interview this year that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Other material was embarrassing for Trump. Epstein called him “borderline insane” in  a 2018 email exchange  with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. In another email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017, a week after Trump signed an executive order banning the entry of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, Epstein said, “Donald is f**king crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  A year later, Epstein wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about him, in an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Epstein also emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and Ruemmler in March 2018.\n \n\n   \n    An overbearing White House response makes the political drama worse\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein saga has dogged Trump for months. He’s tried and failed to shut it down, for instance when he lashed out in a Cabinet meeting in July, telling a reporter he didn’t know why people were still talking “about this guy, this creep.”\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the latest focus on the Epstein affair has underscored why the Justice Department makes it a practice not to release investigative files when prosecutions are not deemed appropriate. Disclosures can harm the reputations of those involved when they are not charged or accused of wrongdoing, or are merely witnesses who provided testimony or were mentioned in evidence.\n \n\n   \n  But incredibly, the latest political ramifications of the Epstein affair were triggered by administration officials themselves, with Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi pledging to release files before going back on their word. That has created the frenzy of speculation over what is contained in the full record of the case.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s left Trump accused of a classic Washington cover-up. As Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw put it in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. “It would make a lot more sense for him to just say, ‘Let’s release the full files and get it all out there and get it all over with.’”\n \n\n   \n  Walkinshaw went on: “Why doesn’t he want to do that? What’s in those files that he wants to allow this drip, drip, drip of bad news to continue?”\n \n\n   \n  Despite new denials of wrongdoing by Trump and his aides, Wednesday’s releases set off the latest overbearing, and frankly strange, effort by officials to quell the drama. In an extraordinary meeting exclusively reported by CNN, top officials met a single lawmaker, Rep. Lauren Boebert, in  the White House Situation Room , a venue fabled for its use in national security crises. Multiple sources said before the meeting that a heavyweight line-up of Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was expected.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting raised the question of whether the White House hoped to get the Colorado lawmaker to pull her name from a petition that will force GOP House leaders to  allow a vote  on releasing investigative files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Boebert later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  It was another stunning twist in a saga that makes the White House look not just clumsy but as if it is trying to orchestrate a cover-up, even as Trump’s aides insist there is nothing to hide.\n \n\n   \n  The Situation Room meeting was just the latest bizarre intervention by Trump’s aides in the Epstein case. In July, Blanche traveled to interview Maxwell, and the Justice Department later released the transcript and tape of her saying that the president had never at any time behaved inappropriately. Shortly afterward, Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, was moved to a far less draconian prison.\n \n\n   \n  Underlining the failure of the latest White House damage-control effort, GOP Rep. Nancy Mace confirmed to CNN’s Jake Tapper that she did not intend to try to remove her name from the discharge petition. “I will never turn my back on other survivors,” she wrote in a text message. “The work is too important. No one believes us. And we never get justice.” The petition got its pivotal signature on Wednesday with the  swearing-in of a newly elected Democratic lawmaker , which had been delayed for weeks by Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n    How can Trump tamp down the controversy?\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s drama was precipitated by the return of the House for the first time since mid-September. The immediate focus on Epstein seemed to reinforce a claim by Johnson’s critics that one of his aims in keeping lawmakers at home during the shutdown was to tamp down the Epstein storm. If that was the case, he only made it worse. The speaker had no choice but to announce that the House next week will vote, against the wishes of the White House, on a resolution requiring the Department of Justice to release files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  One question now is how on earth does Trump — whose  approval ratings  are already dipping fast, and who is struggling to empathize with a wave of economic anxiety rippling across the country — ever make all of this go away?\n \n\n   \n  Time and again, the president’s achievements have been overshadowed by the return of the Epstein case. While it is not clear that this is an issue that will decide many votes in the 2026 midterm elections, it’s a constant distraction for the White House. Questions about Trump’s character and past did not stop him twice winning the presidency. But the Epstein issue is a rare controversy that has caused a backlash with his base, even though there’s no sign yet that it will sever his almost mythical bond with his most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  But on this question, at least, he’s failed to pull the GOP into line. He made increasingly frantic efforts on social media to portray the email releases as all part of a Democratic plot. His efforts failed. Now, the number of Republican lawmakers who back the release of the documents will be closely watched.\n \n\n   \n  Any large-scale Republican revolt against the president in the House vote could be latest sign that his impregnable support from the GOP on Capitol Hill is beginning to crumble, following the failure of his demands on Republican senators to remove the filibuster rule in their chamber, which frustrated him during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And a strong vote from Republicans to release the files might also heap more pressure on Republicans in the Senate to vote for disclosure. “I’ve already had a couple Republicans tell my office privately that they’re going to vote for it, and I think that could snowball,” Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has braved fierce pressure from the White House, told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n \n\n   \n  In another sign of growing tensions in the House, another Republican, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee launched an unsuccessful bid to force the release of all the Epstein files immediately. “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” Burchett said.\n \n\n   \n  This was the latest indication, that, in Epstein’s words, the “dog that hasn’t barked” over his association with Trump is barking now. Everyone in Washington and around the globe can hear it. And ominously for Trump, the White House seems to have no idea how it can be silenced.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/china-iran-chemical-shipments-congress-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:17:00-04:00","title":"US Lawmakers Demand Answers from Trump Administration over Chinese Chemical Shipments to Iran","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. lawmakers, including Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, are demanding answers from the Trump administration over reports that Chinese firms have shipped 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran between late September and mid-October 2025.

shipments to Iran following CNN reporting \n       \n  By Gianluca Mezzofiore, Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:17 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US lawmakers have called for the Trump administration to respond to reporting that Chinese firms are helping Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program in defiance of United Nations sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The call, from Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, follows  CNN reporting last month  detailing what Western intelligence sources said were several shipments of sodium perchlorate, a missile propellant precursor, from China to Iran since the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  These shipments are “indispensable to Tehran’s efforts to rebuild its ballistic missile arsenal following its  12-day war with Israel  last summer,” the congressmen wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s support for Tehran’s rearmament is deeply concerning and provides yet another example of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) willingness to abet authoritarian aggression from Europe to the Middle East,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN’s reporting, European intelligence sources say 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas between late September and mid-October. The chemicals were bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers, the sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries, which analysts say could provide enough chemical for roughly 500 ballistic missiles, appear to show Iran is stepping up the rebuilding of its missile program, which was depleted by the conflict with Israel in June.\n \n\n   \n  They also come as there has been increased concern in Washington about  potential emerging coordination  between China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last month  for talks that resulted in an economic truce de-escalating their trade war.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s latest shipments of these critical chemical precursors indicate that US actions to date have failed to deter it from supporting Tehran’s procurement of offensive military capabilities,” Krishnamoorthi, who is the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, and Courtney, ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, wrote in their letter.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s support “not only increases Iran’s threat to its neighbors but also assists Russia and pro-Iranian proxy groups like the Houthis whose missile programs Iran has previously supported,” the Congressmen said.\n \n\n   \n  The shipments also “contravene sanctions the United Nations reinstated in September that prohibit international support for Iran’s ballistic missile program and development of nuclear weapons delivery systems,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  Krishnamoorthi and Courtney called for the Trump administration to explain what actions it was taking to “respond to the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) continuing support to Iran’s ballistic missile program,” including in coordination with US allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in April  announced  sanctions on a dozen entities and individuals based in Iran and China for their role procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions on Tehran were restored by a so-called snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms.\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n    China and Iran\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the UN sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue,” and may not see it bound by those rules, as such.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a question from CNN last month about the recent shipments, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while he “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporting last month followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew.\n \n\n   \n  Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had  previously been reported , and entities in China,  long a diplomatic and economic ally  of Iran, are also known to use a network of vessels to filter US-sanctioned Iranian oil to the country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/government-shutdown-ends-federal-workers-return","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 43-day government shutdown ended on November 13, 2025, but its impacts remain widespread and long-lasting.

government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal \n       \n  By Jeremy Herb, Tami Luhby, Sunlen Serfaty, René Marsh, Alexandra Skores, Ella Nilsen, Marshall Cohen, Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is over. But hundreds of thousands of federal workers   are coming back after 43 days to anything but normalcy, employees from across the country told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Workers who haven’t received a paycheck in weeks will still have to wait for back pay. Research grants will be delayed. Economic reports are likely to be scrapped. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through.\n \n\n   \n  And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers said that the shutdown has been an exclamation point on top of months of chaos as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and, in some cases, entire agencies since the president   took office in January. The administration  sought to fire  more federal workers when the shutdown hit, but the short-term funding deal halted those dismissals until the end of January.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it’s going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.”\n \n\n   \n  For the American public, the lingering effects of the shutdown could be felt for months or even years to come at the nation’s airports. Meanwhile, those receiving government assistance like food stamps are eagerly awaiting the government to finally get funds out the door.\n \n\n   \n    A slew of backlogs\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers back on the clock Thursday will need to assess how to address more than six weeks of   backlogs. Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee.\n \n\n   \n  A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check   their emails at approved times to look   for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn’t lock down after 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  It was “heart wrenching” to see the emails piling up, the person said, including with desperate pleas from parents of disabled children who filed discrimination cases with the department’s Office for Civil Rights. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency’s testing labs, said one worker at the agency’s   Human Foods Program.\n \n\n   \n  Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said.\n \n\n   \n  And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You’re talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.”\n \n\n   \n  A big focus at the National Park Service will be assessing any damage that occurred to parks during the shutdown, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n \n\n   \n  Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said.   But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, many parks didn’t get damaged,” Brengel said. “But this is unsustainable and everyone knows it.”\n \n\n   \n  At NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given,  CNN recently reported .\n \n\n   \n  Some of the sources CNN recently spoke to said they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by the Trump administration to quietly gut the Goddard campus during the shutdown — a claim a NASA spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA   engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.”\n \n\n   \n    When will employees receive back pay?\n \n\n   \n  When the  roughly 1.4 million federal workers  who have been furloughed or working without pay will receive their back pay may vary by agency. Many have  missed  two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, it only took a few   business days for workers to   be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left   amid the administration’s downsizing efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the complexity is that federal workers are not all paid at the same time since the government uses multiple pay systems, said Stier of Partnership for Public Service.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a huge undertaking on top of a lot of other things that the federal employees are going to have to be doing,” he said, though it should take a matter of days, not weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But   “until we get paid, everyone’s going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben   Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\n \n\n   \n    Effects on air travel could linger for years\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown brought chaos to US airports, and the impact   could linger well beyond  the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more   coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n   In May,   the Department of Transportation said   it would replace the decades-old Federal Aviation Administration infrastructure with a new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  At a Wednesday press conference at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said the software and upgrades the new system requires “would take longer than the three-year period,” originally promised.\n \n\n   \n    When will safety net programs be funded?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown wreaked havoc on the  nation’s safety net programs , most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly  42 million Americans  to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  Just when enrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will receive their  full benefits  for November will depend on where they live. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court  paused  a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending  partial benefits  last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month’s aid.\n \n\n   \n  After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. Some, however, could take up to a week to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The spending agreement signed into law takes the threat of another lapse of SNAP off the table in January when another shutdown could occur: The bill funded several agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, for the entire fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n \n\n   \n  It typically takes at least 30 days for the HHS to calculate states’ allocations and get the money out the door for LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. And he fears it will take even longer this year since  HHS laid off its LIHEAP staff  in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  Federal grants for the roughly 140 Head Start programs – serving more than 65,000 children and families – that were affected by the shutdown could take up to two weeks to distribute, said Tommy Sheridan, deputy director at the National Head Start Association.\n \n\n   \n  The funding lapse forced 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico to close. Other programs have been able to maintain their operations thanks for local and philanthropic support.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the timeline for getting funds to LIHEAP and Head Start programs, an HHS spokesperson said that the agency will “work swiftly” to administer LIHEAP annual awards. Head Start recipients can expect to receive communications that will include a timeline for the release of federal funds.\n \n\n   \n    Economics reports delayed\n \n\n   \n  Economic data released by the government — which is used by business leaders and the Federal Reserve to assess the state of the US economy — has been suspended throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Monthly employment reports for September and October haven’t been released, and neither has the first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Once the government reopens, statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release updated schedules on data releases.\n \n\n   \n  But this is the first time there have been two delayed jobs reports. And it’s likely that October’s report will never be released, as data for the month was not collected, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period,” Leavitt told reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Headed for the exit?\n \n\n   \n  Caitlin Lewis, who runs  CivicMatch , which connects federal employees with jobs in state or local governments, said the shutdown has pushed many federal workers to the exits.\n \n\n   \n  There was a 74% spike in federal workers signing up for the platform during the first five weeks of the shutdown, she said, compared to the five weeks before the shutdown. Last week was one of the platform’s busiest weeks in months.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year.\n \n\n   \n  “People want to stick it out as long as they can. But this is the latest in a deep cycle of instability that is pushing public servants out of the government since the inauguration,” Lewis said.\n \n\n   \n  When the last government shutdown ended in 2019, a USDA employee returned to find dozens of emails from state agencies with policy questions, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her work and how much she is needed.\n \n\n   \n  But the stress of this year’s record-long impasse has forced her to start looking for other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “This has been the worst six weeks that I can remember,” said the staffer, who had planned a career with the government. “I cannot afford to go through this again, mentally or financially.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/house-vote-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00Z","title":"How each House member voted on ending the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives approved a Senate-backed funding bill to end a record-setting government shutdown, with 222 Republicans voting in favor and 209 Democrats voting against it.

Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Pakistan’s parliament approved a constitutional amendment on Wednesday to expand the powers of the army chief and curb the remit of its Supreme Court, a move that critics said had done irreparable harm to the country’s democracy.\n \n\n   \n  The lower house of parliament approved the legislation with a more than two-thirds majority, with only four lawmakers voting against.\n \n\n   \n  The upper house passed the bill two days earlier after the opposition boycotted the debate — an unusually swift passage for a constitutional change. Such amendments usually require weeks or months of consideration. The amendment will become law once signed by the president, a formality.\n \n\n   \n  Army chief Asim Munir will now be elevated to the new post of Chief of Defence Forces, placing the navy and air force under his command in addition to the army. After completion of his term, he will retain his rank and have legal immunity for life.\n \n\n   \n    Military might, judicial bite\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the amendment as a step toward institutional harmony and national unity.\n \n\n   \n  “If we’ve made this part of the Constitution today, it’s not just about the field marshal,” Sharif said, adding that it also recognized the air force and navy. “What’s wrong with that?” he asked the speaker. “Nations honor their heroes … We know how to show and earn respect to our heroes.”\n \n\n   \n  Critics say the changes concentrate power in the hands of the military and the ruling coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Under the amendment, constitutional cases will move from the Supreme Court to a new Federal Constitutional Court, whose judges will be appointed by the government. In recent years, the Supreme Court has blocked government policies and ousted prime ministers.\n \n\n   \n  Opposition lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), founded by jailed former premier Imran Khan, walked out before the vote and tore up copies of the bill in protest, saying they had not been consulted.\n \n\n   \n  “None of the parliamentarians cared about democracy and the judiciary being eliminated. They have voted for being a silent observer whilst the country becomes a banana republic,” PTI spokesman Zulfikar Bukhari said. “Rest in peace constitution of Pakistan.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Death knell’ for judiciary\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts warned the reform could erode judicial independence.\n \n\n   \n  “We are facing completely uncharted territory: a breach in our judicial system the likes of which we haven’t seen in almost a century,” said constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan. “The members slapping each other on the back should prepare themselves for when they’ll be seeking relief from the same courts they have destroyed and subordinated to the state.”\n \n\n   \n  Constitutional lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig said the amendment spelled “the death knell of an independent judiciary,” giving the prime minister and president power to hand-pick the chief justice and other judges of the new Federal Constitutional Court, weakening its ability to check government overreach.\n \n\n   \n  The military has long wielded extensive influence in Pakistan’s politics, but the reforms give it greater constitutional backing that would be difficult to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  “With the amendment’s passage, parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” Baig said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/thailand-cambodia-border-clashes-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"1112-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump’s Thailand-Cambodia peace agreement is falling apart after Cambodian villager killed in fresh clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by former US President Donald Trump and signed in October 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, is collapsing after a violent clash on November 12, 2025, in Banteay Meanchey province, where Thai soldiers reportedly opened fire on civilians, killing one and wounding three.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump’s much-heralded peace declaration between Thailand and Cambodia is falling apart after the two countries accused each other of opening fire along their disputed border on Wednesday, in skirmishes that killed at least one person.\n \n\n   \n  The brief clash came two days after Thailand said it was  suspending a peace agreement  reached between the two Southeast Asian kingdoms, and presided over by Trump, after several Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion while on patrol in the border area Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia fought a  five-day border conflict  in July that killed dozens of people and displaced about 200,000 on both sides of the frontier. Trump had  hailed his intervention  in the dispute as further proof of his ability to end wars, and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n \n\n   \n  An initial ceasefire between the two sides was agreed on July 28 after the US president held calls with their respective leaders. Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Kuala Lumpur in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Thai soldiers opened fire on civilians in a border village in its northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, killing one person and wounding three others.\n \n\n   \n  The Thai military opened fire at 3:50 p.m. and again some two hours later, ministry spokesperson Lt Gen. Maly Socheata said in a statement.  Cambodia accused Thailand of carrying out “provocative actions over the past few days with the intention of inciting clashes,” in violation of the peace declaration.\n \n\n   \n  The same village, which both sides claim, was the site of a confrontation in September between Thai security personnel and Cambodian villagers. Thai police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to suppress protesters, according to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Contradicting the Cambodian version of events, a Thai army spokesperson said Cambodian troops had opened fire toward the Thai side in its eastern Sa Kaeo province at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thai troops took cover and fired warning shots toward the direction of the gunfire in accordance with the rules of engagement,” army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suwaree said.\n \n\n   \n  There were no Thai casualties or injuries and the incident lasted about 10 minutes, Winthai added.\n \n\n   \n  The clash came after Thailand on Monday said it was “halting all agreements” with Cambodia and would explain its decision to Washington after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand. Thailand accused Cambodia of planting fresh landmines, a claim the Cambodian government denied.\n \n\n   \n  Though Wednesday’s clash was brief, it marked a significant reignition of hostilities after Bangkok and Phnom Penh’s peace declaration that included commitments from both sides to de-escalate tensions, withdraw heavy weapons from the border, and conduct de-mining efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he “strongly condemns” the latest clash as an act against international law, and called for an independent investigation into the incident.\n \n\n   \n  “I call on the Thai side to immediately cease the use of force against innocent Cambodian civilians,” Hun Manet said in a Facebook post, adding that Cambodia remains committed to the ceasefire agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought over their disputed border for decades, but the fighting in July was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the border flare-up.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border, and the territorial dispute over demarcated portions of it largely stems from a map drawn up by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony, which Thailand does not accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/americas/venezuela-us-aircraft-carrier-reaction-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00-05:00","title":"Venezuelans voice uncertainty, fear and skepticism after arrival of US aircraft carrier in region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the arrival of the U.S. USS Gerald R.

Ford Carrier Strike Group will support other warships that have been carrying out  deadly strikes  on suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean over the past two months.\n \n\n   \n  Though Washington insists the military buildup is aimed at disrupting the flow of narcotics to the United States, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change, and some US officials have privately conceded their strategy is aimed at removing President Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment is shared by some Venezuelan citizens in Caracas’ El Rosal office district, who say the US should stay out of other countries’ affairs.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems the United States shouldn’t interfere in that way. I think it’s an abuse,” says Noemí Lozada, a housewife.\n \n\n   \n  José Román, a salesman, says that although he feels there is an imminent threat, people are acting as if nothing is happening. “We are not a warmongering country. I don’t think we ever have been, and I don’t think anyone here has prepared for this, nor will they.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Frank Molina, a personal trainer, says he already knows what he would do if the situation with the United States were to escalate to confrontation. “We are Venezuelans and we will die with our boots on, and I am proud to be Venezuelan and I will defend my homeland to the death,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between the US and Venezuela have simmered for months amid the potential for more direct action.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has  reported  that the Trump administration is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside the South American nation. But the administration has also told Congress in recent days that the US did not have a  legal justification  that would support strikes within Venezuela, though CNN has reported that officials are considering what such a legal opinion would look like.\n \n\n   \n  In Venezuela, local news stations are covering the issue closely, though under the watchful eye of the government and with its “official” version dominating the screens. Maduro’s administration closely monitors what is said in the national media, carefully controlling every word and issuing warnings when it deviates from that line.\n \n\n   \n  But online, social media is awash with speculation that a political change is imminent.\n \n\n   \n  And back on the streets of Caracas, some appear receptive to the idea of a US intervention, suggesting it could bring much-needed change to a country experiencing economic and humanitarian  challenges .\n \n\n   \n  “Well, people are quite anxious, but I think most of them are happy … about the arrival of the aircraft carrier,” says an administrator, who CNN is not naming, for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Another woman who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisal says, “We need help from the United States, unquestionably. If not, we cannot get out of this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Others acknowledge that there’s “a lot of uncertainty” but say that, as accountant Margarita Fernández puts it, Venezuelans are “ready and prepared for anything … I mean, for things to change.”\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, the country’s situation and everything makes me a bit nervous,” says painter Enrique Díaz. “But it’s quite unpleasant that we have to go through this because, while it’s a benefit in some ways, it’s also a discomfort for the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela said this week that it was launching a “ massive mobilization ” of military personnel, weapons and equipment in response to the US build-up.\n \n\n   \n  Land, air, naval and reserve forces were scheduled to carry out exercises through Wednesday, according to Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, who described the US deployments as an “imperialist threat.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R.

Ferris, Adam Cancryn, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:16 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed a funding package to  reopen the federal government , officially bringing a close to the longest shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  The final approval came hours after the House voted 222 to 209 to pass a deal struck between Republicans and centrist Senate Democrats that keeps the government running through January and ensures some key agencies will be funded for the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement, which ended a record 43-day stalemate in Congress, will also reverse the mass federal layoffs carried out by Trump during the shutdown. It paves the way for paychecks to flow to government employees, as well as the resumption of critical food and nutrition services relied on by tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday night cast the legislation as a victory over Democrats, calling it “a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was, they tried to extort.”\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t want to do it the easy way,” he said from the Oval Office, attacking what he called “the extremists” in the Democratic Party. “They had to do it the hard way, and they look very bad.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House signing ceremony was attended by a range of Republican lawmakers and capped a four-day sprint to pass the funding bill, after eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to compromise with Republicans amid worries about the shutdown’s widening economic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  The deal guarantees an early December vote in the Senate on the expiring Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made the focus of their demands during the shutdown fight. But a vote to extend the subsidies is unlikely to succeed, a likelihood that’s driven intense blowback across the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  Most congressional Democrats loudly protested the bill in the run-up to Wednesday’s vote over concerns Americans’ health care premiums will skyrocket without the subsidies, with only six House Democrats voting in favor of the package.\n \n\n   \n  “This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote. “Tens of millions of Americans are at risk of being unable to afford to go see a doctor when they need it.”\n \n\n   \n  Back in Washington for the first time since mid-September, Speaker Mike Johnson corralled almost all Republicans behind the bill, despite sharp complaints from some of his members over a contentious provision added by Senate Republicans that allowed senators to retroactively sue the Department of Justice for obtaining phone records during a Biden-era probe – potentially amounting to a major financial windfall for those lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson himself said he was blindsided by the language, and he said he didn’t know about it until the Senate had already passed the package.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked by it, I was angry about it,” the speaker said, though he added that he did not believe Senate Majority Leader John Thune added it in a nefarious manner. “I think it was a really bad look, and we’re going to fix it in the House.”\n \n\n   \n  To win over conservative holdouts, Johnson vowed that the House would take a future vote to strip that language — though it’s unclear if the Senate would take it up. Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas ultimately agreed not to amend the language in the current stopgap bill, since it would require the Senate to return to Washington to vote again and delay the end of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Conservatives like Roy had blasted that provision as “self-dealing,” since it would award senators $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their lawsuit is successful. The amendment appeared to benefit eight senators in particular who had been subpoenaed by the previous administration into investigations into Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, accused those eight senators of voting “to shove taxpayer dollars into their own pockets – $500,000 for each time their records were inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  The House Democrats who voted in favor of the compromise bill to reopen the government were: Reps. Jared Golden, Adam Gray, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Henry Cuellar, Tom Suozzi and Don Davis. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie voted and Greg Steube against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The end of the government shutdown will usher in a frenetic few weeks of work for the House, which has been largely shuttered since late September. As part of the GOP’s pressure campaign on Democrats, Johnson had decided to keep all members out of Washington until Senate Democrats agreed to back the GOP’s existing funding plan.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Republicans and Democrats have just four weeks in session before the end of the year — when those Obamacare tax credits expire. Trump has called for revamping the law rather than extending the existing subsidies, setting up a high-stakes showdown over health care that could carry political ramifications for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Obamacare was a disaster,” Trump said Wednesday night. “We’ll work on something having to do with health care. We can do a lot better.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are plenty of other deadlines, including Congress’ farm bill and a slew of expiring energy credits. \n \n\n   \n  House Republicans are also eager to pass as many spending bills as possible to improve their negotiating stance with the Senate ahead of that next deadline on January 30.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson also faces another hot-button issue: the question of how Congress should handle the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  Not long before the votes to reopen the government got underway, a newly elected Democrat — Rep. Adelita Grijalva — became the critical 218th signature to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release all of its case files related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson announced to reporters soon after Grijalva signed the petition that he will put a bill compelling the Department of Justice to release all of its Epstein case files on the House floor next week – earlier than expected, and after an extraordinary White House pressure campaign earlier Wednesday failed to convince any Republicans to remove their name from the petition.\n \n\n   \n  The effort coincided with intensifying scrutiny over the Epstein files in the House. Earlier Wednesday, House Democrats on the Oversight panel released  new emails that  showed Epstein had repeatedly mentioned Trump by name in private correspondence, and then the GOP-led committee released 200,000 pages of documents the panel received from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/travel/thanksgiving-travel-government-shutdown-flights","dateOfPublication":"1116-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:16:00-11:16","title":"What’s happening with Thanksgiving flights?

Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:16 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. Staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally up to 10%.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports will be frozen at 6%, the Department of Transportation said Wednesday night, since more air traffic controllers are showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain at that level until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “If the FAA safety team determines the trend lines are moving in the right direction, we’ll put forward a path to resume normal operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said Tuesday that flights  could normalize  by Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that airlines will be “OK” for Thanksgiving. He was the first airline leader to suggest publicly that carriers could be back to normal in time for the holidays.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving will be fine,” Bastian said on Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Ramping flights back up to pre-shutdown levels is a process.\n \n\n   \n  “We are preparing for record Thanksgiving travel, with some 31 million passengers expected, and the busy shipping season is coming up,” said Chris Sununu, president and CEO of the commercial airline industry trade   group Airlines for America, in a statement. “However, airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days.”\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week if the government reopens quickly. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:12:00Z","title":"Johnson says House will vote next week on push to compel DOJ to release all of its Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the House will vote next week on a bill to compel the Justice Department to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files, driven by a discharge petition from Reps.

But he had some leeway to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leaders’ suggestion that he would move more quickly than expected to put the bill before the full House is a reflection of the growing sense of agitation among members of his party on Capitol Hill. The House GOP – which is fiercely loyal to Trump – is not eager to take the vote, which goes against the president’s own wishes. But many members of the party are also sick of the months of growing pressure from some vocal members of their own party, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and feel they need to vote in favor of releasing the files or risk being accused of protecting pedophiles.\n \n\n   \n  “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” a frustrated Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters after he went rogue earlier in the day, taking to the House floor to try to force an expedited vote on the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m tired of messing around. The Democrats have had the Epstein files for four years, and now we’ve got it for nine months, and it’s going to be dragged into a bunch of nonsense. Let’s just take it to the floor. Let’s vote on it. Let’s get on with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The congressman’s push was denied because it did not follow the proper parliamentary procedure.\n \n\n   \n  Political pressure over that high-profile Epstein vote roared back to life on the Hill Wednesday, with House members return to Washington after more than a month away.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva’s afternoon swearing in as the House’s newest member delivered the decisive vote to the discharge petition to force a vote, despite GOP leadership’s opposition and an apparent eleventh-hour  pressure campaign  by the White House to avoid it altogether.\n \n\n   \n  As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up on the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require. But Massie and Khanna used the discharge petition because House GOP leadership did not want the bill to get a vote – leaving many expecting they would have to wait seven legislative days to circumvent leadership and come to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  While the floor schedule for next week has not yet been set, Johnson said leadership wants to bring up the measure “as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it. I mean, they have 218 signatures, that’s fine, we’ll do it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The House Committee on Oversight Committee on Wednesday released an additional 20,000 pages of documents the GOP-led panel had received from the late convicted sex offender’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In emails released as part of the tranche, Epstein, whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence over the last 15 years with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit – details seized on by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, however, brushed aside the  newly public details  when asked about them earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a massive distraction by the Democrats while we’re trying to get the government reopened and cover for their mistakes. I find it interesting that the press corps didn’t ask all these questions for four years during the Biden administration,” Johnson said, when asked whether he had any concerns about the new findings.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed by CNN why Congress shouldn’t release all Epstein documents when the president himself has said he supports doing so, Johnson said: “He is for maximum transparency. He said it as recently as a couple of days ago, and I talked to him about it today. He’s for everything coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Epstein-related pressure builds, two more House Republicans — GOP Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Eli Crane of Arizona — said they plan to vote for the bill to release the files when it comes to the floor. Neither had signed the discharge petition.\n \n\n   \n  Other Republicans, however, remain staunchly opposed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a vote against,” Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “My understanding and I’ve looked into it extensively is that the president didn’t like that guy, he had no friendly relationships with him. You can’t control who takes a picture with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/australia-ancient-crocodile-hunting-trees-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Ancient eggshells shed new light on crocodiles that hunted prey from trees","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have discovered Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, belonging to mekosuchine crocodiles that lived 55 million years ago in Australia.

Scientists say they have unearthed Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, a discovery that could shed light on ancient reptiles that may have hunted prey by dropping on them from trees.\n \n\n   \n  The eggshells belonged to mekosuchine crocodiles, a prehistoric creature that dominated Australian waters 55 million years ago — a long time before the arrival of saltwater and freshwater crocs on the continent around 3.8 million years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Paleontologist Michael Archer said mekosuchine crocodiles could grow to at least 5 meters (around 16 feet) long, and some hunted from trees. Australian researchers have dubbed them “drop crocs,” a reference to the feared “drop bear” — the vicious, carnivorous cousin of the country’s beloved koalas,  or so the legend goes .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a bizarre idea. But some of them appear to have been terrestrial hunters in the forests,” said Archer, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who took part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “They were perhaps hunting like leopards — dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner,” ﻿he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A team of international scientists, led by Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont   in Barcelona, dug up the fossils from a rancher’s backyard in southeast Queensland and studied them .  They reported their findings Tuesday in the  Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .\n \n\n   \n  The ancient crocodile eggshells are helping scientists to understand the anatomy of these reptiles, as well as their reproduction patterns and adaptability, the study’s lead author, Xavier Panadès i Blas, said.\n \n\n   \n  “They preserve microstructural and geochemical signals that tell us not only what kinds of animals laid them, but also where they nested and how they bred,” he said   in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mekosuchine crocs are believed to have become extinct in Australia around 3,000 years ago. They may have lost much of their inland habitat due to encroaching dryland, a situation compounded by growing competition with other predators and the dwindling amount of prey, said co-author Michael Stein, a research associate at the University of New South Wales.\n \n\n   \n    A backyard trove\n \n\n   \n  The exact location of the discovery is a small town called Murgon, about three and a half hours’ drive from Brisbane, the capital of Queensland.\n \n\n   \n  Archer said he and his colleagues had been excavating there since 1983, and he could still recall how it all began.\n \n\n   \n  “UNSW colleague Henk Godhelp and I drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The residents “grinned and said ‘of course’” after hearing their homes were sitting on some prehistoric treasures, Archer recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we’ve already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s inherently difficult to identify an extinct species based on   an eggshell, said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist and author of “ The Secret Lives of Dinosaurs  — Unearthing the  Real  Behaviors of Prehistoric Animals.” He wasn’t involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, given that the eggshell was found in the same geological deposits and locality of the only known mekosuchine fossils from that period of time, Lomax said the authors made a solid argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of the key things here is that matching the fossil egg shells and the croc that laid them can provide new information,” he said. “It will help us to understand not only how they reproduced and where they laid their eggs, but the connection may help shed light on the lifestyle of these unusual crocs.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress has passed a bipartisan funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, providing temporary funding through January 30, 2026.

Congress is  moving quickly  to pass a funding package that would end the longest federal shutdown in the nation’s history.\n \n\n   \n  The House is set to vote on Wednesday on a compromise bill after the  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the legislation extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement with Republicans does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the bill, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The bill would provide funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions would continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The legislation would fully fund the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The deal would also replenish SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund would also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many have missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that would require the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/chicago-ice-arrests-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-05:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Illinois Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of 615 individuals arrested between June and October 2025 during the Trump administration’s 'Operation Midway Blitz' immigration crackdown in Illinois.

immigration crackdown \n       \n  By Whitney Wild, Alisha Ebrahimji, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge ordered the release of more than 600 people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to CNN affiliate  WLS , dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, 615 of those arrested must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling, which applies to people who do not have mandatory detention orders and do not pose a significant threat.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, Fleming told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented individuals – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week ruling her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE is expected to continue operations in Chicago. “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” McLaughlin previously told CNN in a statement following  reports  Bovino planned to leave the city soon. McLaughlin cited a drop in street crime since “Operation Midway Blitz” began.\n \n\n   \n  News that Bovino could leave Chicago came shortly after he was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-administration-meeting-house-effort-epstein-document-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00-05:00","title":"Exclusive: Trump administration holds Situation Room meeting over House effort to force release of all of DOJ’s Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration held a Situation Room meeting with Republican Representative Lauren Boebert and others over the House effort to force the release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

releasing Justice Department case files related to Jeffrey Epstein, according to multiple sources familiar with the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the meeting later Wednesday when asked about reporting that administration officials were huddling with GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that show the level of transparency when we are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns?” she told reporters at the press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt added: “I’m not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar confirmed the meeting in the Situation Room included Boebert, who has wanted the Justice Department to release its trove of Epstein files and has signed onto the effort in the House to force the vote compelling their release.\n \n\n   \n  That effort is now in motion after a newly sworn-in Democratic member of Congress provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  After the meeting, Boebert wrote on X, “I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  She later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, President Donald Trump and Rep. Nancy Mace, another Republican who’s signed the petition, had been playing phone tag for the past 24 hours. The South Carolina Republican sent a direct message to the president Wednesday outlining why she’s supporting the discharge petition, according to a source familiar with the message who said it largely mirrored a public statement in which she said: “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”\n \n\n   \n  But both the meeting and Trump’s efforts to talk to Mace underscored the administration’s concerns around the Epstein saga, which roared back Wednesday morning when the House Oversight Committee released more documents it had obtained from Epstein’s estate. (Leavitt said Wednesday the emails from that trove that mention Trump  “prove absolutely nothing.” )\n \n\n   \n  Besides Boebert and Mace, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is the other Republican who’s signed onto the petition from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, to force the vote on the release of the files on the House floor. The pair received the 218th decisive signature from Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva Wednesday afternoon,  allowing the push to force a vote to move forward. \n \n\n   \n  Had anyone removed their name from the petition before reaching 218, Massie and Khanna would have no longer had the support needed to move forward.\n \n\n   \n  Under the arcane procedure of a House discharge petition, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign on, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  The unreleased Justice Department files, which capture years of investigation into child sex trafficking, could include details the House hasn’t obtained.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the White House meeting, one source said it would also include Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi was seen leaving the White House at 1:10pm ET on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The controversy around Epstein and his contacts with other powerful people, including Trump, has divided the Republican Party in recent months, with Boebert being among the Republican House members publicly pushing for more transparency around the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any crime, and longtime Epstein contact and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell previously told Blanche in an interview this summer that she had seen no wrongdoing,  including by Trump.  \n \n\n   \n  At least two women who say they are survivors of Epstein’s abuse were expected to attend Grijalva’s swearing-in ceremony Wednesday afternoon, sources with knowledge told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The House effort to compel the release of the files, should it pass, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by Trump, who has derided the effort.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-discharge-petition-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:38:00Z","title":"The Epstein files petition now has its 218th signature.

Under the arcane procedure, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign one, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joined with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to spearhead this particular discharge petition, but while Grijalva provided the decisive signature, the effort faces a number of hurdles — and the bill is unlikely to become law.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, should it pass the House, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump, who has derided the effort. But the House vote would put lawmakers on the record on the issue, forcing Republicans in particular to choose between siding with Trump or backing the release of files that could shine new light on the crimes of the convicted sex offender.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the steps the House will have to take now that Grijalva has become the 218th signature:\n \n\n   \n    How long does it take to ‘ripen’?\n \n\n   \n  Even with Grijalva’s signature, an additional seven legislative days have to lapse before a member can move to bring the petition to the floor. The week is often referred to as the “ripening” period.\n \n\n   \n  Then, House Speaker Mike Johnson has up to two legislative days to schedule a vote. (But again, calendar days don’t always equal legislative days – the House must be in session.)\n \n\n   \n  That appeared to make the first week of December the earliest the House could actually begin considering a vote to release the Epstein files on the House floor. But in a surprise, Johnson said early Wednesday evening he’d put the measure on the floor next week. As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up to the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n    Can GOP leadership delay or dodge the effort?\n \n\n   \n  If he wanted to, Johnson does have a few maneuvers at his disposal to try to delay or derail the process, including an attempt to table a final vote on the matter or referring it to a committee. But Johnson’s saying the bill will come to the floor next week shows that he wants to bring this up for a vote.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker has previously indicated that if the petition gets 218 signatures, he will allow for a vote. “If they get their signatures, it goes to a vote,” Johnson told reporters last month.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson also called the effort a “moot point” on CNN earlier this week, citing the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein-related investigation and release of thousands of pages of documents.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming the process moves forward, the House would then have to take a series of procedural votes with hours of debate on the House floor before the bill would receive a final vote.\n \n\n   \n  And then, after all that, the bill would still need to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate – a dubious prospect – where 60 votes would be needed for it to advance, if it even got a vote.\n \n\n   \n    Will the Senate consider the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Even if Massie’s bill clears the House, there’s no guarantee it would get a vote in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether the Senate should vote on the bill, the Republican leader said he was “not sure what that achieves.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to force a vote in September on a bill calling for the release of the files, but Senate Republicans killed the measure — with all but two Republicans voting to derail it.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/takeaways-epstein-emails-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-05:00","title":"Takeaways from the new Epstein emails mentioning Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, suggest that Donald Trump had personal and professional interactions with Epstein, including spending time with Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house in 2011 and being aware of Ghislaine Maxwell’s recruitment efforts at Mar-a-Lago.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal government shutdown provided  President Donald Trump  a weekslong reprieve from major revelations about his relationship with  Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  But as Congress looks to reopen the government this week, it’s clear Trump’s Epstein problem hasn’t gone away.\n \n\n   \n  The big news Wednesday morning was that House Oversight Committee Democrats released  three emails obtained from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump . Those emails came amid another huge release from the GOP-led committee of Epstein documents that  CNN is still reviewing .\n \n\n   \n  In one 2011 email, Epstein describes Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” He writes that someone who Democrats identify as an Epstein victim (but whose name is redacted in the released email) “spent hours at my house with him,” apparently referring to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans on the committee have since said the redacted victim who supposedly spent time with Trump  is Virginia Giuffre , one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. (Giuffre never implicated Trump in any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2019 email, Epstein appears to reflect on Trump asking Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to stop recruiting employees from Mar-a-Lago. In the email, Epstein says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2015 email, Epstein writes to author Michael Wolff about how Trump might handle questions about his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  (You can  see the emails for yourself here .)\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The White House on Wednesday said the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But what do these emails add to our understanding of their past relationship? Let’s break it down.\n \n\n   \n    Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and when\n \n\n   \n  There have remained huge unanswered questions about  what Trump knew and when about Epstein’s proclivities . That’s especially given Trump’s explanations have often  proved evasive or false .\n \n\n   \n  The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had “selectively leaked” the emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.\n \n\n   \n  To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein  liked women “on the younger side.”  A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein “ going after younger girls ” at a 1992 “calendar girl” event. Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein’s “swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls” and joking that it was nice of Epstein to “ let the neighborhood kids use his pool .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a “creep” — but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees, including Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago — but he seemed to be  quite reluctant to go into detail .\n \n\n   \n  The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being  recruited for .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he didn’t “know really why” Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation — and was aware of Epstein’s taste for young females — that would seem to raise red flags.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal actions,” Giuffre’s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in  a statement  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre “spent hours” at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell’s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn’t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein’s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump’s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s clear from Giuffre’s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends. “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,” Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses “next to the resort” who needed babysitting for their kids.\n \n\n   \n    The emails undercut Maxwell’s attempts to distance Trump from Epstein\n \n\n   \n  The Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so  despite  her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.\n \n\n   \n  (Trump at the time hadn’t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn’t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn’t explained how this happened, months later.)\n \n\n   \n  And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president.  She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But the new emails call her claims into question.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of Trump’s and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: “I don’t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of — I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.”\n \n\n   \n  But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein’s house, at least as of 2011.\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending “hours at my house” with Trump, Maxwell responds, “I have been thinking about that.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been  called into question .\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significant\n \n\n   \n  We surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There’s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  The timelines are important here.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein’s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently  stripped of his noble title .) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein  seemed to be going into legal attack mode .\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein’s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, Epstein described Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” This is an expression that comes from   Sherlock Holmes mysteries ; it basically means the absence of an expected event.\n \n\n   \n  Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected  news about Trump to have come out?\n \n\n   \n  (Years later, in June 2019, Epstein seemed willing to laugh about it in an email exchange with a redacted individual, who a source confirmed is Trump’s former White House strategist Steve Bannon. Epstein described a meeting between then-President Trump and Prince Andrew at a state visit as “Tooo funny,” adding, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago.” Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u the connective tissue.“)\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of the 2019 email about Trump and Maxwell is also relevant. That’s because it came during Trump’s first term as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump’s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ’s inspector general  said on January 30  of that year that he didn’t have the power to examine the situation. But  by February 6  the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors  as of early that year .\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump “of course” being aware of Maxwell’s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategize about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)\n \n\n   \n  In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to “let him hang himself” by denying being on Epstein’s plane or his house.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I know how dirty Donald is’: Several suggestions about what Epstein knew about Trump\n \n\n   \n  The newly released documents don’t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump’s possible impeachment: “you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.” (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about “the stories you could tell,” according to one of the released email exchanges. After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was “a phony rich person.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos “of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  He also told the person that he at one point “gave” his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.\n \n\n   \n  At other points in Epstein’s correspondence, Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,” Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. “Interested?”\n \n\n   \n    Trump is still feeding perceptions of a cover-up\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s reactions to the new documents Wednesday aren’t going to do anything to tamp down perceptions that Trump is trying to keep stuff like this hidden.\n \n\n   \n  CNN exclusively  reported  that the White House held a Situation Room meeting Wednesday with a key GOP lawmaker who’s signed onto an effort to force a House vote on releasing the full Epstein files, using what’s known as a  discharge petition  – something the White House wants to stop.\n \n\n   \n  That petition got a decisive 218th signature Wednesday from a new Democratic member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP lawmaker, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, later thanked White House officials for meeting with her in a post on X, writing, “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is also reporting Trump has  played phone tag  with another of the four Republican signatories, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. (She later said in a statement, “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”)\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s response to Oversight Democrats releasing emails that mention him was to publicly pressure Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap” on Epstein, Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else …”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional takeaways.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/louisville-ups-plane-crash-victims","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00-05:00","title":"All 14 victims identified from fiery UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fiery crash involving a UPS cargo plane during takeoff at the UPS Worldport hub near Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, killed 14 people.

Adelita Grijalva is finally sworn in as the House’s newest Democrat, paving way for Epstein files vote \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After 50 days of waiting, Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn into Congress Wednesday, bringing an end to a contentious chapter in the US House of Representatives that included a  lawsuit  and  rising tensions inside the Capitol  over her seating.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson  had said  he would not swear in the Arizona Democrat amid the government shutdown until the House returned to legislative session, a delay that prompted outrage from Democrats. The swearing in took place after the chamber reconvened to vote on a Senate-passed bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Shaking her hand on Wednesday, Johnson described the disagreement over the delay in swearing Grijalva in as “some intense fellowship.”\n \n\n   \n  While she waited to be sworn in, Grijalva had been unable to perform basic constituent services or even open an office in her southern Arizona district. Previously describing herself as a “tourist with an office,” she told CNN that up until Wednesday she hasn’t had a working office phone, an office budget or the ability to use government systems. Residents of the sprawling district had been without a vote in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva was sworn in on the House floor to a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona’s 7th Congressional District elected me to represent them,” Grijalva said on Wednesday. “This is an abuse of power. One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing in of a duly elected member of Congress for a political reason.”\n \n\n   \n  Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva become the decisive 218th member in support of an effort to force the House to vote on the release of all of the Jeffrey Epstein case files, an issue that has roiled the House and sparked division among Republicans. Hours before her signature advanced the effort forward, top Trump administration officials  met with  at least one Republican who had also signed onto the petition.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors were in the gallery to watch Grijalva be sworn in.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we the American people,” Grijalva said. “That is why I will discharge petition right now to release the Epstein files. Justice cannot wait another day.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued that Johnson delayed swearing Grijalva in because she would be the deciding signature that would trigger the floor vote and pointed to other instances where Johnson moved quickly to swear in Republicans who won their special elections. Johnson said Wednesday he’d put the measure requiring Congress to release the Epstein files on the floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that’s different about me and the three other people that this speaker swore in in under 24 hours from the date of their elections is I’m the 218th signer,” Grijalva told CNN last month.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has defended his decision to delay Grijalva’s swearing by arguing that she won her race on September 23 when the House was already out of session and had vowed to swear her in as soon as the House returned.\n \n\n   \n  “I really like this lady. She is going to be an excellent member of Congress. She is a great person,” Johnson told Grijalva on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “She may not agree with me, but we followed the custom of the House on the timetable,” the speaker added. “I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn’t missed a vote and we’re delighted you’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  The House has been out of session since September 19, as Johnson put pressure on Senate Democrats to compromise with Republicans and vote to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown dragged on, the pressure on Johnson to swear in Grijalva mounted. Arizona’s Democratic senators got into a hallway confrontation with Johnson over the issue and other Democrats staged protests outside of the speaker’s office. Arizona’s attorney general even  sued  the House of Representatives over the delay, a move that Johnson  dismissed  as “patently absurd” and a bid for publicity.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva filled the seat vacated by her father, the  late Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva , who represented the district in Congress for more than two decades before  he died  after a battle with cancer in March. Running on the strength of her family name, she sailed to victory in the Democratic primary this summer and then defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the special election, capturing roughly 70% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson complimented Grijalva’s late father and reflected on his time working with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I just told her on the way in that she fills her father’s shoes, or she is going to try, no one can. He was giant around here, served a long time, served his state very well. I served under him on the Natural Resources Committee for awhile, admired the way he did the work, he was tenacious. So, she has a proud family legacy, and we’re delighted to have her here,” Johnson said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  When asked on Wednesday, why it took so long for her to be sworn in, Grijalva said, motioning toward Johnson, “that would not be my question.”\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva has been frustrated by the delay in her swearing in and has said the hardest part about delaying her swearing in was being unable to help her constituents during the longest government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve really missed the opportunity to be able to help constituents that are here that need services. So it’s been very difficult to sit it out while people come up to me and ask me for help,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melissa-hortman-death-vance-boelter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00-05:00","title":"Prosecutors turn over 130,000 pages of evidence in the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile case involving the alleged assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as state Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, Vance Boelter, a 58-year-old politically conservative evangelical Christian, was captured after a botched undercover mission disguised as a police officer.

collected against Vance Boelter.

Some evidence, such as lab reports, continues to come in.\n \n\n   \n  Federal defender Manny Atwal said at the status conference that the evidence includes over 130,000 pages of PDF documents, over 800 hours of audio and video recordings, and over 2,000 photographs from what authorities have called the largest hunt for a suspect in Minnesota history.\n \n\n   \n  Atwal said her team has spent close to 110 hours just downloading the material — not reviewing it — and that they’re still evaluating the evidence, a process she said has gone slowly due to the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not unusual for a complex case but it is lot of information for us to review,” Atwal told Magistrate Judge Dulce Foster.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said he didn’t have a timeline for when the Department of Justice would decide whether to  seek the death penalty  against Boelter.

DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/narrow-house-majority-congress-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:16:00Z","title":"Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority shrinks further after Democrat Adelita Grijalva sworn in","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a weeks-long delay, Democrat Adelita Grijalva is sworn in as a member of the House, reducing Speaker Mike Johnson’s Republican majority to 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats.

Adelita Grijalva was  sworn in as the newest member of the House  after a weeks-long delay.\n \n\n   \n  The swearing in came ahead of a critical vote in the chamber to pass a Senate-approved bill to reopen the federal government and put an end to the longest shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats still vacant. Speaker Mike Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote.\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona Democrat’s swearing will pave the way for a highly anticipated vote to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Grijalva is expected to deliver the decisive signature on a petition from GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to force  a House vote  on the release of files related to the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had refused to call the House back into session or swear in Grijalva for weeks amid the government shutdown following her special election win at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker had indicated he would call the House back into session and swear in Grijalva once the Senate passed a bill to reopen the government – which they did earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  One of the vacant House seats, in Tennessee, leans Republican and will be filled by a special election next month. The other vacancy is in Texas where two Democrats have advanced to a runoff. That has not been yet scheduled but will be held early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/dana-williamson-indicted-former-california-governor-aide","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:05:00Z","title":"Former Aide to California Governor Indicted for Alleged Theft of Campaign Funds from Ex-Health Secretary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dana Williamson, a former top aide and chief of staff to California Governor Gavin Newsom and former campaign manager for Xavier Becerra, has been indicted on federal charges alleging she participated in a scheme to steal over $225,000 from Becerra’s dormant campaign account over two years.

It was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n \n\n   \n  The federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson was part of a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra’s chief of staff at the time of the alleged conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Becerra is a former California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra’s dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra’s campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie’s wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n \n\n   \n  When Williamson prepared to join Newsom’s office in late 2022, she arranged for “Co-Conspirator 2” — an unnamed former public official — to take over her role in the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson told the Los Angeles Times that year that she planned to sever financial ties to her company while working for the governor. However the indictment includes details of emails, calls, and meetings between her and McCluskie regarding the alleged scheme and cover-up while she was Newsom’s chief of staff, a position she held until late 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the Covid-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n \n\n   \n  McCluskie signed a plea deal October 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: “Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”\n \n\n   \n  Becerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson faces 23 charges, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the US Attorney’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra’s campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom’s chief of staff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/uk/british-police-maga-influencer-incident-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00-05:00","title":"British Police Want to Speak to a MAGA Influencer and Partner After London Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British police have issued a public appeal to speak to Melissa Rein Lively, a Trump-supporting influencer and head of America First PR, and her partner Philipp Ostermann, a German private equity investor, following a racially aggravated incident at Bond Street Tube station in London on October 11, 2025.

mentioned Trump multiple times in private emails, new release shows \n       \n  By Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:29 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence that began almost 15 years ago with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit, according to newly released emails from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  The emails to longtime Epstein associate  Ghislaine Maxwell , who was convicted of sex trafficking after Epstein’s death, and the author Michael Wolff include conversations in which Epstein asserts Trump spent significant time with a woman whom Oversight Democrats describe as a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking. The emails also include a message in which Epstein asserts Trump “knew about the girls” — seemingly in reference to Trump’s  claim that he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club  for poaching young women who worked there, according to the newly released emails.\n \n\n   \n  The emails were released Wednesday morning by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which obtained them after  subpoenaing Epstein’s estate earlier this year , hours before the GOP-led panel released thousands more documents from the estate. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predated his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and the White House on Wednesday cast the issue as a “hoax” with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, Giuffre writes that her father, who was maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, got her a job as a locker room attendant. She wrote: “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. ‘Do you like kids?’ he asked. ‘Do you babysit at all?’ He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends, many of whom had children who needed tending.”\n \n\n   \n  She does not accuse Trump of wrongdoing in the book, “Nobody’s Girl.”\n \n\n   \n  About three years before the email – in June 2008 – Epstein had been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison after pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was released from prison in July 2009, having served just 13 months. Years later, his plea deal would face media scrutiny, including from the Miami Herald, and face widespread  criticism as being too lenient .\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in  an interview earlier this year  that she “never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings.\n \n\n   \n  “The President was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny amid a political firestorm in Washington over whether and when the federal government will release its files on the late sex trafficker who  died in prison in 2019 . The  controversy heated up earlier this year  when Trump’s own Justice Department declared that it  stood by its previous conclusion that Epstein died by suicide  and that it did not plan to provide any more information on the case.\n \n\n   \n  That sparked an outcry in Congress and among  some members of Trump’s own MAGA base , and it breathed life into efforts to pry loose new information. The House Oversight Committee successfully sought materials from the estate, and there is a separate effort underway in Congress to force a vote on compelling the release of more files from the US government. That effort received a critical, 218th supporter when  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  signed the discharge petition after being sworn in Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Wednesday criticized Democrats on the House Oversight Committee for releasing the messages, claiming the members “selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump’s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump echoed those criticisms in a series of Truth Social posts Wednesday afternoon, accusing of Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” and issuing a warning to Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” he added, as several GOP lawmakers have signed onto the House push to force a vote compelling the release of the Justice Department’s files related to Epstein. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term and about seven months before Epstein died by suicide in prison.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In her interview with Blanche, Maxwell denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the US president has denied any wrongdoing. He  filed a libel lawsuit  against the publisher of the Wall Street Journal and reporters who wrote  a story  about a  collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003 , including a note bearing Trump’s name and an outline of a naked woman.\n \n\n   \n  In a third email released by the Oversight committee and viewed by CNN Wednesday, Wolff — who published a book on Trump’s West Wing in 2018 — wrote Epstein with the subject line “heads up” on December 15, 2015. That was the day of a CNN Republican primary debate, but there is no mention of Epstein in the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you–either on air or in scrum afterwards,” Wolff reportedly wrote to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein, according to the email, responded, “if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff answered, “I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff has indicated publicly that he has interviewed Epstein, and The Daily Beast has reported it obtained recordings in which Epstein spoke at length to the author about Trump and claimed the two were close friends. Trump’s camp has called the recordings “false smears,” according to  the Daily Beast .\n \n\n   \n  Following the House Oversight Democrats’ release of the emails with Wolff and Maxwell, the GOP-led panel released an additional 20,000 pages it had received from Epstein’s estate, including messages where Epstein criticized his onetime friend after Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald is f**king crazy,” Epstein wrote in one January 2017 email to a New York Times reporter, one week after Trump’s inauguration. In another December 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, he called the president “borderline insane.” That same month he emailed former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior.\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power,” he wrote. “tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler, who did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, and Epstein were corresponding at the time. But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:35:00Z","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a worsening crisis in U.S. aviation operations due to a government shutdown, which has led to air traffic controllers missing paychecks and the FAA issuing an emergency order to reduce flights by 6% at 40 airports.

Less than 24 hours later, the air outside  Islamabad’s  judicial complex was thick with the aftermath of a suicide bomb.\n \n\n   \n  The two deadly attacks are separate, and no evidence currently links the two. But for the two South Asian rivals, the political shockwave caused by the blasts are a stark reminder of the  lingering security issues  that fester below the surface throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  Explosions in their heavily fortified capitals are a rarity, and two in as many days have put officials in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan on edge, potentially  reigniting a cycle  of suspicion and blame after what has already been a tense year for all countries.\n \n\n   \n  A suicide bombing in Islamabad on Tuesday killed at least 12 people and injured 20 more, marking the deadliest such attack to strike the Pakistani capital in nearly two decades. It came just a day after a rare car explosion tore through a historic Delhi neighborhood, killing at least 10 and leaving more than a dozen wounded.\n \n\n   \n  The twin tragedies have handed political hardliners in both New Delhi and Islamabad a potent weapon, ratcheting up domestic pressure on each government to act decisively.\n \n\n   \n  The blame game ignited almost immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, without providing evidence, accused “Indian terrorist proxies” for the Islamabad attack, claiming it was “backed by India” from Afghan soil. New Delhi fired back, rejecting the “baseless and unfounded allegations” as “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the Delhi blast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring “all those responsible… to justice.” On Wednesday, the Indian government  called  the explosion a “terrorist incident,” which was “perpetrated by anti-national forces.”\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi has not named Pakistan in connection with the explosion, and authorities have so far remained tight lipped as to who they believe might be responsible. But in past attacks, India has frequently  pointed the finger  at Islamabad, which is what makes this week’s twin attacks potentially fraught.\n \n\n   \n  “We are witnessing an increasingly fragile security environment across South Asia,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “South Asia cannot afford further confrontation; the region is being held together by fragile ceasefires with no long-term resolution. What’s needed now is restraint, reflection, and a commitment to reset the regional course toward stability.”\n \n\n   \n    Secure capitals\n \n\n   \n  While both India and Pakistan have historically faced significant security threats, their capitals are meant to be fortresses – home to the seats of government, military leadership, and the diplomatic corps.\n \n\n   \n  In Delhi, the attack struck near the iconic Red Fort, a landmark and tourist hub teeming with crowded bazaars and street vendors. It came hours after police found thousands of kilograms of explosives from a village in Faridabad, a city just outside New Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Faridabad police official confirmed to CNN that police are investigating whether the recovery of these explosives was linked to the Red Fort blast. Police in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been conducting a joint operation across these states, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Modi has  built his brand  on a muscular national security policy, casting himself as the nation’s “watchman” and opposition politicians immediately seized on the alleged security lapse.\n \n\n   \n  “If the country is not safe… if the people are not safe… Questions will be asked,” Supriya Shrinate, a national spokesperson for the Indian National Congress, told local news agency ANI. She criticized the prime minister for traveling to Bhutan a day after the attack. “People… are starting to feel that the country is not in strong hands,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Across the border in Islamabad, the explosion occurred in the parking lot of the judicial complex, an area situated within a district that is home to numerous high-ranking government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan experiences chronic instability at the hands of militants, but Islamabad rarely witnesses such attacks thanks to a heavy security presence with Tuesday’s explosion being the deadliest to strike the capital since 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been carrying a heavy burden and a great distress in my mind,” advocate Jaseem Ahmed Bhutto, who witnessed the attack, told Reuters. “It’s a sense of confusion and concern that if the courts, where every ordinary and prominent person goes and where cases are resolved, are not safe, then who is safe in this city?”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP) behind some of the country’s deadliest attacks over the past decade, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement seen by CNN. The TTP, however, distanced itself, according to its spokesman Mohammad Khursasani.\n \n\n   \n  The bombing prompted a furious response from the government. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif declared a “state of war” and described the attack as a “wake-up call” regarding Afghanistan – a reference to Pakistan’s allegation that militant safe havens on Afghan soil are the source of its problems.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in militant violence since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021, fueling cross-border tensions that recently erupted into the  worst clashes  the two countries have seen in years.   Recent talks  in Qatar and Istanbul aimed at ending the latest cross-border fighting in have made little progress.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban have denied backing the Pakistani Taliban and expressed “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding Tuesday’s attack in Islamabad.\n \n\n   \n  According to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, this year “has been particularly bad” for Pakistan and Afghanistan, “not just in terms of the loss of life of Pakistani soldiers, but many officer ranked personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  This, he noted, is something “the political and military leadership in Pakistan has taken very seriously.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A moment of great volatility’\n \n\n   \n  The cycle of accusations and hyperbole following attacks in India and Pakistan is a well-documented political pattern. And while this rhetoric serves both government’s political needs, it also has the potential to push the countries into dangerous standoffs.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s attacks come “in a moment of great churn and volatility in South Asia,” according to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.\n \n\n   \n  With Pakistan blaming Taliban-backed militants it sees as being   sponsored by India, the situation could escalate, he said. “We’re looking at a potential crisis that could engulf not two but three countries of South Asia: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India,” Kugelman added.\n \n\n   \n  This blame game is fueled by deep-seated narratives on both sides.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Pakistan has accused India of sponsoring terrorism on its soil, claiming that Indian intelligence uses Afghanistan as a base to support anti-Pakistan militants like the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, India has long accused Pakistan of supporting and harboring militants that carry out attacks. Both sides deny each other’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s blaming of India for Tuesday’s suicide attack comes just months after the two nuclear-armed rivals engaged in their most intense fighting in decades: a  four-day conflict  in May featuring clashes with fighter jets, missiles, and drones.\n \n\n   \n  That deadly conflict was  triggered by a massacre  at a scenic mountain spot in India-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Following a familiar script, India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied. Modi  redefined  India’s policy on terrorism in the aftermath, which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered “an act of war.” New Delhi launched airstrikes against its neighbor, which prompted a swift military retaliation from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  According to Humayun, many in Pakistan might have been watching the aftermath of the Delhi blast with “bated breath,” anxious to see if the familiar finger-pointing from India would begin. He highlighted the initial “restraint on the Indian side” as a departure from that script.\n \n\n   \n  But if the Indian government suggests the blast was a terrorist attack, “the public will likely expect something big in response from the Indian government,” Kugelman said. “That said, I don’t think there will be as much pressure on New Delhi.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s principal counter-terrorism body, the National Investigation Agency, has taken over the probe.\n \n\n   \n  As governments separately attempt to get to the bottom of both attacks, the citizens of Delhi and Islamabad are left cleaning up the debris and mourning their dead.\n \n\n   \n  Both capitals had, for years, been largely “insulated from these kinds of incidents,” Humayun said.\n \n\n   \n  That they can now occur in these cities suggest that this type of vulnerability “is no longer just a symptom of the hinterland. It’s coming to major metropolises.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/devil-wears-prada-2-teaser","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:13:00Z","title":"Meryl Streep reunites with Anne Hathaway in ‘The Devil Wears Prada 2’ teaser: ‘Took you long enough’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'The Devil Wears Prada 2' was released on November 12, 2025, showing Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs reuniting in the sequel.

 Miranda Priestly’s not riding the elevator alone anymore.\n \n\n   \n  The teaser trailer for “The Devil Wears Prada 2” dropped Wednesday, and it was just what the world needed.\n \n\n   \n  In it, Meryl Streep as Priestly is seen striding in red heels through the offices of fictional magazine Runway. Before she enters the elevator, she is joined by Anne Hathaway’s Andy Sachs, the assistant who in the first film found her footing – and better footwear – in the cutthroat world of fashion.\n \n\n   \n  “Took you long enough,” Miranda says to Andy, as Andy smirks behind a pair of black sunglasses.\n \n\n   \n  Madonna’s 1990 hit song “Vogue” provides the soundtrack to the less-than-minute-long teaser trailer, a hat tip to the fact that it has long been believed that Runway is based on Vogue and the Miranda character is based on Anna Wintour,  the magazine’s famed former top editor .\n \n\n   \n   The sequel to the beloved 2006 film is in theaters May 1, 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Returning alongside Streep and Hathaway are Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.\n \n\n   \n  The first film was based on the 2003 bestselling novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberger, who had previously worked as a personal assistant to Wintour at Vogue, and tells the story of an impressionable young New Yorker (Hathaway) who finds a job at a top fashion magazine under the direction of a tough-as-nails editor.\n \n\n   \n  During a September appearance on  “The New Yorker Radio Hour” podcast , Wintour joked to the host David Remnick that she “went to the premiere (of the first film) wearing Prada, completely having no idea what the film was going to be about.”\n \n\n   \n  “First of all it was Meryl Streep, which, fantastic,”  Wintour said at the time.  “And then I went to see the film, and I found it highly enjoyable. It was very funny.”\n \n\n   \n  Tracie Thoms, who played Andy’s friend, and Tibor Feldman, who played magazine exec Irv Ravitz, will also reprise their roles in the sequel.

EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focused on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska, and has led to the arrest of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard, on an unrelated charge.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard pleaded not guilty to a false imprisonment charge in court Wednesday and was ordered to be released with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 10 , the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Mother arrested on false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard faces a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She was being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:59:00-05:00","title":"The Last Penny Was Minted in Philadelphia: U.S. Ends Production After 238 Years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Mint officially ended penny production on November 12, 2025, with the final coins minted in Philadelphia under the direction of Treasury Treasurer Brandon Beach.

    \n  By Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:59 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The American penny passed away today after a prolonged illness. It was 238 years old.\n \n\n   \n  The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia, overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach .  President Donald Trump announced via social media in February that he instructed the Mint to  stop making  the once-popular coin, citing the cost of production.\n \n\n   \n  The penny  costs nearly four cents  to mint, more than the coin’s worth. Once valuable enough to buy “penny candy” like gumballs and feed parking meters or toll booths, today the penny lives mostly in coin jars, junk drawers or “leave a penny/take a penny” trays.\n \n\n   \n  Beach said Wednesday that the final coins pressed will be auctioned off and that the actual last pennies put into circulation from the US Mint were struck in June.   \n \n\n   \n  The penny outlived its sibling, the half-penny, by 168 years. It’s survived by the nickel, dime, quarter, and rarely seen half-dollar and dollar coins.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its demise, the penny will remain  legal tender .\n \n\n   \n    Problems despite long planned end\n \n\n   \n  For a coin that seems obsolete, its removal from circulation is causing more problems than expected, especially for retailers.\n \n\n   \n  Some merchants plan to round prices to the nearest nickel, often a penny or two more. Others are asking customers to pay with pennies to help supply. But in some states, merchants could face legal trouble for rounding up or down.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, any savings from discontinuing the one-cent coin could be offset by the need to press more nickels, which costs the US Mint  more money  than the penny.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s phasing out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic,” said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, the company that provides the blanks used to make pennies. “By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”\n \n\n   \n  Weller said other countries that removed low denomination coins, like Canada, Australia and Switzerland, had guidance for afterwards. Not so in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said, referring to the president’s February announcement.\n \n\n   \n    Different rounding plans\n \n\n   \n  Kwik Trip, a family-owned convenience store chain that operates in the Midwest, decided to round down cash purchases in stores where it hasn’t been able to find pennies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” said John McHugh, spokesperson for the company. “I mean, it’s not their fault that there there’s a penny shortage.”\n \n\n   \n  But with 20 million customers a year, and 17% of them paying with cash, the policy will eventually cost Kwik Trip a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just businesses that face increased costs. Rounding to the closest nickel will cost consumers about $6 million a year, according to a July study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is fairly modest, coming to about five cents each across 133 million American households.\n \n\n   \n  And rounding is not a national solution.\n \n\n   \n  Four states - Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon - as well as numerous cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington, DC, require merchants to provide exact change, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the law covering the federal food assistance program known as SNAP requires that recipients not be charged more than other customers. Since SNAP recipients use a debit card that’s charged the precise amount, if merchants round down prices for cash purchases, they could be opening themselves to legal problems and fines, said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for NACS.\n \n\n   \n  “Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” Lenard said. “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, NACS and other retail groups recently wrote to Congress asking for legislation to deal with the questions raised by the end of penny production.\n \n\n   \n    End of a ‘wonderful life’\n \n\n   \n  The penny was one of the nation’s first coins, first minted in 1787, six years before the Mint itself was established.\n \n\n   \n  Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with designing the first penny known as the Fugio cent. Its current form arrived in 1909 on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, when it became the first American coin to feature a president.\n \n\n   \n  But it has declined in both use and popularity ever since. The Treasury Department now says there are  an estimated 300 billion pennies  in circulation. That comes to a bit less than $9 for every American. But most of those coins are “severely underutilized.” So, outcry from the public over its demise has been muted.\n \n\n   \n  Joe Ditler, a 74-year old writer and historian from Colorado, said he still has an old cigar box filled with mostly pennies given to him by his grandfather. He remembers flattening pennies on railroad tracks or souvenir machines in amusement parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he only occasionally uses pennies to make a cash purchase. And he often tosses the one-cent coin in the tip jar.\n \n\n   \n  “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said. “The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”\n \n\n   \n   -CNN’s Danny Freeman contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"FDA Removes Black Box Warning on Hormone Therapy for Menopause, Sparking Debate Over Evidence and Balance","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, announced the removal of the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, a move described as correcting a 20-year medical misstep.

However, experts including Dr. Leslie Cho, Dr. Rebecca Thurston, and Dr. Steven Fleischman caution that the benefits are not universal, systemic hormone therapies (like pills) carry higher risks of blood clots and cancer, and the decision lacks transparency, as it bypassed a formal advisory committee and relied on a selective review of older or less rigorous studies.

Doctors are pushing for balance \n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to  remove the “black box” warning  on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.\n \n\n   \n  By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near  antibiotics and vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Makary blamed the broad   22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”\n \n\n   \n  “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.\n \n\n   \n  Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.\n \n\n   \n  They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a  comprehensive research review  published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.\n \n\n   \n  Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.\n \n\n   \n  After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”\n \n\n   \n    How the FDA pivoted\n \n\n   \n  In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.\n \n\n   \n  After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered   that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.\n \n\n   \n  Women stopped using hormones in droves.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.\n \n\n   \n  “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”\n \n\n   \n  Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.\n \n\n   \n  Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch  most of the black box warning  — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an  expert panel  discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to  a Viewpoint article  co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)\n \n\n   \n  “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.\n \n\n   \n  But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.”  The study  Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.\n \n\n   \n  Makary also didn’t mention   the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of   [hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.\n \n\n   \n  Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.\n \n\n   \n  The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”\n \n\n   \n  In the past, the agency has followed  a very different protocol  when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment   Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency  followed similar steps , including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”\n \n\n   \n    Looking for a more balanced approach\n \n\n   \n  In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.\n \n\n   \n  Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.\n \n\n   \n  Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.\n \n\n   \n  Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.\n \n\n   \n  This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.\n \n\n   \n  “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.\n \n\n   \n  Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.\n \n\n   \n  “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the evidence shows about hormones\n \n\n   \n  All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.\n \n\n   \n  “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”\n \n\n   \n  There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988.  One study  estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.\n \n\n   \n  But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.\n \n\n   \n  Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.\n \n\n   \n  “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”\n \n\n   \n  Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.\n \n\n   \n  Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”\n \n\n   \n  Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent viewpoint  published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.\n \n\n   \n  “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   \n  Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.\n \n\n   \n  She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.\n \n\n   \n  “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-domestic-talent-jobs-h1b-visas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00-05:00","title":"Trump says United States doesn’t have people with ‘certain talents’ to fill jobs domestically","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the H-1B skilled worker visa program, asserting that the United States lacks workers with 'certain talents' to meet domestic labor demands, particularly in complex industries like battery manufacturing.

You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory where we’re going to make missiles.’”\n \n\n   \n  The president pointed to the  September ICE raid of a Georgia Hyundai facility , which saw authorities arrest and deport hundreds of South Korean contractors over their immigration status, as evidence of the country’s need for skilled foreign workers.\n \n\n   \n  “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments come just two weeks after he told reporters traveling with him to South Korea that he was   “very much opposed” to the raid  carried out by federal officers as part of his administration’s immigration crackdown at US worksites.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signed an executive action in September to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas. The move marked the latest in a series of efforts from the administration to crack down on immigration and place sharp new limits on the types of foreigners allowed into the country.\n \n\n   \n  The H-1B visa is a work visa that’s valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments during the interview drew criticism Wednesday from Republican Congresswoman — and Trump ally — Marjorie Taylor Greene, who  took to social media  to write, “I believe in the American people. I am one of you.”\n \n\n   \n  “I believe you are good, talented, creative, intelligent, hard working, and want to achieve,” Greene said on X. “I am solidly against you being replaced by foreign labor, like with H1Bs.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia congresswoman has been a fierce backer of Trump since being elected to the House in 2020, but has broken with her party in recent weeks over health care and Trump’s focus on international relations, which she’s said has come at the expense of domestic issues.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fired back at Greene’s criticisms in remarks from the Oval Office Monday, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins she’s “lost her way,” and is now “catering to the other side.”\n \n\n   \n  In the first part of the Fox News interview that aired Monday, Trump  took a swipe at the nation of France  while defending the enrollment of Chinese students at universities in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually think it’s good to have outside countries,” the president said when asked about enrolling Chinese nationals at American universities.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not the French. They’re the Chinese. They spy on us. They steal our intellectual property,” Ingraham responded.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you think the French are better?” Trump said. Ingraham replied, “Yeah,” to which the president said, “I’m not so sure.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/climate/newsom-trump-invasive-species-cop30-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:31:00-05:00","title":"Newsom calls Trump an ‘invasive species’ and ‘wrecking ball’ in fiery remarks at COP30 climate summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom delivered a fiery critique of President Donald Trump, calling him an 'invasive species' and a 'wrecking ball' for abandoning US climate commitments.

12:31 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom pulled no punches at the COP30 climate talks in Brazil on Tuesday, calling President Donald Trump an “invasive species” and a “wrecking ball” during discussions about the US  absence from global climate action .\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, a Democrat widely viewed as a likely presidential candidate in 2028, is the most high-profile US political figure attending the talks in the Amazon city of Belém. The Trump administration made the unprecedented decision not to send a high-level delegation to the annual talks — the latest move in its sharp pull away from global climate action.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has spent the past year tearing up climate policies, seeking to  strangle clean energy projects , pushing other countries to buy US oil and gas and  withdrawing the US  from the Paris climate agreement. In a speech at the United Nations in September, Trump called climate change a “con job.”   \n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has a history of sparring with Trump, appears to be using COP30 as an opportunity to set out a different vision for US climate action. “I do not want the United States of America to be a footnote on climate policy,” he said at an event Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  He took sharp, personal aim at Trump for abandoning efforts to tackle the climate crisis. “He’s an invasive species. He is. He’s a wrecking ball president. And he’s trying to roll back progress of the last century … he’s doubling down on stupid,” Newsom   said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s stance is handing victory to China, he added. China is dominating clean energy supply chains and manufacturing “because they understand the great economic opportunity,” Newsom said.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom was also asked about the Trump administration’s reported plan to open the California coast to oil and gas drilling, as  reported  in The Washington Post yesterday based on a leaked draft map.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never going to happen. Over our dead body. Dead on arrival. Period. Full stop,” Newsom said. He asked the audience to consider why Trump might be targeting California. “He has no interest in opening up oil drilling rigs right off the coast of Florida, across the street from Mar-a-Lago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House shot back with its own fiery reply to Newsom’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, sent this in response to a request for comment: “Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing! If Gavin Newscum’s﻿   support for the climate agenda was sincere, he would not be attending a climate summit that required chopping down thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest for a special purpose highway. It’s time for Newscum and other countries to drop the climate facade. President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  The special-purpose highway Rogers referred to is a four-lane road built through the rainforest to Belém, which Brazilian authorities say was planned before the city’s COP bid.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also spoke about the need to make the climate crisis more tangible. Talking about average global temperature rises and using terms like “greenhouse gas” makes climate change seem “abstract,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  People can see climate change unfolding before their eyes, he added, referring to the  devastating Los Angeles wildfires  in January, which scientists say were made larger and more intense by planet-warming pollution.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also talked about the need for the Democratic party to reframe climate action around affordability in upcoming elections, pointing to rising energy costs as Trump pulls away from clean energy and an insurance crisis unfolding in the US as extreme weather becomes increasingly destructive.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to talk in terms that people understand … it’s about people, it’s about places, it’s about lifestyles, it’s about traditions,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/kazakhstan-lgbtq-propaganda-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-05:00","title":"Kazakhstan follows Russia in banning ‘LGBTQ propaganda’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kazakhstan’s lower parliament, the Mäjilis, has advanced a new law banning the dissemination of information on non-traditional sexual orientation or pedophilia in public, media, and online spaces, mirroring Russia’s 2022 anti-LGBTQ 'propaganda' ban.

with anti-LGBTQ legislation Wednesday that appears to mirror Russian law, as the country’s president met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  The new measures would ban the “dissemination of information containing propaganda of pedophilia and/or non-traditional sexual orientation” in public spaces, through media or online, the parliament, known as the Mäjilis, said in a

legislation would still have to be approved by Kazakhstan’s Senate before becoming law. The ruling party of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who is in Moscow for talks with Putin this week, dominates the Mäjilis.\n \n\n   \n  Kazakhstan is one of Moscow’s closest allies in Central Asia and the move echoes Russia’s 2022 ban on what it calls  LGBTQ “propaganda,”  which prohibits citizens from promoting or “praising” homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are “normal.” That legislation expanded the scope of a 2013 law that forbade the dissemination of LGBTQ-related information to minors.\n \n\n   \n  Kazakh LGBTQ rights defenders have condemned the proposed legislation and accused the country’s leaders of pandering to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Are we an independent and sovereign republic, or are we a colony of the Russian Federation?” activist Zhanar Sekerbayeva asked at a press conference last week.\n \n\n   \n  “As an educated and intelligent woman… I cannot understand why (lawmakers) allow themselves to violate the fundamental law of the constitution,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups have also condemned the Mäjilis’ ban on so-called “LGBTQ propaganda,” stating that the measures will not protect children and instead will breach individuals’ rights and encourage discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  Seven international human rights groups including Human Rights Watch  released a statement  on Tuesday before the legislation was advanced, saying that it “blatantly violate(s) Kazakhstan’s international human rights commitments, including children’s rights to education, health, and information.”\n \n\n   \n  Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director,  said Tuesday  that the likely ban is “about institutionalizing stigma, fear and censorship,”\n \n\n   \n  “If the Kazakhstani authorities truly want to protect and nurture young people, they should rebuff this harmful initiative and instead reaffirm the country’s commitment to human rights and principles of non-discrimination already enshrined in the constitution and other binding legislation,” Struthers said.\n \n\n   \n  The EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community also condemned the legislation, calling it a “deliberate attempt to dehumanize our communities, justify discrimination, and open the door to further repression.”\n \n\n   \n  “These narratives echo the most harmful pro-Russian ultraconservative rhetoric spreading across the region,” the organization said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/latin-grammy-awards-how-to-watch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:14:00Z","title":"Everything You Need to Know About the 2025 Latin Grammy Awards","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Latin Grammy Awards are set for November 13, 2025, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, marking a shift from Miami.

Here’s how to watch \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:14 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The 2025 Latin Grammy Awards are right around the corner, which means it is time to get those viewing party plans in action.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about watching the 2025 Latin Grammys, including how to stream and where you can see music’s biggest stars walking the red carpet.\n \n\n   \n    When do the Latin Grammys start and how can I watch?\n \n\n   \n  The 26th annual Latin Grammy Awards return to Las Vegas’ MGM Grand Garden Arena on Nov. 13. Last year’s ceremony was held in Miami, where the Latin Recording Academy is headquartered.\n \n\n   \n  The Latin Grammys will broadcast live on TelevisaUnivision’s US platforms – Univision, UNIMÁS, ViX and Galavisión – beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An hourlong pre-show will begin at 7 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Like the  Grammys , the majority of the Latin Grammys are handed out during the Latin Grammy Premiere ceremony, which precedes the telecast.\n \n\n   \n    Who is performing at the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n   Bad Bunny , CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso, Karol G, Marco Antonio Solís, Chuwi, Fuerza Regida and its singer Jesús Ortiz Paz will all perform.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s not all: Pepe Aguilar, Aitana, Ivan Cornejo, DannyLux, Gloria Estefan, Kakalo, Carín León, Liniker, Morat and Los Tigres del Norte will also hit the stage, as well as the Latin Grammy’s 2025 Person of the Year, Raphael.\n \n\n   \n    Who is hosting the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic duo of Maluma and actor, producer and musician Roselyn Sánchez will host. This marks Sánchez’s eighth time hosting the awards.\n \n\n   \n    What’s new at the 2025 Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  There is a new field in 2025, for visual media, and two new categories: music for visual media and roots song.\n \n\n   \n  The former will recognize original music for movies, TV shows, video games and other visual media. For a project to participate in this category, it must feature Latin rhythms or be composed by someone of Ibero American descent.\n \n\n   \n  The roots award will go to the songwriters of new, unpublished recordings that reflect the traditions and roots of various communities, cultures, or social groups, especially those of Hispanic American origin, whether in Spanish, Portuguese or Indigenous languages or dialects.\n \n\n   \n  The best urban/urban fusion performance category also has a new name, and its criteria has also changed. Now, remixes are eligible only if the original version of the song was released within the same eligibility year. The required percentage of urban elements has increased from 51% to 60% to qualify in this category.\n \n\n   \n    Who is nominated for the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  Who else but Bad Bunny leads the nominations with 12. He dethroned producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera – known for his work with Bad Bunny as well as Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira, Grupo Frontera and beyond – who previously topped the list in 2023 and 2024 with 13 and 9 nominations, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Don’t cry for him, though: Barrera is tied with Argentinian hip-hop duo CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso for the second most nominations. They have 10 each.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Bad Bunny, CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso are also nominated in the album of the year category, which is rounded out by Rauw Alejandro, Gloria Estefan, Vicente García, Joaquina, Natalia Lafourcade, Carín León, Liniker, Elena Rose and Alejandro Sanz.\n \n\n   \n  Both Bad Bunny and CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso are nominated twice in the record of the year category, which also features artists Lafourcade, Sanz, Jorge Drexler & Conociendo Rusia, Zoe Gotusso, Karol G and Liniker.\n \n\n   \n  The best new artist category nominees are Alleh, Annasofia, Yerai Cortés, Juliane Gamboa, Camila Guevara, Isadora, Alex Luna, Paloma Morphy, Sued Nunes and Ruzzi.\n \n\n   \n    What is the relationship between the Latin Grammys and the Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud likened the Recording Academy – the governing body behind the Grammys – and the Latin Recording Academy to sister organizations.\n \n\n   \n  While the Grammys focus on the US market, he said the Latin Grammys have different global considerations. “Our voting process is, I would say, identical, but it has some adjustments for the international component that we have that they don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the relationship between the Grammys and the Latin Grammys will grow even closer in 2026. Last week, the Recording Academy announced that all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy as part of its 2025 new member class.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/uk/starmer-leadership-plot-streeting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00-05:00","title":"Rumors swirl of a plot to oust Keir Starmer as the embattled British leader denies attacking his rivals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a political crisis after rumors emerge that allies within his Labour Party are briefing against senior members, particularly Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who has denied any intention to challenge for leadership.

Accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of presiding over a “toxic” culture in Downing Street, Starmer was forced to address the reports that his allies were briefing against senior members of his government.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer told Parliament that he had not authorized the negative briefings against his colleagues. “I appointed them to their posts because they’re the best people to carry out their jobs,” he said. “Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest crisis to hit the government comes ahead of a budget announcement on November 26, when Labour – in order to fill a fiscal black hole – is expected to break a key election pledge by increasing the basic rate of income tax for the first time in half a century.\n \n\n   \n  Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that both tax rises and spending cuts are possible when she lays out her plans for the year ahead, seeking to cut government debt. That would likely spur further attacks from Nigel Farage, whose upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party has led Labour in national polls for months.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer’s popularity went into freefall soon after Labour won a landslide general election victory in July 2024. YouGov, a pollster, said this month that just 17% of Britons approve of the job Starmer is doing as prime minister, while 73% disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  The decision by Starmer’s allies to brief against Streeting, the minister tasked with repairing Britain’s depleted National Health Service, bewildered and blindsided many Labour Party politicians and has raised questions about the prime minister’s control of his governing operation in Downing Street.\n \n\n   \n  “People are flummoxed,” one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. “Nobody quite understands where this briefing is coming from.”\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers are also perplexed by the timing of the briefing. After an unsteady first 16 months in office left Starmer one of the most unpopular British prime ministers on record, Labour MPs had previously signaled that the prime minister would not face a serious leadership contest until after local elections in May 2026, giving his government time to reverse its decline in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the Tuesday night briefing raised the possibility that Starmer could face a leadership challenge after the budget.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Streeting’s denial that he is seeking to challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, a “Wes for Leader” website was created on Tuesday. CNN has asked Streeting’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Rumors of a leadership challenge last swirled in September, when Andy Burnham – a former MP and the current mayor of Greater Manchester – launched an audacious and abortive attempt at challenging Starmer’s approach on the eve of Labour’s annual conference.\n \n\n   \n  Ousting a Labour leader is difficult, however, since any challenger would need the support of 20% of the party’s members of parliament, meaning 80 lawmakers would need to agree on an alternative candidate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/trump-bbc-sue-one-billion-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens $1 Billion Lawsuit Against BBC Over Alleged Editing of Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over alleged defamatory editing in a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?', which misrepresented his January 6, 2021 speech by splicing together two separate statements.

is Trump threatening to sue the BBC for $1 billion? \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:17 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for  $1 billion  over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory”  edits  to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I think I have an obligation to do it … because you can’t allow people to do that,” Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. He said the BBC had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    What is the scandal about?\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK –  the Guardian praised  it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter  to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    How did the scandal originate?\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial position, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns   about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his  Substack . “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n \n\n   \n  Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor,  reported  Sunday   that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n \n\n   \n    Have heads rolled?\n \n\n   \n  Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n \n\n   \n  Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n    What is the BBC? Who owns it?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has expressed disbelief that “one of our great allies” could treat him so dishonestly. “(The) BBC – the government has a chunk of that one, I guess,” he said in Tuesday’s interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  The British government does not “have a chunk” of the BBC. The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter,” which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n \n\n   \n  It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n \n\n   \n  Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n \n\n   \n  More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n \n\n   \n    Is the BBC impartial?\n \n\n   \n  Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences. The broadcaster says it is committed to “achieving due impartiality” in all its output.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that, as with every news outlet, mistakes happen, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n  But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump threatened?\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n \n\n   \n  The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n \n\n   \n    Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n \n\n   \n  It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n \n\n   \n  Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the case being brought in Florida?\n \n\n   \n  In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n \n\n   \n  “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n \n\n   \n    Has Trump threatened media outlets before?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay  $15 million  in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay  $16 million  to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n \n\n   \n  Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-agents-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Gregory Bovino and Border Patrol Agents Plan to Leave Chicago Amid Legal and Political Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top federal Border Patrol official under the Trump administration, is planning to leave Chicago as early as this week to continue aggressive immigration enforcement operations in other cities, including Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans.

sources say \n       \n  By Priscilla Alvarez, Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:30 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in cities, along with his agents, are planning to leave Chicago as early as this week as they eye other locations to ramp up arrests, according to three US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino  has become the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there — first in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his officers are expected to head to Charlotte, North Carolina, then continue to New Orleans, according to two of the officials, who stressed plans are still being finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office “has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began. CBS News first  reported  Bovino planned to leave Chicago soon.\n \n\n   \n    Potential move comes after personal rebuke from judge\n \n\n   \n  The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally  called out  by a federal judge.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, “unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.”\n \n\n   \n  That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is  appealing  the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be  delayed  while an appeals court panel considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were “violent rioters and assaultive subjects.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a “reportable use of force” because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. “In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    President has publicly discussed other cities for operations\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  While Bovino and his team’s relocation is not yet final, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the news Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Greg Bovino’s legacy in Chicago is chaos, criminality, and terror,” Johnson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the grassroots resistance to Bovino that has forced them to retreat,” the mayor added. “Bovino did nothing to make our city safer. He will not be missed in Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  “This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety — this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets,” said a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says.

But it’s only Trump’s latest effort to intervene on behalf of one of his most vocal international supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases which began in Trump’s first term. He has entered a plea of not guilty and maintains his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that the ‘case’ against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political,  unjustified prosecution,” Trump wrote in the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceremonial nature of the role, Herzog has the power to issue pardons. But the request must come from the individual accused of wrongdoing, their legal representatives or a family member. Neither Netanyahu nor any of his close associates have submitted such a petition.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Herzog’s office said that he holds Trump “in high regard” and appreciates his “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza, and the safeguarding of Israel’s security”.\n \n\n   \n  But Herzog’s office also said that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump backs global allies\n \n\n   \n  Trump has weighed in on Netanyahu’s trial several times before. In June, after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he wrote a lengthy post on Truth Social in which he called Netanyahu’s trial a “ridiculous witch hunt,” echoing language he’s used about his own legal threats.\n \n\n   \n  And last month, during his short trip to Israel, Trump raised the issue of a pardon during his address to Israel’s parliament.\n \n\n   \n  Turning to Herzog seated nearby, he said, “Mr. President, why don’t you give him a pardon?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new letter sparked conflicting reactions across the Israeli political spectrum.\n \n\n   \n  Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: “President Herzog, listen to President Trump!”, he said, claiming that the “disgraceful” indictments against Netanyahu “have long since become an indictment against the prosecution itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Opposition Leader Yair Lapid responded to the letter in a statement, saying, “A reminder: Israeli law clearly stipulates that the first condition for a presidential pardon is admitting guilt and expressing remorse.”\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office.\n \n\n   \n  His trial on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust began in May 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of testimony, judgment, and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.\n \n\n   \n  It is not the first time Trump attempted to intervene in overseas ongoing judicial proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  In July, in a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to end their prosecution of another international ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has since been convicted of plotting a coup, saying Bolsonaro was “not guilty of anything, except having fought for people.”\n \n\n   \n  In April, he came out in support of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, when she was barred from running for political office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.\n \n\n   \n  “The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison,” he posted. “It is the same ‘playbook’ that was used against me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/listeria-food-safety-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00-11:00","title":"At least 27 people sickened and 6 dead in latest US listeria outbreak.

What you should know \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:56 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Six people have died due to a  multistate outbreak of listeria  linked to recalled prepared pasta meals sold at major grocery chains, including Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market and Trader Joe’s.\n \n\n   \n  The  warning by federal health officials  noted at least 27 reported cases of infection across 18 states, and health officials said that a pregnant woman lost her fetus after becoming ill.\n \n\n   \n  I wanted to know more about listeria contamination and why it’s dangerous. What symptoms should people watch for, and how is the infection diagnosed and treated? Who is most at risk for severe illness, and what foods are most often linked to outbreaks like this one? And as we head into the holiday season, what can people do to reduce their chances of getting sick from foodborne bacteria?\n \n\n   \n  To help me with these questions, I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What is listeria, and why is it dangerous? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria found in soil, water and certain foods that can cause a serious infection known as  listeriosis . Unlike many other foodborne pathogens, listeria can grow at refrigerator temperatures, which means it can survive and multiply in foods that are already cooked or stored cold. It most often contaminates ready-to-eat foods such as deli meats, soft cheeses, smoked fish, unpasteurized dairy products and refrigerated prepared meals.\n \n\n   \n  For  most healthy adults , a mild infection may cause only brief flu-like symptoms, but for certain people, including pregnant people, newborns, older adults and those with weakened immune systems, listeriosis can be severe. It can cause bloodstream infections, meningitis, or pregnancy complications like preterm labor, miscarriage and stillbirth. Listeria infection is the third leading cause of death from foodborne infection in the United States, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Each year, about 172 people die from infection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms should people watch for? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:   Symptoms of listeriosis often start with fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea or diarrhea. In more serious cases, the infection spreads beyond the gut and can cause severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, seizures and whole-body infection resulting in organ failure. Pregnant patients may experience only mild flu-like symptoms, but the infection can be devastating to a developing fetus.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is listeria diagnosed and treated? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Doctors diagnose listeriosis through laboratory testing, usually by identifying the bacteria in a blood sample, spinal fluid or other body fluid. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary beyond monitoring symptoms, but in more severe cases, antibiotics are required. Pregnant people, newborns, older adults and immunocompromised individuals may be hospitalized for closer monitoring and supportive care. Early diagnosis and treatment significantly improve outcomes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What should consumers do if they have the recalled products at home? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Anyone who purchased the recalled pasta meals should not eat them, even if they look or smell fine. The bacteria can’t be seen, smelled or tasted. And just because someone else has eaten it and has not gotten sick doesn’t mean that it’s safe for you to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Check your refrigerator and freezer for any recalled brands or packaging, and either return them to the store or throw them away in a sealed plastic bag to prevent cross-contamination. Wash and sanitize any surfaces, shelves or containers that may have come into contact with the recalled products. If you or a family member has eaten one of the recalled foods and developed symptoms consistent with listeriosis, contact your health care provider.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: As we head into the holiday season, what can people do to reduce their chances of getting sick from foodborne bacteria? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The high-profile outbreaks that make headlines can give the impression that foodborne illnesses mainly come from restaurants or packaged foods purchased in stores. In reality, only a small portion of cases are traced to commercial products; most occur in our own kitchens, where bacteria and viruses can easily spread through everyday handling of food. Practicing careful hygiene and safe cooking habits at home is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of infection.\n \n\n   \n  Among all foodborne pathogens,  norovirus  is the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness in the US. It spreads quickly from person to person and through contaminated food, especially when infected individuals handle meals before or during preparation.\n \n\n   \n  Frequent, thorough handwashing with soap and water is essential, especially before cooking, after using the bathroom and after touching shared surfaces. Anyone with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or stomach cramps should stay home and avoid preparing or serving food to others until they have been symptom-free for at least two days. This applies not only to norovirus but to other contagious gastrointestinal ailments as well.\n \n\n   \n  Undercooked meat, poultry and seafood are another leading source of  foodborne illness , including infections from bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli .  Cooking foods to their  proper internal temperatures  kills these pathogens: Chicken, turkey and other poultry should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius); fish should be cooked to 145 F (63 C); and ground meats such as beef or pork should reach at least 160 F (71 C). Using a food thermometer is the most reliable way to ensure these temperatures are met.\n \n\n   \n  Cross-contamination is also a frequent problem. Cutting boards, knives and plates that have been in contact with raw meat, seafood or poultry should never be reused for cooked or ready-to-eat foods unless they have been thoroughly washed in hot, soapy water. Keeping separate utensils and cutting surfaces for raw and cooked foods greatly reduces the risk of spreading bacteria.\n \n\n   \n  Fresh fruits and vegetables should always be washed, even if they’ll be peeled before eating. Rinsing under running water is usually sufficient; avoid using soaps or household cleaners, which can leave residues that are unsafe to consume. For firm produce like melons or cucumbers, using a clean brush can help remove dirt and bacteria from the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Proper storage is another key part of prevention. Perishable foods should be refrigerated within two hours of cooking — or within one hour if the air temperature is above 90 F (32 C). Leftovers should be stored in shallow containers so they cool quickly, and refrigerators should be kept at 40 F (4 C) or lower. Freezers should be set at 0 F (-18 C) or below. Food left out too long provides ideal conditions for bacteria such as listeria and staphylococcus to multiply rapidly.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid unpasteurized milk and dairy products, as well as juices or ciders that have not been pasteurized, since these can contain harmful bacteria. Pregnant people, older adults and anyone with a weakened immune system should be particularly careful to avoid these products, as they carry a higher risk of serious illness.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to local and national health advisories. Health departments and the CDC frequently issue alerts when contaminated foods are identified or when outbreaks are detected at local restaurants or grocery chains. Following these updates and checking your kitchen for recalled items can help you act quickly to prevent illness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/media/bbc-trump-board-meeting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"08:31:00-05:00","title":"BBC holds surprise board meeting to weigh Trump’s legal threat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC held a surprise board meeting on November 12, 2025, following a legal demand from President Trump, who claimed he suffered significant financial and reputational harm due to a minor editing error in a 2024 documentary.

And he has used both lawsuits and the threat of suits to win settlements and concessions from other parties.\n \n\n   \n  British media outlets have been consumed with stories about whether the BBC will try to appease Trump, or will stand up to him, like The Times and The Journal have. And BBC News staffers have been questioning whether the 13-member board is up to the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  The board has been widely criticized for responding too slowly to last week’s outcry about the editing screwup\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not clear that Trump has jurisdiction to sue,” media lawyer Mark Stephens told CNN’s Max Foster on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the $1 billion dollar amount is “totally meaningless,” Media Law Resource Center executive director George Freeman told a BBC reporter. Freeman reminded listeners that Trump “has a long record of unsuccessful libel suits.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has a successful recent track record of squeezing concessions out of vulnerable institutions – like Paramount, the parent of CBS News, which agreed to pay $16 million toward his future presidential library last summer.\n \n\n   \n  On the other hand, the appearance of capitulation has been costly for media brands like Disney, which lost subscribers when it briefly suspended Jimmy Kimmel’s show amid government pressure in September. Kimmel is now back on the air and ridiculing Trump again on a nightly basis.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment about the board meeting, a BBC spokesperson referred back to the corporation’s original statement about Trump’s legal threat: “We are reviewing the letter and will respond directly in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/oil-demand-2050-iea-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:12:00-05:00","title":"So long, peak oil: World demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its outlook, predicting that global oil and natural gas demand could continue to grow through 2050, contradicting earlier projections of a peak in the 2030s.

    \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Global demand for oil and natural gas could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following US criticism of its climate focus.\n \n\n   \n  The IEA also predicted in its annual outlook that the world would likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris-based energy security watchdog has been under pressure from the United States for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, the IEA predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Peak oil’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called the IEA’s demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The agency is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor.\n \n\n   \n  In its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the IEA predicted that under a “current policies scenario” oil demand would hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario – which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition – is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals.\n \n\n   \n  IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario had been restored to reflect differing choices governments were making about energy.\n \n\n   \n  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope… we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In the IEA’s “stated policies scenario,” which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.\n \n\n   \n    LNG capacity to soar\n \n\n   \n  Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic meters of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and artificial intelligence growth.\n \n\n   \n  Global investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply.\n \n\n   \n  The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050.\n \n\n   \n  More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n \n\n   \n  But the report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-video-tribute-cleto-escobedo-iii","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Jimmy Kimmel’s Tribute to Cleto Escobedo III, His Dear Friend and Bandleader","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jimmy Kimmel delivered a deeply emotional tribute to his childhood friend and longtime bandleader, Cleto Escobedo III, who died at the age of 59.

have done.\n \n\n   \n  After four American women – the aforementioned trio plus  Jessica Pegula  – competed in the WTA Finals in Riyadh earlier this month, the most since 2002, Fritz and Shelton have laid down their own marker.\n \n\n   \n  The 28- and 23-year-olds, respectively, became the first pair to represent the US in the singles at the men’s equivalent event for 19 years.\n \n\n   \n  You have to go all the way back to 2006 in Shanghai for the last time that happened, when major champion Andy Roddick and James Blake made up the eight-man field.\n \n\n   \n  That year, Blake made an impressive run to the title match before eventually losing out to Roger Federer.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to this year and Fritz returned to Turin for a third time, having been a semifinalist in 2022 and a runner-up last year, while Shelton is making his debut.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his loss to  Jannik Sinner  in the 2024 Final, for Fritz, it was the cherry on top of a career-best year that saw him reach the final at Flushing Meadows off the back of two grand slam quarterfinal appearances in Melbourne and Wimbledon.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt like my level at the end of the year was really good,” says the 6-foot-5-inch right-hander.\n \n\n   \n  “I proved a lot of things that gave me a lot of confidence that I’m really right there and also made it clear as well, the things that I need to improve on … moving forward to try to contend against the other top guys.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘This is where you want to be’\n \n\n   \n  While not scaling the same heights this year, Fritz has still added two trophies to his cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  For Shelton, 2025 has been a year of marked improvement, backed up by a maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto – his biggest tournament victory to date.\n \n\n   \n  All this having finished outside the world’s top 20 last year.\n \n\n   \n  And the rising Atlanta-born star is relishing the opportunity to compete with some of the biggest names on the biggest stage this week.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a big goal for me at the beginning of the year,” he says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that I had my work cut out and had a lot of improvements that I needed to make to be here at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is where you want to be, this is where you want to end your year … making the last push in a place like this with a lot on the line makes it pretty easy.”\n \n\n   \n  And an added incentive lies in both players knowing that whoever performs better on the blue indoor courts of Turin will end the year as the No. 1 American.\n \n\n   \n    Grand slam quest\n \n\n   \n  Shelton, though, is not content with just participating.\n \n\n   \n  He, like Fritz, wants to regularly compete for the biggest and best prizes in the sport.\n \n\n   \n  And that means winning majors.\n \n\n   \n  While in this day and age and on current form it seems hard, if not near enough impossible, for anyone to lay even a glove on the current irresistible force in the men’s game – that of Jannik Sinner and  Carlos Alcaraz  – the American is convinced the stranglehold can be broken.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold claim, considering he and Fritz have combined for just two wins in 22 official matches against the dominant duo.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon’s rationale? Depth, resilience and desire among the US contingent.\n \n\n   \n  “We have multiple guys at the top of the game and we want to be dominant as a country,” he says confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had our work cut out for us to catch up to the women who have been dominating … but we’re getting closer.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been over two decades now since the US last crowned a men’s grand slam singles champion. Only Fritz has come closest to ending the hex.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have a time frame. I’ve said a lot that’s for the media to speculate,” Shelton explains.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s too much talent right now for us not to break through at some point. The media will write article after article about the drought or who’s going to be the next or when is going to be the next.\n \n\n   \n  “I just know that it’s inevitable and I’m just excited to kind of be a part of that surge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Time will tell whether that prophecy comes to fruition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/bees-visual-stimulus-study-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:10:00-05:00","title":"Scientists now know that bees can process time, a first in insects","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study led by doctoral student Alex Davidson and senior lecturer Elisabetta Versace at Queen Mary University of London demonstrates that bumblebees can process the duration of light flashes—distinguishing between short (0.5 seconds) and long (5 seconds) flashes—and use this temporal information to make foraging decisions.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bumblebees can process the duration of flashes of light and use the information to decide where to look for food, a new study has found.\n \n\n   \n  This is the first evidence of such an ability in insects, according to doctoral student Alex Davidson and his supervisor Elisabetta Versace, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London. The discovery could help settle a long-standing debate among scientists about whether insects are able to process complex patterns, Versace told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, it was thought that they were just very basic reflex machines that don’t have any flexibility,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  To reach its finding, the team set up a maze through which individual bees would travel when they left their nest to forage for food.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers presented the insects with two visual cues: one circle that would light up with a short flash and another with a long flash of light.\n \n\n   \n  Approaching these respective circles, the bees would find a sweet food that they like at one, and a bitter food, which they don’t, at the other.\n \n\n   \n  The circles were in different positions at each room in the maze, but the bees still learned over varying amounts of time to fly toward the short flash of light associated with the sweet food.\n \n\n   \n  Davidson and Versace then tested the bees’ behavior when there was no food present, to rule out the possibility that the bees could see or smell the sugary food.\n \n\n   \n  They found that the bees were able to tell the circles apart based on the duration of the flashes of light, rather than other cues.\n \n\n   \n  “And so in this way, we show that the bee is actually processing the time difference between them to guide its foraging choice,” Davidson said.\n \n\n   \n  “We were happy to see that, in fact, the bees can process stimuli that, during the course of evolution, they have never seen before,” Versace said, referring to the flashes of light.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re able to use novel stimulus they have never seen before to solve tasks in a flexible way,” Versace added. “I think this is really remarkable.”\n \n\n   \n  The researchers say bumblebees are one of only a small number of animals, including humans and other vertebrates such as macaques and pigeons, that have been found to be able to differentiate between short and long flashes, in this case between 0.5 and five seconds.\n \n\n   \n  For example, this ability helps humans to understand Morse code, in which a short flash is used to communicate the letter “E” and long flash the letter “T.”\n \n\n   \n    More than ‘just machines’\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear how bees are able to judge time duration, but the team plans to investigate the neural mechanisms that allow the insects to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists are also planning to conduct similar research with bees that are able to move freely in colonies, rather than individually, and investigate the cognitive differences that allow some bees to learn to assess time duration faster than others.\n \n\n   \n  Davidson hopes that the results will help people to appreciate that bees and other insects are not simple “machines essentially driven by instinct,” but rather “complex animals with inner lives that have unique experiences.”\n \n\n   \n  “In fact, they do have complex cognition, this flexibility in learning and memory and behavior,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  This may help people to perceive bees as more than unthinking pollinators, Versace said.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not just machines for our purposes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings also raise important ideas about our own understanding of time, according to Davidson.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s such a fundamental part of our lives and the lives of all animals,” but we still don’t really understand what time is and how we deal with it in our minds, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study is really interesting because it shows that it’s not just a human question,” Davidson said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers reported their findings Wednesday in the journal  Biology Letters .\n \n\n   \n  The study shows “that bees possess a sophisticated sense of time,” according to Cintia Akemi Oi, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research at University College London. Oi was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “This finding makes perfect sense, as bees must carefully manage their time while foraging to maximize rewards and minimize the costs of returning to the nest,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Such studies not only help to understand insect cognition, but also shed light on the shared and unique features of their neuronal functions, offering valuable insights to the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Jolyon Troscianko, a visual ecologist at the University of Exeter in England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the results show that the bees “must be using learning that can measure the length of time.”\n \n\n   \n  The method shows that bees can learn using information from outside their usual ecological context, “which I find fascinating as it demonstrates how this type of general learning can be achieved with brains many orders of magnitude smaller than the birds and rodents that prior work has focused on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Bigger brains are therefore not always necessary to show really impressive cognitive abilities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/pope-leo-favorite-movies-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00-05:00","title":"Pope Leo shares his all-time favorite movies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV has shared his favorite films—'It’s a Wonderful Life' (1946), 'The Sound of Music' (1965), 'Ordinary People' (1980), and 'Life Is Beautiful' (1997)—all of which explore themes of hope, resilience, love, and human dignity in the face of adversity.

horizon (and it’s not AI) \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Creating revolutionary pharmaceutical drugs, testing new materials for cars and simulating how market scenarios can affect banks — these are just some of the tasks that could take months or years to develop, even with the most advanced computers.\n \n\n   \n  But what if that timeframe could be cut down to minutes or hours?\n \n\n   \n  That’s the promise behind quantum computing, a field that’s been studied for decades and has garnered increasing   interest — and investments —  from tech giants  and startups alike.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, IBM revealed its new experimental Loon processor and Nighthawk quantum computing chip, which can perform more complex computations than its predecessor. The past two years have seen   quantum-related announcements from  Google , Microsoft and other tech companies.\n \n\n   \n  Quantum computing could potentially lead to a $1.3 trillion increase in value across certain industries by 2035, according to  McKinsey & Company , and for good reason. Experts believe quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in fields like cryptography, finance, science and transportation, and IBM  says  the technology could solve some problems in minutes or hours that would typically take non-quantum standard computers thousands of years.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s a long road ahead. Cracking quantum computing isn’t a matter of upgrading existing computers. It’s an entirely separate approach to computing that relies on the principles of quantum physics.\n \n\n   \n  “A fighter jet is not a faster Ferrari because it has wings,” said Sridhar Tayur, a professor with Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. “Quantum computing is not just a faster classical computer, because it works on a different principle.”\n \n\n   \n    What makes quantum computers different?\n \n\n   \n  Computers store and process information using a language made up of zeros and ones, also known as “bits.” But quantum computing uses “quantum bits,” also known as “qubits.” Instead of being either zero or one, qubits can behave like zero or one simultaneously and exist in states between zero and one, allowing them to process information much more quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Picture it as a flipping coin, as CNN’s  Anna Stewart explained . Bits are the coin when it lands on heads or tails, while qubits are the coin as it’s spinning between heads and tails, or if the coin could represent heads and tails at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  But   don’t expect quantum computers to replace your laptop or smartphone. Instead, these types of computers are ideal for solving big-picture problems involving chemistry and mathematics, making them potentially game-changing in areas such as health, environmental studies, finance, materials science and cryptography.\n \n\n   \n  BMW Group and Airbus, for example, are working with quantum computing startup Quantinuum to research how the technology could be used in the development of fuel cells. Meanwhile, Accenture Labs, biotechnology firm Biogen and quantum computing company 1QBit are  collaborating on research  related to drug discovery. Quantum computers can compare molecules that are much larger than the ones classical computers can compute, Accenture said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  “The big hope is that a quantum computer can simulate any sort of chemical or biological experiment you would do in the lab,” said Anand Natarajan, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences   at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  Quantum computing could be hugely influential when it comes to cryptography and cybersecurity since it can be used to break codes used to protect data, said Natarajan.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s also a major motivation, to make sure that our adversaries cannot do it and that we have this capability,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The  Wall Street Journal  reported in October that a handful of quantum computing companies were discussing potential deals with the Commerce Department that would provide federal funding in exchange for an equity stake.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN that it “is not currently negotiating equity stakes with quantum computing companies.”\n \n\n   \n    The race to crack quantum computing\n \n\n   \n  But the industry has a wave of challenges to overcome before quantum computing can solve modern dilemmas. For example, qubits are extremely fragile, making them very susceptible to external factors like changes in temperature or light.\n \n\n   \n  IBM’s new experimental Loon processor attempts to address this hurdle by demonstrating that the components exist to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer at scale that can function effectively even when errors are present. It’s an important step because errors are inevitable given qubits are so susceptible to interference.\n \n\n   \n  “If I just vibrate a table, I’ll kill our quantum computers. If a little bit of light gets in there, it can hurt it,” said Jay Gambetta, director of research at IBM.\n \n\n   \n  IBM’s new Nighthawk chip, meanwhile, can run more complicated “gates,” according to Gambetta. Gates are the “building blocks” quantum computers use to process information, as the  National Institute of Standards and Technology  describes it.\n \n\n   \n  IBM is just one contender in the quantum computing race. Microsoft in February introduced its  Majorana 1 quantum computing chip . That chip contains a special material the company says can create a new state of matter capable of producing more stable qubits. Google in December  unveiled its Willow quantum computing chip  that it says reduces errors as more qubits are used and can do in five minutes what would take a classical computer 10 septillion years.\n \n\n   \n    There are still some ways to go\n \n\n   \n  The jury is still out on exactly when quantum computing will live up to its potential.\n \n\n   \n  Natarajan believes we’re still likely a decade or two away.  McKinsey said  72% of the tech executives, investors and academics it spoke with say a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer could arrive by 2035. IBM expects to reach fault-tolerant quantum computing by the end of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  But when it does happen, the benefits could be tremendous.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, in some sense … we are trying to do brain surgery using a spoon and a fork. But ideally, to do brain surgery, you would need far more refined tools,” said Tayur of Carnegie Mellon. “And that far more refined tools (are) one of the promises of the quantum computer.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/elaine-luria-us-house-democrats-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:06:00-05:00","title":"Former Rep.

Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement.

announced Tuesday it is investigating protests that broke out at the University of California, Berkeley, this week during an event held by Turning Point USA, the group founded by slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk that caters to youth on American campuses.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters gathered hours before the event, with some seen in standoffs with lines of police. Several arrests were made by both city and university officers, according to UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof, who condemned any violence around the event.\n \n\n   \n  Both the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force and the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division will investigate what happened during the event Monday, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who oversees the Civil Rights Division.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation will involve “a deep dive into all the potential criminal and civil aspects of this horrific situation, including our concerns about UC Berkeley’s history of not protecting conservative speakers on its campus,” Dhillon said  on X , noting the UC Berkeley Police Department has been asked  to preserve all records  regarding its response at Monday’s event.\n \n\n   \n  The university is conducting its own investigation and will fully cooperate with federal authorities “to identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night’s TPUSA event,” Mogulof said in a statement Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no place at UC Berkeley for attempts to use violence or intimidation to prevent lawful expression or chill free speech,” Mogulof said.\n \n\n   \n  The university spokesperson noted the Turning Point event “proceeded safely and without interruption, with more than 900 participants in attendance.”\n \n\n   \n  At least three people were arrested Monday, the UC Berkeley police department and the city’s Berkeley Police Department told  CNN affiliate KGO . One of those was a student who was released after being cited. Another individual was charged with trespassing and obstruction, according to KGO.\n \n\n   \n  One man seen being taken into custody with a bloodied face was later identified by police as a victim and released. Witnesses told KGO the man was assaulted while selling Turning Point merchandise. Another man taken in custody at the same time was charged with robbery and battery, KGO reported.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to university and city police for more details.\n \n\n   \n  Both Dhillon and Bondi described the protests as violent and blamed  Antifa , the anti-fascism movement President Donald Trump  designated as a domestic terrorist organization  in September. Last month the DOJ brought its  first federal terrorism case  against alleged Antifa-aligned operatives.\n \n\n   \n  “The violent riots at UC Berkeley last night are under full investigation by the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force.

      \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Atlanta mom Amanda James’ heart shattered when her soon-to-be 11-year-old uttered the words: “Mom, I don’t have to have a birthday party this year.”\n \n\n   \n  Her son knew both James, a Federal Aviation Administration airway transportation systems specialist and mother of four, and her husband, an air traffic controller, weren’t receiving paychecks during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “That absolutely broke my heart,” James explained to CNN. “(I told him), ‘That is not for you to worry about.’ I was like, ‘No, whatever you want to do that day, that’s what we’re going to do.’ It hurt my feelings so bad that a coming 11-year-old was concerned about something he shouldn’t have to be concerned with.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s one of the agonizing conversations playing out in the homes of many federal employees across the country as they wait for the government to finally reopen.\n \n\n   \n  James, who is a representative of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, is one of 5,000 workers maintaining FAA equipment, along with 14,000 air traffic controllers, who are all working without a paycheck. This week, a small group of Senate Democrats voted  with Republicans  to  approve a funding measure  that could  end the longest shutdown in US history.  The measure now advances to the House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, a record number of air traffic controllers took unscheduled time off causing a cascading effect of hourslong delays for travelers. At the same time, the FAA slashed flights at 40 US airports, so controllers who do show up could safely handle the traffic.\n \n\n   \n  For James, who’s been at the FAA for over three years, when she saw news of a deal this week, she said, “I’ll believe it whenever I see it done.” James and her husband, a controller with the FAA for over 11 years, have been through shutdowns before, and have been saving in case another one should happen.\n \n\n   \n    Navigating a crisis within aviation\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the loss of pay for essential FAA employees a “crisis within aviation” as he spoke to reporters at Central Wisconsin Airport in Wausau, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the country from the James family, another married set of FAA employees, both controllers, share the hope that the shutdown ends this week. All of the family’s extra income has been “dumped” into a new home they are building for retirement. The couple, who wished to remain anonymous when discussing their jobs, are close to retirement age but not quite there yet.\n \n\n   \n  They have saved some money, but at one point it seemed like the shutdown was going to go on forever.\n \n\n   \n  “The worries of when it was going to end, because it didn’t look like there was any end in sight: we weren’t sure how that was going to pan out, but I don’t know,” the controller told CNN. “It’s not comforting.”\n \n\n   \n  They worked every day of the shutdown they could, but did take some time off when they were simply too exhausted to work.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is with air traffic controllers, the American people feel that probably most acutely when they’re not paid,” Duffy said. “A lot of them have taken leave. They’re not coming into towers. That has created significant disruption throughout aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy has said some controllers may be calling out in protest, while others could be working other jobs to support their family. Some simply get sick or become exhausted from the stress of not knowing when they will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “We are here to ensure that the flying public is safe and to continue maintaining those standards of safety,” James said. “The added stress of everything going on, you don’t want (that), and somebody who’s distracted mentally or emotionally or financially having to come to work.”\n \n\n   \n  Compounding the unscheduled time off due to the shutdown, it’s also cold and flu season, James said, and many people in her Atlanta facility cannot work right now due to illness.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump demanded Monday all controllers “get back to work, NOW” on Truth Social, recommending a bonus of $10,000 per controller who didn’t take time off during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But for the James family, they presumably won’t get bonuses since they did take time off when the family got sick.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to say we didn’t have to, but unfortunately, we both were sick and our kids got sick… If we hadn’t actually been sick, we would have been at work,” James said. “We don’t like calling out because that can increase the workload for others.”\n \n\n   \n    Making tough decisions for family\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference Tuesday afternoon at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said air traffic controllers will get most of their back pay shortly after funding resumes.\n \n\n   \n  “I mentioned I wanted air traffic controllers to come back to work,” Duffy said. “So to be clear, anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens, they are going to get … 70% of their pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The remaining 30% will come about a week later, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of banking (on the shutdown to end this week),” the controller who wishes to remain anonymous said. “I would have never thought in a million years – 40 something days – that we would have gone like that. It’s not something that’s not in the back of my mind.”\n \n\n   \n  The end to the shutdown can’t come soon enough for the James family either.\n \n\n   \n  It has caused her to put off a medical procedure she needed. Her insurance only partially covers it, she said, and it would take away thousands of dollars they need to survive should the shutdown continue.\n \n\n   \n  James and her husband, who met in the Army, are looking to foster a high school-aged girl, in addition to raising their four boys, and they won’t let the shutdown stop them from pursuing that. James is a licensed cosmetologist and said if the shutdown doesn’t wrap up this week, she’s going to talk to some salons to see what side work she can do on her days off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/japan-takaichi-china-taiwan-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:52:00-05:00","title":"How Japan’s new prime minister has brought China’s ‘wolf warriors’ back out","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has ignited a major diplomatic crisis with China by declaring that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival, a statement that violates decades of diplomatic caution.

warriors’ back out \n       \n  Analysis by Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:52 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the end, there was no honeymoon period.\n \n\n   \n  Just two weeks ago,  Japan’s  new prime minister Sanae Takaichi was shaking hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, relations between the two Asian nations have dramatically soured, with escalating nationalist rhetoric in  China  and even an apparent threat of beheading from one of its diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi, who was elected as Japan’s  first female prime minister  just last month, has become embroiled in a growing row with Beijing over Taiwan – the democratic island that China’s ruling Communist Party claims as its own, and a red line  it has warned  other countries not to cross.\n \n\n   \n  The furor began when Takaichi  told the Japanese parliament  on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan – which lies just 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Japanese territory – would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival” and could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of the island and has ramped up the frequency and complexity of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “ strategic ambiguity .”\n \n\n   \n  Wading into the thorny issue of Taiwan’s defense has gotten other world leaders in hot water with Beijing before. Former US President Joe Biden set off a diplomatic panic during his time in office when he  said multiple times  that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan – forcing the White House to repeatedly walk back his comments, and sparking anger each time in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s remarks were met with an even more vehement response.\n \n\n   \n  “The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” wrote the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  The fallout has  spiraled  since, with Japan criticizing Xue’s “extremely inappropriate” post and Taiwan voicing concern about Xue’s “threatening” remarks, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, meanwhile, has defended its position and Xue’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry on Monday accused Japan of “grossly interfering with China’s internal affairs,” saying Xue’s post was simply responding to Takaichi’s “erroneous and dangerous remarks.”\n \n\n   \n  For some, the controversy harks back to China’s “ wolf warrior ” diplomacy – an aggressive style of foreign policy that emerged in the early 2020s, which often saw Chinese officials take to social media platforms to hit back directly - and often colorfully - at any criticism of China, but has since been dialed back as Beijing looked to win back lost goodwill among Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  And within China, where there is already significant streak of anti-Japanese sentiment, state media and other prominent voices this week have further fanned outrage over Takaichi’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily condemned Takaichi as “recklessly shooting her mouth off,” and warning: “No one should harbor any illusion that they can cross the line on the Taiwan issue without paying a price.”\n \n\n   \n  A social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV asked: “Has her head been kicked by a donkey?”\n \n\n   \n  Hu Xijin, a Chinese pundit and former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times, offered a more violent warning, echoing the threats from the diplomat Xue.\n \n\n   \n  “China’s battle blade for beheading invaders has been sharpened to a very keen edge,” he wrote in a post on Tuesday. “If Japanese militarism wishes to come to the Taiwan Strait to sacrifice themselves on our blades, we will fulfill them.”\n \n\n   \n    A tangled relationship\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi said Monday that her comments were “hypothetical,” and said she would avoid making similar comments in parliament again. But the prime minister is walking a  tightrope  every Japanese leader has had to balance.\n \n\n   \n  China remains Japan’s largest trading partner, and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes.  At the same time, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative views, like her mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity and criticized Beijing’s growing military presence in the region.\n \n\n   \n  This uneasy relationship was on display when  Takaichi met Xi  at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October. The two leaders agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship,” Takaichi said afterward; however, she also raised with Xi the hot-button issue of China’s activity in the East China Sea, including around islands claimed by both countries.\n \n\n   \n  Even before she took office, Takaichi’s stance on Taiwan was clear. She visited the island earlier this year and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. During the APEC summit, she also met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  The current spat comes during a year when Japan-China relations are already strained, in part because of Tokyo’s colonial and war-time past.\n \n\n   \n  September marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Beijing commemorated with a  massive military parade . There’s longstanding historical hostility between the two countries; China was a crucial Allied partner, fighting against Japan’s full-scale invasion that ended only with Tokyo’s formal surrender in 1945.\n \n\n   \n  The scars of that era run deep. Japanese Imperial troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the  Nanjing Massacre  – one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the parade, Chinese officials ramped up their rhetoric and accused Japan of whitewashing history. Adding fuel to the fire, China also released at least  four WWII films this year,  including some that depict the Nanjing Massacre and the sinking of a Japanese vessel.\n \n\n   \n  Fearing a spike in anti-Japanese sentiment ahead of the parade, the Japanese embassy in Beijing warned its citizens to stay cautious and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public – perhaps mindful that in recent years, there has been a spate of  violent attacks  against  Japanese nationals in China .\n \n\n   \n  That complex history involves Taiwan, too.\n \n\n   \n  The island was once a Japanese colony that Imperial China had ceded to Imperial Japan. After Japan was defeated in WWII, China’s ruling Nationalists took control of Taiwan – then, several years later, fled to the island and moved their seat of government there after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n \n\n   \n  Today, the CCP views the self-ruling island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary. Party leaders and state media have repeatedly claimed that the end of WWII marked the island’s return to Chinese rule and liberation from Japanese occupation – a view Chinese officials alluded to this week as they berated Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan holds historical responsibility towards the Chinese people regarding the Taiwan issue, having committed unmentionable crimes during the 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan,” said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday when asked about Takaichi’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Eighty years ago, we defeated the Japanese aggressors, restored Taiwan, and ended their occupation and plunder,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Should anyone again attempt to challenge China’s core interests” or thwart reunification with Taiwan, Chen said, Beijing “will never accept or tolerate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/linda-sun-new-york-chinese-agent","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Former aide to two NY governors, accused of being Chinese agent, goes on trial for money laundering and fraud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Linda Sun, a former aide to New York Governors Kathy Hochul and Andrew Cuomo, is set to go on trial in Brooklyn for allegedly acting as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party.

redistricting scheme could wind up hurting democracy more than Democrats \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump marched the nation into a historic redistricting arms race with his brazen move to get red states to draw as many new GOP-leaning districts as possible.\n \n\n   \n  Already, more states have voluntarily redrawn their congressional maps in the middle of a decade than had done so  in the last half-century combined .\n \n\n   \n  And it was an arms race the  GOP was always likely to win , given the power dynamics involved.\n \n\n   \n  But four months into the battle, the GOP’s gains are looking relatively muted. Indeed, it’s looking like Trump’s move could be much more damaging to democracy — by normalizing these kinds of bare-knuckle political tactics for years to come — than to the Democratic Party in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Appropriately enough for the Trump era, the biggest victim here could wind up being our political norms.\n \n\n   \n  While much remains to be determined, Democrats have benefited from a series of positive developments in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The big one, of course, was the easy passage last week of a California ballot measure that allows the party to  draw five new Democratic-leaning districts  in that state. Gov. Gavin Newsom launched that effort to offset the GOP’s gains in Texas, the state where Trump and the GOP started this war. And California voters overwhelmingly agreed (65%-35%) that retaliation was warranted.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have also benefited from a new compromise  map in Ohio that  wasn’t as bad for them  as it could have been, along with the  reluctance of Republicans in some red states  to heed Trump’s call to squeeze every district they can out of the process.\n \n\n   \n  The election results last week were also positive for Democrats in a few subtler ways.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Democrats greatly expanded their advantage in the Virginia House of Delegates and swept the state’s executive offices, which should help them press forward with drawing more Democratic-leaning districts.\n \n\n   \n  For two, the big swings toward Democrats from the 2024 elections might give Republicans pause about trying to draw too many more favorable districts. The more you draw, after all, the more it spreads your voters thin and risks your districts getting swept up in a wave election for the other side. (Want an example of how that can work?  See: the 1894 election .)\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight is such a blowout so far that I wonder if it gives some Rs pause about redistricting in states that are still pondering it,” Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics  said on X  on election night.\n \n\n   \n  And then came perhaps the most pleasant surprise of all for Democrats, on Monday in Utah. A federal judge threw out a Republican-drawn map and adopted an alternate one that gave Democrats  a new safely blue seat in Salt Lake City .\n \n\n   \n  So where does all this leave us? CNN’s elections team has  a great new tracker  where you can monitor it all.\n \n\n   \n  All told, Republicans have added an estimated nine new GOP targets in Texas, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri, while Democrats have added about six in California and Utah.\n \n\n   \n  The big questions from here are what happens in Florida and Virginia, where each side could gain three or more seats — Republicans in the former and Democrats in the latter. And seats could be in play for one side or the other in Indiana and Kansas (for Republicans) and Illinois and Maryland (for Democrats).\n \n\n   \n  We don’t yet know how that will shake out. Legal challenges loom over some of the states that have already moved or could move. Another major question is whether the Supreme Court opens the door to even more aggressive gerrymandering by striking down part of the Voting Rights Act — a move that could completely change the game in the South and  give Republicans a major advantage . That would likely impact elections held after 2026.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s entirely possible that, for 2026, Republicans could wind up netting about three to five seats total from this exercise. That’s where we’d be if every other state that’s in play actually followed through.\n \n\n   \n  And the GOP’s gains could be even less than that when you factor in how competitive some of these seats could be in a Democratic-leaning election, as  the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman notes .\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Democrats’ gains with Hispanic voters in last week’s elections make the Texas GOP’s hopes of winning two of the five new Republican-leaning districts look more tenuous. The GOP was banking on  maintaining Trump’s big gains with Hispanic voters in 2024 , but that’s looking like a not-so-great bet right now.\n \n\n   \n  And if the GOP nets only three to five seats, that’s likely to have negligible impact on who controls the House after the 2026 elections. That’s because the party that doesn’t hold the White House usually wins lots of seats in midterm elections — more than enough to cover the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Without any redistricting changes, Democrats need to flip three seats. A GOP gain of three to five seats would stretch that to Democrats needing to flip between six and eight seats.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition party has failed to win that many seats only nine times since the Civil War, and not once since 2002, according to  data from the Brookings Institution .\n \n\n   \n  Throw Trump’s significant unpopularity on top of that, and it appears unlikely that his redistricting gambit will ultimately do what he wanted: prevent Democrats from controlling the House for the president’s two final years in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what Trump will have done is saddle the country with a new political reality in which each side is tempted to redraw districts whenever it’s advantageous and  we get fewer and fewer competitive districts , as Kondik wrote last week.\n \n\n   \n  That’s something the American people  decidedly did not want . But it would be part of Trump’s norm-busting legacy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/white-house-website-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"How the Trump Administration Seeks to ‘Weaponize’ the White House Website to Troll Democrats and Amplify Its Message","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is using the official White House website (whitehouse.gov) as a political tool to troll Democrats, amplify its message, and spread misinformation.

Intended to be a source of government information for Americans and a connection to the White House from their homes, Clinton stressed that leaders have the responsibility to use tools like the website “to expand the reach of democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve made the website a permanent part of the Executive Office of the President, so that future presidents will be able to change it to suit their needs as easily as they can change the furniture here in the Oval Office,” Clinton said.\n \n\n   \n  Twenty-five years later, President Donald Trump has done  far more   than just   swap out   the furniture , and the sound of construction is not unusual on White House grounds. The aggressive remodel has extended online, where the second Trump administration has transformed the government website into a tool to troll Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a timer on the White House website tracks how long “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government” down to the second, even as Senate Democrats joined with Republicans on Monday to advance a funding measure. A  “mysafespace”  webpage, in the style of the early 2000s site MySpace, mocks Democrats and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, dubbing him “Sombrero Guy” and “Dollar Store Obama,” while claiming his heroes are “transnational gangs, illegal immigrants” and radical leftists.\n \n\n   \n   And amid public outrage over  Trump’s demolition of the East Wing  for his new ballroom, the administration has added several controversial, and in some cases mischaracterized, intervals to a timeline of White House construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We use it to really drive a message,” a White House official said. “The website is informative in a lot of different ways, but it’s also a vehicle to push our message, and we’re able to weaponize it in a way that no other administration has been able to do.”\n \n\n   \n  But while the second Trump administration’s  social media strategy  has long embraced memes and videos mocking Democrats, former White House officials are raising concerns about the irreverent approach bleeding over to a website previously geared toward historical and informational ends.\n \n\n   \n  And that uproar is part of the White House’s intention – to spread its message further.\n \n\n   \n  “The outrage on the left is great because they’re just consumed with it,” the White House official said. “It’s great for our base, because they’re able to take a screenshot or a snippet of the timeline and post it on social media.”\n \n\n   \n    Following Trump’s lead\n \n\n   \n  The digital strategy under the Trump administration, the White House official said, is to not only follow the president’s lead but to amplify it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s spitballing with ideas on the fly. I mean, a lot of it is what we say, ‘Follow the leader,’ which is what President Trump has done on social media, and just amplify it. And, you know, try to take it to the next level,” they said, pointing to the sombrero memes.\n \n\n   \n  What began with Trump resharing an AI-generated  racist and vulgar video  of Jeffries in a sombrero alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the White House morphed into taunts on social media to increase the size of the sombrero until the shutdown ends. And the meme has now crossed over to the White House website, where on the “mysafespace” page, dozens of sombreros appear in the background, and mariachi music starts playing when users hit the play button.\n \n\n   \n  It pairs with an “About me” section that claims Democrats “couldn’t care less if our men and women in uniform get paid or if our neighborhoods are safe – we just love playing politics with people’s livelihoods.” And if users click on an option for “Contacting Hakeem,” the White House website generates a draft email to Jeffries’ and Schumer’s offices with prewritten text asking to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether there are any lines the White House isn’t willing to cross, the official said, “There’s certainly lines.”\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t do anything that’s overtly political, right? You can’t run afoul of the Hatch Act,” they said, referring to legislation that  prohibits the federal government  and its employees, except for the president and vice president, from “engaging in partisan political activity,” including on social media. The official added, “We’re doing everything within the framework of what’s allowable.”\n \n\n   \n  The aggressive approach strikes David Almacy, former White House internet and e-communications director under President George W. Bush’s administration, as a significant shift from past presidencies.\n \n\n   \n  Almacy said he viewed whitehouse.gov as a way to keep Americans apprised on what the president was doing on a daily basis, contribute to a larger historical record of the president’s entire term and provide “an accurate historical and factual record of the White House as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was very sort of like nondescript, the headlines. There was no political tone to it,” he recalled, adding the Bush administration tried to “adhere to the spirit of the Hatch Act.” “It was never derogatory. It was never meant to divide. It was meant to inform.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think now it appears that mostly it’s being used as a political tool,” Almacy said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Everybody is more unfiltered’\n \n\n   \n  It’s “an outdated view,” a Republican digital operative familiar with the Trump administration’s digital efforts said, to think of the White House website as somewhere that a grade-school student goes to cite a paper, given “there are far more comprehensive historical resources.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not about party. Everybody is more online. Everybody is more unfiltered. Everybody is more human sounding and authentic, and websites don’t sound like press releases anymore,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  But former officials who worked on the White House website in past administrations say that the official government website should be a trusted and reliable resource, not be a place for mischaracterizing the truth and taking cheap shots at the opposing party.\n \n\n   \n  “Citizens need to be able to rely on whitehouse.gov, and that public trust in government breaks down when there’s information that is politically motivated, especially in contexts that are meant to be historically grounded versus an administration’s individual priorities and issues,” Ashleigh Axios, a former creative director within the Office of Digital Strategy in the Obama administration, said in an interview with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to edits to the  White House’s “About” page  amid outrage over the East Wing demolition as “a misuse of whitehouse.gov and a misuse of government properties.”\n \n\n   \n  This includes a picture marking Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the “Major Events Timeline” – part of several additions, including “Cocaine Discovered,”  falsely linking  former President Joe Biden’s son Hunter to cocaine found at the White House in 2023; a “Muslim Brotherhood Visit” under the Obama administration, which misleadingly uses a pre-presidency photo of Obama in Somali dress during a visit to Kenya; and the establishment of a  “Trans Day of Visibility”  under Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We called it internally the ‘Easter eggs’ to see if anyone would find it,” the Trump White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The timeline additions, which the official said pointed out hypocrisy, are unrelated to other items detailing construction projects at the White House. Key context is left out; photos misrepresent the facts and the new highlighted events clearly target Democratic administrations. On the page, the “East Wing Expansion Stages” are explained, but its demolition isn’t.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for TMZ to write up the changes to the timeline, which White House communications director Steven Cheung reposted on X, writing, “HAHAHAHAHA!”\n \n\n   \n  The timeline stood out to Axios, the Obama administration official, who posted  on LinkedIn , “Misinformation has no place on the White House website.”\n \n\n   \n  “WhiteHouse.gov isn’t just another website,” she said. “It’s the digital front door of the presidency.”\n \n\n   \n  But to White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr, the additions to the timeline are just “unfortunate truths.” And he hinted more to come.\n \n\n   \n  “These are truths. There is no misinformation. If  WhiteHouse.gov  is the front door of a presidency then our site is a reflection of the most innovative and communicative President in history. The facts will continue. The memes will continue. Enjoy :),” Dorr  posted on X  in response to Axios.\n \n\n   \n  Macon Phillips, the former director of digital strategy at the White House in the Obama era, argued that the Trump administration’s provocative approach should be ignored. He characterized the strategy as a distraction from real issues facing Americans, like  rising health care premiums  – the key sticking point for Democrats during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Red herring is when they used to take spoiled fish and drag it across the field to get the hounds off the scent of the fox,” Phillips said. “This strategy that they have is meant to get us talking about this, instead of the fact that health insurance premiums in Vermont, where I live, are about to be gutted and people are going to die.”\n \n\n   \n    An evolving digital landscape\n \n\n   \n  While no previous administration has used the White House website quite as aggressively as the Trump administration, some digital teams have gotten in hot water for certain content posted on the site.\n \n\n   \n  Obama’s second-term digital team  once faced backlash  for adding content to former presidential biographies that tied to the administration’s initiatives at the time, while the Bush administration’s digital team couldn’t hyperlink to sites outside of .gov and .mil., even nonprofits, like the Red Cross.\n \n\n   \n  “Links to private media outlets with advertising, one could argue, could financially benefit those outlets if they write positive coverage,” Almacy, the Bush administration official, recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “Our rules were pretty strict,” he added, noting how social media changed the digital landscape. “Now, it seems like it’s off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican digital operative said in his view, the biography of Trump on the Biden White House website “reads a little political.”\n \n\n   \n  The Biden-era  White House website  factually includes Trump’s impeachments; the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot; the death count during the coronavirus pandemic; and the late 2018 government shutdown. But it also lists his achievements on signing a major tax reform law and moving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Almacy also recalled tone shifts on the Obama website,  like a 2010 blog post , where the administration wrote, “The President blasts Republicans in the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  But he questioned how Republicans would react if the Obama administration made similar politically motivated additions to the “Major Events Timeline.” After years of working on the website, he said he doesn’t visit it anymore.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s imagine that Barack Obama posted things on white house.gov that were just completely derogatory and accusatory and attacking of Republicans. How do you think the Republicans would take that?” Almacy said. “This is the precedent that’s being set.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/style/joe-jonas-how-to-wear-a-casual-tie-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:09:00-04:00","title":"Look of the Week: Joe Jonas and the rise of the casual tie","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the resurgence of the casual tie in modern fashion, tracing its evolution from a formal workplace staple to a relaxed, creative accessory worn with jeans, sweatshirts, or suits.

\n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:09 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, Joe Jonas arrived at a taping of “Good Morning America” in New York looking a little bit like a high-school English teacher from 1998. His moss green zip-up Jacquemus sweater, worn atop a collared shirt and tie, with blue jeans and a Ford Mustang baseball cap, was a clunky collision of smart casual, but executed with a knowing wink.\n \n\n   \n  Ties, it seems, are no longer formal attire. Once they might have been reserved for weddings, funerals, business meetings, or galas; today they are being worn more liberally — and not necessarily with a suit. Just look at A$AP Rocky, who has been experimenting with styling the accessory in more playful ways. In one 2024 photo, he is seen pairing a Bottega Veneta pinstriped shirt with straight leg denim, a chunky patterned tie and a padded gilet. His counterparts are doing the same. Last May, fellow rapper Pusha T wore a Louis Vuitton tie and white shirt but eschewed the conventional tailored jacket for a zip-up leather hoodie.\n \n\n   \n  After surveying the street style of the attendees at Paris Fashion Week this year, GQ declared the tie was “so back.” Except this time, they looked looser — and often without a blazer in sight.\n \n\n   \n  You can blame Dior’s menswear show in June by Jonathan Anderson, the label’s creative director. Necks were a key focal point for Anderson here. His models’ decolletage was sometimes trussed up in silk cravats, or left entirely bare as they went shirtless under a jacket. When ties did pop up on the runway, they were styled  a la  naughty school boys — scrunched and worn inside-out, with careless half-popped collars.\n \n\n   \n  Anderson has also outfitted his roster of celebrity clients, who sit front row at his shows, in a similar way. A$AP Rocky wore his festive red and green tie asymmetrically over one collar, much like the sleepily dressed runway models — while British actors Josh O’Connor and Jonathan Bailey played it straight and stuck with convention. Bailey somewhat resembled a corporate tech bro, styling his tie with a shirt and blue Dior-logoed half-zip sweater.\n \n\n   \n  Men’s fashion preferences had been shifting away from neckties for several decades, driven by more casual dress codes in the workplace and a growing preference for comfort, even before the pandemic. In 2019, Hermès, best known for its silk accessories and leather handbags, reported slow growth in its silk and textiles unit for the previous year, with CEO Axel Dumas blaming the “structural decline” of neckties.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, journalist Jonah Weiner  wrote  in his menswear newsletter “Blackbird Spyplane” that his personal disdain for neckties came from the fact that, to him, they represented a “cursed Obama-era workplace cliche” and the “repressive gaze” of corporate overlords.\n \n\n   \n  When the workforce returned to their desks a year later, the tie didn’t always come with it: A photo of world leaders at the 2022 G7 summit circulated around the internet after people noticed that not one government representative — from former US President Joe Biden to President of France Emmanuel Macron — was wearing one. Gildo Zegna, chairman and chief executive of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group, shared a similar view when he  spoke  to the Business of Fashion that same year: “For the tie, I don’t see a good future.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, soon after, the tide changed. By 2023, GQ reported that neckties had become the hottest product at Hermès, as the brand developed new stylish options — some had more contemporary narrow widths; others were made from experimental fabrics like knit and even leather.\n \n\n   \n  Today, as changing social roles and gender equality ignites  conversations on what it means to be a man today , the adoption of the casual tie could be one response. Some critics see them as the modern-day codpiece (in the 16th century, the fabric pouch evolved from a practical modesty garment into a prominent fashion statement and symbol of masculinity). The phallic-shaped necktie, pointing like an arrow, directs attention from the wearer’s throat to groin as a masculine marker — which is why the recent spike in female wearers, including A-listers Zendaya, Mikey Madison, Iris Law, Madonna, Sabrina Carpenter, Hailey Bieber, Ayo Edibiri and Brooke Shields, is so powerful.\n \n\n   \n  Now, there are almost no rules on when to wear a tie. They can be worn with jeans, while running errands, under a sweatshirt or, if you are feeling old-school, to the office. The freedom to choose a tie, rather than feel mandated to wear one, makes the decision more creative. The Jonas brothers, who attended a red carpet premiere for their latest film just hours after their TV appearance Monday, each wore a suit. Ultimately they decided to skip the tie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-economy-white-house-strategy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"White House Weighs Stepped Up Domestic Travel and Speeches to Improve Trump’s Standing on the Economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s advisers are pushing for increased domestic travel and economy-focused speeches to address public concern over rising costs and inflation, especially after recent Democratic electoral wins and a prolonged government shutdown that heightened economic anxiety.

domestic travel and speeches to improve Trump’s standing on the economy \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  advisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president has  bristled at in public : Americans’ outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration’s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren’t resonating.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t convince people that their experience, what they’re feeling at home, isn’t reality,” one of the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed by  rising prices , they said. They have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on Trump’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans’ economic anxiety are “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there’s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs.\n \n\n   \n  Two key factors last week — Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown — initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,” Trump said, responding to the criticism that  he was too busy meeting with foreign leaders . “But with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans’ perception of his administration’s handling of the economy and the media’s coverage of it.\n \n\n   \n  “The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official said. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing,” pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  acknowledged  that frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they were  getting “killed” politically  by the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It appears the shutdown could be over by week’s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed another  potential political liability  for the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week’s votes to reopen the government.)\n \n\n   \n    ‘We have the greatest economy ever’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed during Monday’s Fox News interview about why Americans say they’re down on the economy if he’s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,” Trump said. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In a  CNN poll  released last week, 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.)\n \n\n   \n  Some of the president’s defensive messaging has come from what he’s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They’ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. “The President’s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation — and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump — he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Trump’s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats’ affordability message as a “con job,” he’s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He’s floated  $2,000 tariff rebate checks  to lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he’s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with).\n \n\n   \n  All of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath.\n \n\n   \n  And while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week’s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden’s mistakes, which means taking Americans’ perceptions about the economy seriously — and doing something about it.\n \n\n   \n  With critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump’s term now less than a year away, they don’t see time to waste.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/jack-schlossberg-jfk-grandson-us-house-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:14:00-05:00","title":"Jack Schlossberg, John F.

Kennedy, is announcing a run for the US House from New York City, becoming JFK’s first direct descendent and latest member of his family to run for elected office.\n \n\n   \n  In a video announcing his campaign, Schlossberg says the “country is at a turning point.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a crisis at every level, a cost-of-living crisis sponsored by the big, beautiful bill, historic cuts to social programs working families rely on health care, education, childcare, a corruption crisis,” Schlossberg said, focusing on affordability while criticizing President Donald Trump. “He’s picking winners and losers from inside the Oval Office, it’s cronyism, not capitalism and a constitutional crisis with one dangerous man in control of all three branches of government, he’s stripping citizens of their civil rights and silencing his critics.”\n \n\n   \n  Schlossberg is running to replace the retiring  Rep. Jerry Nadler , who represents New York’s 12th Congressional District.\n \n\n   \n  Without directly mentioning his famous lineage,   Schlossberg   describes himself as having been “born and raised” in the district, which stretches from Union Square up through Midtown and then to the Upper West and Upper East sides.\n \n\n   \n  “I took the bus to school every single day from one side of the district to the other,” Schlossberg said.

Schlossberg emerged as an outspoken voice calling for Democratic Party reforms after its losses in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Hey guys ? have formed an exploratory committee,” he wrote on social media in September, days after Nadler announced he would not seek reelection.\n \n\n   \n  Schlossberg, 32, the youngest child of Caroline Kennedy and her husband Edwin Schlossberg, told CNN that he would pay homage to his grandfather “organically,” noting that the 35th president “broke the mold.”\n \n\n   \n  Online and in media appearances, Schlossberg has aligned himself with the young, progressive wing of the Democratic Party pressing for generational change. He backed Mayor-elect  Zohran Mamdani  in the New York City mayor’s race, remarking, “I don’t give a f**k” about crossing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was previously married to Kerry Kennedy, John F. Kennedy’s niece.\n \n\n   \n  Three generations of Kennedys have served in elected office, including John F. Kennedy’s brothers Robert, a former attorney general and New York senator, and  Ted , the longtime senator from Massachusetts.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  is currently Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary, though much of the stalwart Democratic family has  disavowed  RFK Jr.’s views on politics and medicine.

Carolyn Maloney, state assemblymembers Alex Bores and Tony Simone, New York City Council member Erik Bottcher, and Cameron Kasky, an activist and survivor of the Parkland High School shooting.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong performance in this year’s elections, Democrats are hopeful the 2026 midterm battle for control of the House and Senate will reinvigorate the party and help it push back against the president’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/syrias-postwar-pivot-reaches-washington-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"03:36:00.000Z","title":"Syria’s jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmed Al-Sharaa, a former jihadist fighter who rose to power in Syria in January 2025, made history by becoming the first Syrian president to visit the U.S. White House in November 2025.

in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/cop30-protesters-belem-brazil-climate-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:13:00-05:00","title":"Protesters force their way into COP30 summit venue, clash with security","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, dozens of Indigenous protesters breached security barriers at the UN compound, demanding land rights, an end to agribusiness, oil exploration, and illegal mining.

We have to do this as quickly as possible,” the Republican leader said Monday.\n \n\n   \n    When will the House vote?\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to begin voting on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer.\n \n\n   \n  The vote will take place as early as 4 p.m., per the notice, which forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The House Rules Committee voted on party lines early Wednesday morning to advance the Senate-passed package to reopen the government, a key hurdle the bill needed to clear before a floor vote.\n \n\n   \n  The panel did not adopt any amendments offered in committee during the seven-hour meeting, including amendments extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Next, the full House will have to take a procedural vote on the rule, expected to happen on Wednesday, before moving to vote on final passage of the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The House hasn’t voted or been in legislative session since September 19.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the lawmakers to watch?\n \n\n   \n  Johnson will have to work closely with the White House to muscle this deal through the House, given it is unclear how many Democrats will cross over to support the package and Republicans hold such a narrow majority.\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen moderate House Republicans had wanted to see the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies extended and had their  own bill   to address the issue at the center of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, House Democratic leadership is actively working to prevent rank-and-file members from voting for this bill because they say it falls short of what Democrats fought for during the shutdown. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who is not seeking reelection and has been known to vote with Republicans, is among those to watch.\n \n\n   \n    What are House Democratic leaders saying?\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his team hope to limit the number of Democrats who support the plan, which will maximize pressure on House Republicans to land the votes themselves. And House Democratic leaders are officially whipping against the Senate funding compromise, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The House Democratic leader reiterated to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that Democrats will “strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican health care crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to reopen the government. We’ll continue to stand by our hardworking federal employees and civil servants. But we have a responsibility to make sure that we extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so that tens of millions of Americans don’t experience dramatically increased health care costs that’s going to prevent them from being able to see a doctor when they need one,” Jeffries said on “The Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n    Does the government open as soon as the House passes the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Not quite yet.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What does Trump think of the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has already endorsed the Senate plan to reopen the government, calling the funding deal a “positive development” toward ending the record-long shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” a White House official said in a statement. “The action in the Senate is a positive development and we look forward to seeing it progress.”\n \n\n   \n  And adding to expectation that Trump will sign the measure, the president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I would say so,” when asked whether he personally approved of the deal making its way through Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said Monday. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the funding package?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap measure through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/paris-jackson-perforated-septum-drug-use","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Paris Jackson Reveals She Has a Perforated Septum: ‘Don’t Do Drugs Kids’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paris Jackson, the only daughter of Michael Jackson, revealed in a TikTok-reposted video that she has a perforated septum—a condition she attributes to past drug use—emphasizing that 'don’t do drugs, kids' as a warning to youth.

Cristosal alleges that dozens of Venezuelans deported from the United States to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year were subjected to torture and other serious abuses including sexual violence.\n \n\n   \n  The report released Wednesday includes interviews with 40 of the 252 Venezuelans who were sent to the notorious  Terrorism Confinement Center  (Cecot). They describe being beaten by guards, with some being taken to solitary confinement as punishment for protesting, and others being driven to the brink of suicide.\n \n\n   \n  The report accuses El Salvador’s prison system of systematic human rights violations and the Trump administration of complicity in torture, enforced disappearances and other violations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a CNN inquiry, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defended the administration’s decision to send the migrants to Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  “At President (Donald) Trump’s direction, DHS deported nearly 300 Tren de Aragua and MS-13 terrorists to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) Prison in El Salvador, where they no longer pose a threat to the American people,” said a statement attributed to   Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reached out to the Salvadoran presidency and the Salvadoran prisons directorate for comment. In the past, El Salvador’s government has said that it respects the human rights of people in its custody, “regardless of their nationality,” and that its prison system complies with safety and order standards.\n \n\n   \n     They ‘arrived in hell’ \n \n\n   \n  “The nightmare began the moment they took me off the plane,” the report quotes Gonzalo, a 26-year-old from Zulia, Venezuela, as saying. Gonzalo claims the migrants were beaten upon landing in El Salvador and that the mistreatment continued when they were transferred to Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  He said a prison official told them, “You have arrived in hell.”\n \n\n   \n  He and others interviewed by HRW and Cristosal alleged that guards periodically assaulted them with kicks, punches and batons during daily cell searches.\n \n\n   \n  Three of the people interviewed said they were subjected to sexual violence, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the inmates reported being humiliated by the guards, who allegedly told them they “would never get out alive,” that “nobody knew they were there,” and that “their families had abandoned them.”\n \n\n   \n  Several inmates reported having suicidal thoughts, and at least one said he attempted suicide.\n \n\n   \n  “I fell into depression. I wanted to kill myself because I thought I would be better off dead. In the end, the only thing that gave me strength was God … and my family, my wife, my daughter, and my mother,” another detainee, Nelson, says in the report.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the findings in the report match what several former detainees told CNN in late July, days after being released from Cecot and repatriated to Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Welcome to the hell of Cecot,” Venezuelan makeup artist  Andry Hernández  recalled in a CNN interview about his arrival at the Salvadoran prison.\n \n\n   \n   Jerce Reyes ,  José Mora and Rafael Martínez  all told CNN   they were frequently beaten by guards – often for disobeying the prison’s strict rules or for reasons they considered unwarranted. They also accused Salvadoran prison authorities of denying them of basic human rights, including access to attorneys and adequate living conditions.\n \n\n   \n  On a hot day, Reyes said he showered to keep cool at a time he wasn’t allowed to. The guards caught him, entered the cell, beat him up and sent him to a smaller isolated cell as punishment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Martínez alleged that he was once punished for putting his head through the cell bars when he felt sick. He said he was taken to a different cell, where about eight guards beat him and fractured his right arm.\n \n\n   \n  “(The guards) tortured us physically and psychologically,” Mora said.\n \n\n   \n  The men also spoke about going on strike to demand basic rights, including communication with the outside world. But their protests were met with a fierce response from guards, they said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we protested, they shot at us point-blank with rubber bullets, point-blank into the cell,” Mora told CNN. “We were like chickens or rats locked up … and they shot us with rubber bullets.”\n \n\n   \n     Claims of criminal involvement  \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration accused the deportees, without proof, of being linked to the Tren de Aragua criminal organization.\n \n\n   \n  Human Rights Watch and Cristosal claimed in their report that approximately half of the Venezuelans sent to Cecot had no criminal records and only 3% had been convicted in the United States for a violent or potentially violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  In its response to CNN, DHS insisted the nearly 300 detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs, saying the groups are “some of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth” and asserted that they “rape, maim, and murder for sport.”\n \n\n   \n  Reyes, Mora and Martínez said they were wrongly accused by US officials of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang and, despite their denials, were deported from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  According to records, Martínez faced robbery charges in the US, pleaded guilty, and was released on bail before being arrested and sent to a Salvadoran prison.\n \n\n   \n  Mora, meanwhile, was imprisoned in Venezuela for drug-related offenses and served his sentence. In the United States, he received traffic violations, according to official records.\n \n\n   \n  CNN verified that Reyes has no criminal record in his home country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/uk-suspends-caribbean-intelligence-sharing-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00-05:00","title":"Exclusive: UK suspends some intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Kingdom has suspended intelligence sharing with the United States regarding suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean, citing concerns that US military strikes — which have killed 76 people — violate international law and amount to extrajudicial killing.

That meant the ships would be stopped, boarded, its crew detained, and drugs seized.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence was typically sent to Joint Interagency Task Force South, a task force stationed in Florida that includes representatives from a number of partner nations and works to reduce the illicit drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  But shortly after the US began launching lethal strikes against the boats in September, however, the UK grew concerned that the US might use intelligence provided by the British to select targets. British officials believe the US military strikes, which have killed 76 people, violate international law, the sources said. The intelligence pause began over a month ago, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last month that the strikes violate international law and amount to “extrajudicial killing.” The UK agrees with that assessment, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The British embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official told CNN that the department “doesn’t talk about intelligence matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, Cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights — something the UK was happy to help with, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has argued that the US military can legally kill suspected traffickers because they pose an imminent threat to Americans and are “enemy combatants” who are in an “armed conflict” with the US, according to a memo sent by the administration to Congress. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel  issued an opinion , which is still classified, reinforcing that argument, CNN has reported, and Trump has designated a number of drug cartels as “foreign terrorist groups.” The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say the Law of Armed Conflict  would still apply to civilian drug traffickers , and the designation of a group as a foreign terrorist organization does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force. Several boats hit by the US have either been stationary or were turning around when they were attacked, CNN has reported, undermining the administration’s claim that they posed an imminent threat that could not be dealt with through interdiction and arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US defense officials have also expressed skepticism of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey,  offered to resign  during a tense meeting last month with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey will leave his post in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful. Hegseth’s spokesperson has previously denied that any lawyers involved in the operations have dissented.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, another key US ally which has helped the US Coast Guard interdict suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean for nearly two decades, has also distanced itself from the US military strikes. The sources told CNN that Canada intends to continue its partnership with the Coast Guard, called Operation Caribbean. But the country has made clear to the US that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Canada’s defense  told Canadian press  last month that “it is important to note that Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbean, conducted in co-ordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct” from the US military strikes on suspected drug vessels.\n \n\n   \n  Colombian President  Gustavo Petro  said Tuesday that he had similarly ordered his country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the attacks in the Caribbean stop, saying in a post on X, “The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/adelita-grijalva-arizona-mike-johnson-swearing-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:32:00.000-05:00","title":"Rep.-elect Grijalva says she plans to confront Johnson at long-delayed swearing-in ceremony","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Adelita Grijalva, a Democratic representative-elect from Arizona’s 7th congressional district, will confront House Speaker Mike Johnson at her long-delayed swearing-in ceremony after nearly 50 days of inaction, claiming that the delay is undemocratic, unconstitutional, and an attempt to obstruct a vote on releasing records related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Cambodia hailed by Trump after landmine explosion injures troops \n       \n  By Helen Regan, Kocha Olarn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:59 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thailand has said it was halting progress on a peace agreement with Cambodia, signed last month in Malaysia and  overseen by US President Donald Trump,  after a landmine explosion at the border injured several Thai soldiers on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia fought a  five-day border conflict  in July that killed dozens of people and displaced about 200,000 on both sides of the border.\n \n\n   \n  An initial ceasefire between the two Southeast Asian countries was agreed on July 28 after the US president held calls with the respective leaders. Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Malaysia in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  hailed the declaration  as further proof of his ability to end wars but within less than a fortnight the agreement has begun fraying.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the supreme commander of Thailand’s armed forces, Gen. Ukris Boontanondha, said he was “halting all agreements until Cambodia clearly and sincerely demonstrates that it will not be ‘hostile’,” according to a Facebook post from Thailand’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sihasak Phuangketkeow said they would clarify their decision to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent major U-turn came after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand, on the volatile border with Cambodia Monday.\n \n\n   \n  One soldier’s right leg was severed in the blast, while another suffered shrapnel wounds to the leg, the army said. The incident happened while troops were on a “routine patrol along a frequently used route,” said Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army.\n \n\n   \n  After visiting the wounded soldiers near the contested border on Tuesday Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said, “Today, we consider that the agreement we had in place to move toward peace has ended.”\n \n\n   \n  “Thailand belongs to us. The ground we are standing on right now is Thailand. No one can claim sovereignty over Thai territory,” Anutin added.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand accused Cambodia of violating the joint declaration by laying fresh landmines following the removal of a barbed wire fence, which was discovered on November 9.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot independently verify the claims that Cambodian troops laid fresh landmines.\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government said in a statement it “categorically denies the allegations,” adding that it has not deployed new landmines “and will never do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia also said it is “gravely concerned” about reports that Thailand has suspended the peace declaration and it remains committed to implementing the peace accord.\n \n\n   \n  “Most minefields, from nearly three decades of Cambodia’s civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s, along the Cambodia-Thailand border have not yet been cleared due to the difficult terrains and the un-demarcated status of the border areas,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation remains calm,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson said Tuesday after military forces from both sides communicated following the landmine explosion.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Thailand also calls into question the already tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, who were scheduled to be handed over under the terms of the declaration. Thailand’s Defense Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit said the expected release would not go ahead.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile peace agreement\n \n\n   \n  In late October, Trump traveled to Malaysia as part of his three-leg tour of Asia and presided over the signing of a  peace declaration  between the leaders of Thailand Cambodia amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts in the border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was considered by Trump as a major diplomatic victory, and another fillip to his much vaunted –  and often over-exaggerated  – campaign to have ended several wars.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought brief skirmishes in recent decades over their disputed border and the fighting earlier was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had warned the two leaders that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration included a commitment to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, de-mining efforts, and to de-escalate tensions that erupted into the brief but deadly border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement was built on the truce signed in July, but fell short of a “peace treaty,” despite Trump  repeatedly describing  it as such. And  analysts had cautioned  of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.\n \n\n   \n  Anutin had qualified the signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration. And Thai diplomats were carefully reticent about the joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire  both sides agreed  to in July.\n \n\n   \n  Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia announced at the time “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of landmines along the Thai-Cambodia border has also been a major point of contention for the Thais. The most recent border flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has previously sought a ruling from the UN’s International Court of Justice over disputed areas. However, Thailand does not recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated, including the sites of several ancient temples.\n \n\n   \n  The site of the most recent landmine explosion was in an area close to Cambodia’s Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has been at the center of previous military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration did not resolve the territorial dispute over the two countries’ shared border.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/travel/sea-life-london-penguins-campaign-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:44:00-05:00","title":"Pressure grows for release of penguins 'trapped' at London aquarium","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing political and public campaign is demanding the release of 15 Gentoo penguins housed in a basement at the Sea Life London Aquarium, where they lack access to daylight, fresh air, and sufficient space for natural behaviors.

I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,” Kimmel recalled.\n \n\n   \n  News of Escobedo’s death comes after Thursday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show’s guests. The date and cause of Escobedo’s death weren’t immediately known.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.\n \n\n   \n  “Jimmy asked me, ‘Who are we going to get in the band?’ I said, ‘Well, my normal guys,’ and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I’d invite him to gigs, and if he didn’t have anything to do he’d come check it out, so he knew my guys,” Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. “Then he just said, ‘Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn’t that be kind of cool?’ I was like, ‘That would be way cool.’”\n \n\n   \n  In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.\n \n\n   \n  “Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it’s more of a young man’s game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I’ve learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they’re babies; you come back and then they’re talking, it’s like, ‘What?’” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers,” Kimmel wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/supreme-court-extends-hold-on-full-snap-payments","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Keeps Full SNAP Payments on Hold with Short-Term Order","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court extended a short-term administrative stay that blocks the Trump administration from providing full SNAP benefits for November, maintaining a legal limbo that affects over 42 million Americans.

November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended a short-term order that allows the Trump administration to withhold paying for full food stamp payments in November, a move that appeared designed to put off the case a few days in the hope that Congress approves a pending  agreement to reopen the federal government .\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving emergency appeal at the Supreme Court over Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that help more than 40 million Americans – as well as several lawsuits playing out in lower courts – would almost certainly be dismissed as moot if the historic shutdown ends in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  But until that happens, the “administrative stay” that  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued Friday  will continue to block a lower court order that required the administration to provide full federal food benefits.\n \n\n   \n  In a new brief order on Tuesday, the court said it was extending the administrative stay through the end of the day Thursday. Jackson dissented from the extension.\n \n\n   \n  Along with canceled flights, the spiraling legal battle over food stamps became a defining and tangible impact of the shutdown. The groups challenging the administration told the Supreme Court in a brief earlier Tuesday that SNAP beneficiaries had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food” and that millions of Americans, including children, were going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps on a staggered basis throughout each month. Nearly 27 million should have gotten their allotments by Monday, according to estimates by Code for America, which works with governments to improve access to safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive around $350, on average, each month to help them buy food, though for many families, the assistance is spent quickly.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration countered that a lower court that ordered full SNAP payments was out of line, requiring the US Department of Agriculture to transfer about $4 billion out of one fund and into another. And, the Justice Department warned, the lower court orders on food aid “inject the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Under a separate court order that was not before the Supreme Court, the administration relied on contingency funds to pay partial food stamp benefits for November. The question before the Supreme Court, then, was whether the administration could be required to pay the full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the multiple and varied USDA guidance memos to states stemming from the court actions, a number of states sent either full or partial November benefits to their residents. At least 16 states have provided beneficiaries with their full allotments for the month, and another five states have sent partial payments, according to a CNN tally.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in government funding.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The nonprofit groups challenging President Donald Trump raced back to US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island last week to argue that the court should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. The administration quickly appealed to the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, who handles emergency appeals from the 1st Circuit, issued what’s known as an “administrative stay” on Friday, effectively putting McConnell’s order on hold for a few days so lower courts could review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s emergency order was set to expire a few minutes before midnight on Tuesday. The justice did not explain her decision to dissent from the court’s extension.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/marion-county-record-raid-search","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:34:00-05:00","title":"A Kansas County Agrees to Pay $3 Million and Apologize for Raid on Small-Town Newspaper","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In August 2023, Marion County, Kansas, conducted a raid on the Marion County Record newspaper, seizing equipment and entering the home of its publisher and a councilwoman, under claims that a reporter had unlawfully obtained a restaurant owner’s driving records.

Rhodes said he expects that suit to go to trial.\n \n\n   \n  “The most important consequence was that, you know, if you act like a bully, you try to weaponize the criminal justice system against the press, there’s going to be a price to pay, and that price is now measured in millions,” Meyer said. “This is just the first shoe of two shoes to fall. This is the county portion of it. The city was the main instigator of this raid.”\n \n\n   \n  Meyer noted that press freedoms are still under attack across the country and more needs to be done to stop incidents like this from happening elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  “This is kind of a part of the system these days where the Justice Department is weaponized against political enemies, where laws are stretched to their breaking point, where … if you want to enforce some law, you can go out and do whatever you want unless somebody challenges it in court. Well, guess what? Somebody did challenge it in court, and we won,” Meyer said.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement means Joan Meyer’s death was not in vain, Rhodes said.\n \n\n   \n  “Her death prompted this rallying cry by press organizations across the world, not just the United States, but across the world, that it’s time to stand up to these bullying techniques,” the attorney said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/camp-mystic-texas-flooding-lawsuits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Families of 15 Camp Mystic Flood Victims File Lawsuits Claiming Gross Negligence After 27 Girls and Counselors Died","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Families of 15 victims from the Camp Mystic flood disaster filed lawsuits against the camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence, including failing to evacuate campers despite known flood risks and misleading safety instructions.

Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  One lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  A second lawsuit was filed by the family of 8-year-old Eloise “Lulu” Peck.\n \n\n   \n  A third was filed by the family of  9-year-old Ellen Getten .\n \n\n   \n  And a fourth was filed by the families of six other campers: Virginia Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane Hunt, Lucy Dillon and Kellyanne Lytal.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants in each lawsuit include Camp Mystic and members of the Eastland family, which owns the 99-year-old camp in Kerr County.\n \n\n   \n   “ Tragically, due to lack of planning, the absence of any evacuation plans, lack of training, inadequate warning systems, and other acts and omissions of recklessness and gross negligence, Plaintiffs’ daughters suffered terrifying, brutal, and horrific deaths,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.\n \n\n   \n  While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the lawsuits allege\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors claims Camp Mystic didn’t have adequate safety plans and prioritized money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.”\n \n\n   \n  On the morning of July 4, “the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp “chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp,” it continued. “Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  Another lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at  Bubble Inn cabin .\n \n\n   \n  The camp’s directors should have known about emergency alerts in the area before the calamitous flooding and should have been on “high alert,” the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  But there was no plan to evacuate campers until 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” the third lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of six girls slammed “Camp Mystic’s so-called ‘Emergency Instructions.’” A wrinkled copy of those instructions was found in a counselor’s flooded trunk.\n \n\n   \n  Under the “Floods” section, the instructions say “Campers and counselors NEVER wander away from your cabin” and “All cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”\n \n\n   \n  “Tragically, the last two sentences of Camp Mystic’s instructions caused the loss of Plaintiffs’ children’s lives,” that lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence. Further, to state that ‘[a]ll cabins are constructed on high, safe ground’ was patently false, misleading [and] created a false sense of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  Photos from inside one cabin show “the water rose so close to the ceiling (5 ¾ inches) [that] the girls ran out of air space and were tragically swept into the raging flood waters,” the lawsuit states. Eight-year-old Lucy “did not make it out of the cabin where she lost her life.”\n \n\n   \n  All four lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court and compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n  The first three lawsuits each seek more than $1 million in damages. The fourth suit does not specify an amount.\n \n\n   \n    The camp responds\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n  The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said, noting camp leaders helped evacuate 166 girls.\n \n\n   \n  But a photo in the lawsuit filed by the six families – which attorneys say was timestamped at 3:26 a.m. – showed some campers wading in floodwater to get to higher ground.\n \n\n   \n  Watts challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  next summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  The news stunned Steward, who still doesn’t know where her daughter is.\n \n\n   \n  “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter’s body,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/nba-mavericks-nico-harrison-fans","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Mavs fans wanted Nico Harrison fired.

Every Mavs fan knew the moment the trade happened that Nico would eventually be fired,” he said. “This still does not change that (owner Patrick) Dumont knows nothing about basketball. … Unless they bring Dirk (Nowitski, a franchise legend) back into the fold with an official position, preferably general manager, I will have no faith in Dumont or who he hires to make good decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Slovak’s frustration runs deeper than Harrison’s front-office record. He blamed ownership – the Dumonts and the Adelsons — for what he sees as a series of tone-deaf decisions that alienated fans.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s close to impossible to root for an organization that they own,” he said, adding that the only thing keeping him invested is  the potential of phenom Cooper Flagg. \n \n\n   \n     Hope and heartbreak \n \n\n   \n  For Skylar Alcala, who adored Dončić when he played on the Mavs, the firing brought an emotional mix of relief and lingering pain.\n \n\n   \n  “First initial reaction, THANK THE LORD!” she said. “With how the Mavs have started this season, I’m glad Dumont realized that what Nico did to this team was detrimental.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Alcala said the damage runs deep.\n \n\n   \n  “The way I feel about the Mavs now is still heartbreak. … There’s definitely a slight weight lifted off my shoulders knowing Nico is gone, but the Mavs organization has a-ways to go to build back trust,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  And the Dončić trade still stings: “The hardest part in all of this is seeing Luka dominate for the Lakers while we watch and wish every day for him to be back in a Mavs uniform.”\n \n\n   \n     A chance to heal – and rebuild \n \n\n   \n  John Tarrant – who, despite the Dončić trade, continued to cheer for the team and brings his sons to games – called the move long overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about time. The only person upset is Jerry Jones because he’s no longer the second-worst respected GM in DFW,” he quipped. “This organization and fan base needs to heal, and this is a first step.”\n \n\n   \n  Tarrant said fans are ready to move forward and build around young star Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  “Next steps need to happen. Anyone associated with Harrison’s tenure – including Anthony Davis – needs to be moved. Let’s rebuild this from the ground up around Flagg,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, he couldn’t hide his frustration at the trade that defined Harrison’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  “To trade a 25-year-old superstar for an injury-prone, aging veteran who has only played 14 of 46 games still makes zero sense,” Tarrant said. “Can Cuban buy back the team?”\n \n\n   \n     The bottom line \n \n\n   \n  The firing of Harrison may close one painful chapter, but the Mavericks’ front office faces immense pressure to get the next one right. Fans have made it clear: firing Harrison was a start – not a solution.\n \n\n   \n  As Slovak put it, “It’s not impossible to salvage the situation, but there’s been no indication over the last year that leadership is capable of making the decisions required to bring back the fans.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/fda-cder-pazdur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:24:00Z","title":"Longtime FDA Oncology Leader Named Agency’s Top Drug Regulator","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Richard Pazdur, a longtime leader in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s oncology division, has been named the new head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research—the agency’s largest division responsible for regulating prescription drugs and over-the-counter products such as sunscreens and antiperspirants.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:59 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump called into Pat McAfee’s show on ESPN on Tuesday, discussing his admiration for the nation’s veterans on Veterans Day, the impending end of the government shutdown, the role of sports in his political life and the big money in college sports.\n \n\n   \n  But there was one topic that really got the president fired up:  The NFL’s new kickoff format. \n \n\n   \n  “I  hate  the kickoff,” Trump said to protestations from McAfee.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so demeaning, and I think it hurts the game. It hurts the pageantry. I’ve told that to Roger Goodell, and I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other, and … it’s the opposite of what the game (is supposed to be). The ball is in the air, and nobody’s moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to move.\n \n\n   \n  “You walk in and the pageantry of the game is so badly hurt. And I don’t think NFL, you know, they don’t, they do what they want to do, but I don’t think they’ll change.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been a frequent critic of the NFL’s revamped kickoff format, adopted for the first time last season in an effort to decrease the intense collisions that frequently resulted in injuries.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the league for comment on Trump’s latest criticism on the so-called dynamic kickoff.\n \n\n   \n  Under the old rules, the kicking team started at its 35-yard line and tried to kick the ball as far downfield as possible to give their defense a better chance of stopping the offense far from the end zone. Meanwhile, the receiving team tries to move the ball as far as they can up the field. With two teams running at each other at top speed, collisions between players were often devastating.\n \n\n   \n  The new version still sees the ball kicked from the kicking team’s 35-yard line, but every player on the kicking team other than the kicker himself now lines up with at least one foot on the returning team’s 40-yard line.\n \n\n   \n  Players must also wait to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20-yard line. Any kick that is caught or lands in the landing zone must be returned, while any kick that falls short of the landing zone will be ruled a touchback and spotted at the returning team’s 40-yard line. If a kick hits the landing zone and then goes into the end zone, it has to be returned or downed by the receiving team.\n \n\n   \n  Among other things, it basically means players are closer together and are not colliding into each other with as much speed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has complained about the rule almost since it first debuted. But on Tuesday, he went even further with his lamentations.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope college football doesn’t change, because the power of the kickoff is, we’re so beautiful, and now it, you know, I don’t want to say what it reminds me of, because I’ll get myself into big trouble,” Trump said. “It is not football, and I have no idea what you guys – you guys may disagree with me. I don’t think it’s going to help.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so bad. It’s so bad. It’s so unromantic, and it just is demeaning to football. I don’t think they have a right to do that to the game,” Trump went on to say. “You know, the game is so important. I don’t think the people that approve that. I don’t think anybody has the right to do that to the game. And I hope college doesn’t change, and I hope that someday the NFL will stop it and go back to football.”\n \n\n   \n  The league has maintained that the new system is safer than the old and also results in more exciting plays.\n \n\n   \n  Kickoffs have long been one of the most dangerous plays in the game and were four times more likely to cause a concussion than a play that involved running or passing, according to  data  from the NFL. Since the change in format, the league has been buoyed by the early results.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the NFL  published data  from the 2024 season that showed a “significant decrease in concussions.” As intended, the new rule slowed average player speeds, which led to a lower concussion rate – down 43% from 2021-2023.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL said returns increased 57% in the 2024 regular season and that there were seven kickoffs returned for touchdowns – the most since 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, told CNN that the new rule makes the game safer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been an overwhelming success,” Sills said.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Last year, if you look at our data, significantly higher return rate but the injury rate was one of the lowest that we’ve seen. So, that was what we were looking for with the play, is to make it more exciting yet also safer. So, we looked at space and speed. It went down, which is what we expected from the play. We, again, saw more excitement. And here’s an unexpected benefit: Because the average starting point for drives was further out, closer to the 30-yard line, we had fewer punts, which is also good from a health and safety standpoint because pun is one of our more injurious plays.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/house-democrats-shutdown-trump-districts","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00-05:00","title":"What House Democrats in districts Trump won are saying about the shutdown deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Democrats in districts won by President Donald Trump in 2024 are uniting in opposition to a bipartisan shutdown deal reached by Senate Democrats, arguing that it fails to guarantee a vote in the House on extending Affordable Care Act premium tax credits — a core Democratic policy.

11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Democrats’  intraparty feud  is making its way to the House, where members of the caucus are hoping to soundly reject the deal  moderate Senate Democrats  reached with Republicans to reopen the government during a vote later this week.\n \n\n   \n  Navigating the party’s shutdown strategy will be particularly delicate for the 13 Democrats in seats that went for President Donald Trump last year. At a time when the party base has lambasted Senate Democrats, who have been accused of “caving” to end the  weekslong shutdown , most of those to speak out have rejected the Senate deal.\n \n\n   \n  The  deal to end the shutdown  would fund the government through the end of January and offer a reprieve from layoffs for federal workers. Under the agreement, the Senate plans to vote on legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, Democrats’ main funding priority. The deal does not, however, guarantee a vote will happen in the House, which has become the main sticking point for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “If we knew we were going to get a vote in the House, I’d probably support this deal,” New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose district went for Trump by 5 points last year, said during a  radio interview  with Brian Lehrer on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leadership is encouraging members to vote against the Senate deal,  CNN has reported , and one centrist coalition within the party also opposes the agreement. The moderate New Democrat Coalition on Tuesday came out against the deal, a position that required approval from two-thirds of the group’s 116 members. Ten of the 13 Democrats in Trump districts are members of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what the 13 crossover district Democrats — based on lines drawn before  this year’s redistricting battles  — have said about the deal to end the government shutdown:\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Josh Harder of California\n \n\n   \n  Harder said he is a “hell no” on the deal in  an X video  his office posted Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t a deal at all,” he said. “It’s a surrender that is doing absolutely nothing to lower health care costs and premiums for millions of Californians.”\n \n\n   \n  Harder blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats who voted for the deal, calling it an “unacceptable” capitulation to the Trump administration, and said he would push to stop it in the House. Schumer publicly opposed the deal and voted against it.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York\n \n\n   \n  Suozzi told WNYC on Monday he wasn’t ready to endorse the Senate deal because it doesn’t guarantee a vote in the House to address the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. Like many Democrats opposed to the funding bill, Suozzi said he was worried the Senate might pass a measure to address the expiring tax credits, only for the House not to take it up.\n \n\n   \n  “That would be a real kick in the head,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Nellie Pou of New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Pou called the agreement a “bad deal” in  a statement on X  and said she would oppose any measure that doesn’t extend the premium tax credits.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be voting no to any so-called government funding package that will not stop Republican price hikes on health care premiums,” Pou said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan\n \n\n   \n  McDonald Rivet said she’s opposed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently need a bipartisan budget with real solutions to fix these costs and open the government,” she  said in a statement on X . “I remain ready to work on it, but caving without health care solutions would fail countless working families who are struggling to get by.”\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio\n \n\n   \n  The Ohio lawmaker  told Spectrum News  that she will not vote for the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s at stake are the health insurance bills and the cost of health insurance for millions and millions of Americans and their families, and we cannot take their benefits away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    The other lawmakers\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina  wrote on X  that he is reviewing the deal and is focused on “ending the government shutdown responsibly and addressing the high cost of living families are facing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat, expressed concerns about the funding bill  to a local ABC affiliate , saying the deal “doesn’t get anywhere close” to resolving premium increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t help to fix the health care crisis that we are facing, not just in New Mexico but across the country,” Vasquez said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to spokespeople for Reps.

baby formula in the US amid infant botulism outbreak investigation \n       \n  By Jacqueline Howard, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:32 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The baby formula company  ByHeart said Tuesday  that it has recalled all of its infant formula products nationwide, including cans and single-serve sticks.\n \n\n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating a  multistate outbreak of infant botulism  that may be tied to ByHeart’s “whole nutrition” infant formula products.\n \n\n   \n  Epidemiologic and laboratory data has shown that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, the germ that causes botulism, the FDA said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  According to the FDA, as of Monday, 15 children with suspected or confirmed infant botulism who had also been exposed to ByHeart infant formula have been  reported in 12 states : Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  All 15 infants, who ranged in age from 16 days to 157 days, were hospitalized and given  BabyBIG , an intravenous antibody treatment for infant botulism. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism happens when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum   spores, which can grow in the gut and produce botulinum neurotoxin,  according to the CDC . Signs and symptoms – which can take several weeks to develop – may include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing and a weak and altered cry, which can progress to difficulty breathing and respiratory arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Since August, 84 infants have received treatment for infant botulism nationwide, based on data from the California Department of Public Health’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, according to the FDA. Among those infants, 43% had been exposed to powdered infant formula. And among those who had powdered infant formula exposure, more than 40% consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula.\n \n\n   \n  “This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,” according to the  FDA . “Investigations remain ongoing but have not identified any other infant formula brands or shared exposures that pose a risk to infants.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘All ByHeart product must be discarded’\n \n\n   \n  Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the co-founders of ByHeart,  said in an online letter  Tuesday that they have provided the FDA with access to all of their facilities and products.\n \n\n   \n  “Upon learning about this outbreak on Friday evening, we immediately began conducting our own extensive testing on all ByHeart batches. Additionally, we are providing the FDA complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation, which has been done regularly at our owned facilities. We will share the results of our own testing as they become available,” Funt and Belldegrun wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “At this moment, the most important thing for you to know is that all ByHeart product must be discarded. We know that switching formulas is not an easy process or decision. We have resources to help,” they said, providing a link to a guide on  how to switch infant formulas . “We are so sorry, and are committed to doing anything we can to support you.”\n \n\n   \n  Several states are testing leftover formula, the FDA said, and the results are expected in the coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n   Preliminary lab results  that the California Department of Public Health released Saturday suggested that the bacterium that causes botulism was present in an open can of ByHeart infant formula, which was fed to an infant with botulism.\n \n\n   \n  “Infant botulism is a very rare disease that occurs when babies inhale or swallow spores of the toxin-producing bacteria that cause infant botulism, which leads to progressive muscle weakness including trouble breathing if not treated in time,” Dr. Erica Pan, California Department of Public Health’s director and state public health officer,  said in a news release  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have tested a sample of the specific powdered infant formula linked with these cases and preliminary tests are positive,” Pan said. “We are urging parents to stop using ByHeart formula immediately.”​\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive for Clostridium botulinum spores or toxin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-military-mobilization-us-buildup-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:47:00Z","title":"Venezuela announces ‘massive mobilization’ of military forces as America’s largest warship sails into region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela has launched a 'massive mobilization' of its military, including land, air, naval, and reserve forces, in response to the arrival of the United States’ largest warship, the USS Gerald R.

On  Tuesday , the US Navy announced the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.

Churchill, and more than 4,000 sailors.\n \n\n   \n  The US has framed its build-up of forces in the region as aimed at combating drug trafficking and the flow of drugs into the United States, and has  carried out strikes  on numerous alleged drug boats in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  However, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change and some Trump administration officials have  privately conceded  their strategy is aimed at removing Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Trump said he had  authorized the CIA  to operate in Venezuela and he has previously suggested he was weighing the possibility of strikes inside the country – though administration officials have since said the US is not currently planning such action.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement Tuesday, Padrino López framed the deployment of the Venezuelan forces as part of Maduro’s wider “Independence Plan 200” – a civic-military strategy aimed at mobilizing conventional military forces alongside militia and police forces to defend the country.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, has some 123,000 members. Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   \n  With the arrival of the Ford, there are thought to be roughly 15,000 US personnel in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets were already in the region before the arrival of the Ford group, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former world  chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment over his comments about a rival,  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00Z","title":"Dow soars more than 550 points as Wall Street embraces optimism that government might reopen soon","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 550 points to a record high of 47,927.96 on Tuesday, driven by optimism that the U.S. government shutdown would end by the end of the week.

compound by a company linked to US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n \n\n   \n  Youth-led protesters drew a red line as they encircled the sprawling buildings in the capital, Belgrade that were partially destroyed in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign. The site faces demolition and redevelopment under a plan backed by the populist government of  President Aleksandar Vucic .\n \n\n   \n  The $500-million project to build a high-rise hotel, offices and shops at the site has met fierce opposition from experts at home and abroad, as well as the Serbian public. But last week Serbian lawmakers passed a special law clearing the way for the construction despite legal hurdles.\n \n\n   \n  Vucic’s pro-Trump government says the project would boost the economy and ties with the US administration, which has imposed tariffs of 35% on imports from Serbia. It has also sanctioned Serbia’s monopoly oil supplier, which is controlled by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, critics say the building is an architectural monument, seen as a symbol of resistance to the US-led NATO bombing that remains widely viewed in the Balkan country as an unjust “aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Serbia’s government last year stripped the complex of protected status and signed a 99-year-lease agreement with Kushner-related Affinity Global Development in the US. But the redevelopment project came into question after Serbia’s organized crime prosecutors launched an investigation into whether documents used to remove that status were forged.\n \n\n   \n  The buildings are seen as prime examples of mid-20th century architecture in the former Yugoslavia. The protesters demanded that the protected heritage status for the complex be restored, and the buildings rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a warning that we will all defend these buildings together,” one of the students said. “We will be the human shield.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue has become the latest flashpoint in yearlong street protests that have shaken Vucic’s firm grip on power. Protesters have accused his government of rampant corruption in state projects. The protests started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad after renovation, killing 16 people.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of people marked the tragedy’s anniversary on Nov. 1 in Novi Sad.\n \n\n   \n  Serbia was bombed in 1999 for 78 days to force then-President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Anti-NATO sentiment remain strong in Serbia, and the US role in revamping the military buildings is particularly sensitive among many Serbians.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the government in Albania, another Balkan country, approved a $1.6 billion plan from Kushner’s company for a project to develop a luxury resort on a communist-era fortified island on the Adriatic coast.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-04:00","title":"India on Edge After Deadly Car Explosion in Capital Region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car explosion occurred near the historic Red Fort in Delhi on November 11, 2025, killing at least 10 people and injuring over 30.

Comments from top government officials on Tuesday have begun to suggest the act was a deliberate one.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from Bhutan, where he is on a visit, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “horrific incident” in Delhi “has deeply saddened everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy,” he said in Hindi, before breaking out into English: “All those responsible will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s defense minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the “findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The National Investigation Agency (NIA), India’s principal counter-terrorism law enforcement agency, is now handling the case.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time, Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said.\n \n\n   \n  At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi’s deputy fire chief.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time, Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard a big sound. Our windows shook,” one resident who did not give a name told Indian broadcaster NDTV, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  An ambulance driver said he could “only find bodies” when they reached the site of the blast.\n \n\n   \n  “The bodies were in parts, and we had to pick different parts and bring them back in the ambulances, and later brought them to the hospital,” he told local news agency ANI.\n \n\n   \n  One man said his nephew, an e-rickshaw driver, died in the blast. His family tried calling him late Monday but couldn’t get through.\n \n\n   \n  “When we came here, we had to identify the body,” he told ANI.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of the casualties could be seen weeping outside a local hospital.\n \n\n   \n    India on edge\n \n\n   \n  The ripple effect from Monday’s blast has been felt across India.\n \n\n   \n  Airports, railway stations, government buildings and heritage sites across the country have been put on high alert, according to the Central Industrial Security Force, and the Red Fort will remain  closed  for three days as the investigation continues. The US embassy in New Delhi is advising Americans to avoid the surrounding area as well as large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  The states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which neighbors Delhi, has also been put on high alert, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  Security arrangements “of important establishments, religious sites, crowded places, and other sensitive points” will be reviewed, Uttar Pradesh police  wrote  on X. The state, India’s most populous, is home to the Taj Mahal and other major tourist attractions.\n \n\n   \n  Haryana’s head of police, OP Singh, urged residents to “remain calm” and report any “suspicious person or unclaimed object” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The northwestern state of Rajasthan is also on high alert, its police department  said  on X.\n \n\n   \n  In the financial capital of Mumbai, train stations have been put on high alert, Reuters reported, citing authorities.\n \n\n   \n    Historic monument\n \n\n   \n  The Red Fort stands as one of India’s most significant historical landmarks.\n \n\n   \n  Originally built by Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace-fort of his capital, it served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Located in the heart of Old Delhi, the fort is located just a few kilometers from the Parliament of India.\n \n\n   \n  Today, it attracts thousands of daily visitors and holds immense symbolic value for the nation; its ramparts are where Indian prime ministers deliver their annual Independence Day speeches.\n \n\n   \n  While Monday’s blast is considered rare, Delhi has experienced blasts in previous decades, in which public areas, such as bus depots and crowded markets, were targeted.\n \n\n   \n  In 2001, India’s parliament was attacked by gunmen, killing more than a dozen people\n \n\n   \n  About 12 people were killed outside the Delhi High Court in a briefcase explosion in 2011.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-economy-biden-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:15","title":"Trump’s flailing on the economy is worse than Biden’s","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's recent dismissive and misleading comments on the economy—such as claiming inflation is fake and that polls showing public economic anxiety are 'con jobs by Democrats'—are more extreme than former President Joe Biden’s earlier downplaying of inflation as transitory.

He even called them a “con job by Democrats” and said the “polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Biden and his administration made a series of wayward predictions and comments about just how significant a problem inflation would prove to be. And they wound up paying a significant political price for their economic Pollyanna act.\n \n\n   \n  But the situations aren’t that analogous.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump has gone much further in his attempts to bury his head in the sand. And he seems to have a bigger problem politically speaking, for several reasons.\n \n\n   \n  No, the economy isn’t necessarily worse under Trump than it was under Biden. But Trump seems to have turned it into a bigger political liability.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration’s sins on this front were largely in its failure to recognize or convey how stubborn a problem inflation would be. Administration officials repeatedly and infamously used words like “transitory,” suggesting the problem would soon go away.\n \n\n   \n  “We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we’ve seen some price increases,” Biden  said in July 2021 . “Some folks have raised worries that could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that’s not our view.”\n \n\n   \n  Their view was wrong. The annual inflation rate climbed from about 5% when Biden made those remarks all the way over 9% about a year later. In the intervening months, the administration effectively  acknowledged its error .\n \n\n   \n  Trump, by contrast, isn’t just downplaying inflation or donning glasses that seem a couple of shades too rosy; he’s pretending the problem simply doesn’t exist.\n \n\n   \n  That escalated Monday when he was pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether Americans were right to be feeling the economic pinch. Trump basically suggested it was much ado about nothing.\n \n\n   \n  “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When Ingraham pointed to polls that show Americans are quite anxious about the economy, the president responded: “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote a good rundown Monday of Trump’s  nonstop string of lies  about this subject – lies that he repeated in the same Fox interview even as he accused others of misinformation. Trump has misstated a bevy of economic data points, including on inflation, grocery prices, energy prices and prescription drug prices. He keeps saying things like that there is no inflation or that grocery prices are down.\n \n\n   \n  (Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, claimed Monday when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that Trump merely meant  inflation  was down, rather than prices. But that’s not what Trump has said. And as Dale notes, inflation is not down.)\n \n\n   \n  Biden’s gamble was that his and his administration’s predictions could turn out to be wrong, which they did.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s gamble is that if he can’t convince people of his alternate version of reality, he risks looking completely out of touch.\n \n\n   \n  Which brings us to the other major difference with Biden.\n \n\n   \n  There is no question that inflation and the economy were political problems for the Democratic president; they likely helped deliver Trump the White House in 2024. But they appear to be even bigger political problems for Trump now.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are more likely to tie economic problems to Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  A number of recent polls have shown this:\n \n\n   \n  And despite Trump’s and his administration’s attempts to blame Biden for continuing economic pains, polls suggest Americans aren’t about to buy into that.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll  as far back as May showed that if the country were to fall into a recession, 59% of Americans would blame Trump, versus just 37% who would blame Biden.\n \n\n   \n  So why might Americans be more likely to attach economic pains to Trump than they did to Biden?\n \n\n   \n  There are a number of possible reasons.\n \n\n   \n  One is that Trump  pledged over and over to bring prices down quickly , and he clearly hasn’t done that.\n \n\n   \n  Another is that Biden might have benefited from Americans blaming at least some of the economic problems on the Covid-19 pandemic – which rocked the economy worldwide – rather than his policies.\n \n\n   \n  Another could be that Trump voluntarily took ownership of an already dicey economy by launching tariffs very early in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  But arguably the biggest reason is that Americans just haven’t seen Trump take on this issue head-on. CBS polling shows as many 75% of Americans say the Trump administration has focused “not enough” on lowering prices. That includes 57% of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  (At least Biden was doing things like getting Congress to pass a bill called the “Inflation Reduction Act” – regardless of whether it actually helped with inflation.)\n \n\n   \n  One way for Trump to respond to this data would be to double down on making affordability his focus. Another is to pretend 75% of Americans simply don’t know what they’re talking about or that the number is “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has apparently chosen the latter. It’s difficult to see how those around him would see it as their best option.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/weather/arctic-blast-chicago-snow-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"Record-breaking cold settles in across the southern US, but another big change is coming","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record-breaking cold snap has swept across the southern United States, with temperatures dropping as far south as Florida, including cities like Fort Myers, Miami, and Savannah, where daily record lows were set.

Record-breaking cold settles in across the southern US, but another big change is coming \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Record cold temperatures have pushed as far south as Florida this morning as wind-whipped snow continues to pile up in the eastern Great Lakes from a brief bout of Arctic air gripping the eastern US.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen cities, reaching as far south as Fort Myers, Miami and Naples, Florida, toppled or tied daily record lows for November 11.\n \n\n   \n  This morning is the coldest so early in the fall since 1976 in Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, with both locations dropping to a shivering 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The cold is causing South Florida’s cold-blooded iguanas to “freeze,” or lose muscle control. They can sometimes fall out of trees as a result, which some Floridians saw Tuesday morning. The iguanas are not dead, but rather in a paralyzed state and can revive if temperatures warm up fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  Cold conditions farther north have kicked the lake-effect snow machine into gear across the Great Lakes for the first time this year. Snow will contribute to dangerous travel conditions on Tuesday in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest snow has come to an end in the western Great Lakes. Up to a foot of snow fell more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  Chicago only picked up 1 to 3 inches of snow, which was accompanied by thunder and strong winds Sunday night into early Monday. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potentially historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are. That’s what happened Monday near Lake Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, over a foot of snow fell in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Several inches of snow have also piled up in the Appalachians from West Virginia to the border between North Carolina and Tennessee since Monday. Knoxville, Tennessee, saw its earliest accumulating snow since 1996 on Monday,  according to the National Weather Service . Snowflakes have flown through the air as far south as the Atlanta metro area on Monday, and along the North Carolina coast in Wilmington on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n    A temperature turnaround is ahead\n \n\n   \n  The good news: This cold snap won’t stick around long.\n \n\n   \n  Temperatures across the central and southern US will rebound quickly in the second half of this week as Arctic air releases its grip and warmer winds from out of the south return. Highs will be as much as 10 to 25 degrees above average from the Plains into the Midwest by Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A few cities in the Midwest that just saw their first snowflakes of the season could flirt with daily record high temperatures on Saturday. That includes Dubuque, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois, where thermometers are predicted to climb to near 70 degrees as the weekend begins.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the South will also return to shorts and T-shirt weather in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Highs in the lower 70s return to Nashville, Tennessee, by Friday, which is about 10 degrees above average. Much of the Florida Peninsula will see thermometers reach the upper 70s and lower 80s heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone in the East will feel this warmup. Temperatures in much of the Northeast are predicted to remain stubbornly cooler than average through the end of the week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/secret-lives-mormon-wives-season-3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Strap in because ‘The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ is bringing even more drama this season","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The third season of 'The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' returns with intensified drama, following the personal and emotional fallout from the 2022 scandal involving Taylor Frankie Paul's revelation of 'soft swinging' with her husband Tate and others in a Utah Mormon community.

2:32 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Things are heating up again in Utah.\n \n\n   \n  “The  Secret Lives of Mormon Wives ” is returning for its third season, which unfolds in some different locations (no spoilers here) but lacks absolutely no drama as the women try to balance personal relationships, work opportunities and the unique dynamics of being reality stars.\n \n\n   \n  The series began in 2024 thanks to Taylor Frankie Paul, who found scandal in 2022, when she announced via TikTok that she was getting divorced after she said she violated the terms of her open marriage. She also shared that she and her now ex-husband Tate had participated in “soft swinging” with other couples in their Utah community, which involved trading sexual partners in their social circle.\n \n\n   \n  Paul is credited with forming “MomTok” by pulling together a group of fellow Mormon mothers on TikTok. Many of the members have millions of followers, sharing glimpses into their lives for lucrative sponsorships.\n \n\n   \n  The first season of “Mormon Wives” last year focused on the fallout from Paul’s scandalous revelation, as well as her subsequent pregnancy with boyfriend Dakota Mortensen, with whom she became involved while married.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward Season 3, and lots has changed as viewers witnessed the toxicity between Paul and Mortensen over the past two seasons and the recent announcement that she  is the next Bachelorette. \n \n\n   \n  Paul’s fellow cast members Layla Taylor and Miranda McWhorter offered support in her attempt to find love on another reality show.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Taylor deserves to find an actual pure example of love in somebody that respects her in and out of the room that she’s in,” Taylor said. “I feel like Taylor’s (Frankie Paul) just deserving of that. So we’re excited. We’re so excited.”\n \n\n   \n  McWhorter agreed, which means something as she and her now ex-husband Chase were a big part of the “soft swinging” scandal that kicked the show off. She told CNN, “You gotta be okay with whatever skeletons you got in that closet coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have to authentic and open and real about everything. I think the more reserved you are this might not be for you. And it’s hard,” McWhorter said. “This is a hard world to be in. You have people that are judging you off of how you handle situations, off of how you operate. And it’s hard because people are only seeing such small glimpses into who you are as a person.”\n \n\n   \n  New “Bachelorette” Paul is not the only one who has gotten a reality crossover.\n \n\n   \n  Cast members Jennifer Affleck and Whitney Leavitt were selected to compete on the most recent season of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck spoke with CNN soon after she was eliminated from the dance competition.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely a different vibe and it’s a different hard because with the ‘Secret Lives’ it can be very draining in the sense that there’s a lot of drama and it’s uncomfortable in that sense,” Affleck said. “But ‘Dancing With the Stars’ is uncomfortable in the sense that it’s not only mentally demanding, but also it’s very physical.”\n \n\n   \n  She said she loved how positive “DWTS” was because “everyone tries to stray away from drama and that was kind of nice for me to be able to be on a reality TV show that doesn’t fixate on drama.”\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 also includes the heightened drama of finding out what really happened regarding allegations of Jessi Ngatikaura being unfaithful to her husband and the unraveling of her and some of the other women’s relationship with Demi Engemann, who has had tension with more than a few of them.\n \n\n   \n  Ngatikaura admitted to having “all the emotions” about her personal life playing out on air.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m nervous clearly, because it’s a big story to share and I have no idea what the opinions will be,” she told CNN. “But I’m also relieved that it’ll be out there because it’s kind of been like a secret and no one’s known my dynamic and what happened in my relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  “So at least it’ll be out there and I can talk about it openly, but I have no idea what the audience is going to feel,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” debuts Thursday on Hulu.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/world/blast-islamabad-pakistan-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:42:00-05:00","title":"At least 12 killed in Islamabad suicide attack – the most deadly assault in the Pakistani capital since 2008","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A suicide bombing in Islamabad’s High Court parking lot killed 12 people and injured over 20, marking the deadliest such attack in the city in nearly two decades.

Then, in a split second, a security guard helped him get to hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was passing the police station close to the courts, I saw the police car pass me and I saw a man go towards it wearing his jacket,” Abbas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw about 40 people fall immediately,” he added. “I had been hit as well and bled a lot. But thank goodness I was saved.”\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif stated on X that Pakistan is in a “state of war” and that this attack should be taken as a “wake-up call” with regards to negotiations with neighboring Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “The rulers of Kabul can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which—praise be to God—Pakistan has the full strength to respond,” the Pakistani defense minister added.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement expressing “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding both the attack in Islamabad as well as the attack on the cadet college in the country’s northwest. The statement from Afghanistan did not address the remarks of Pakistan’s defence minister.\n \n\n   \n  Both the embassies of China and the United States condemned the attack. The US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said in a statement that “the United States stands in solidarity with Pakistan in the struggle against terrorism.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his condolences to the victims’ families and called for a full investigation, his spokesman said.\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between the Pakistani and Afghan militaries in October saw the worst violence between the two countries in years.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to maintain a ceasefire fell apart when peace talks between the two neighbors failed in Istanbul last week following the failure to establish a long-term deal regarding hostile militant groups in Afghanistan that operate against Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion came  less than a day after militants attacked a cadet college in northwestern Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/europe/british-journalist-hamdi-ice-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:45:00-05:00","title":"British Journalist Sami Hamdi Expected to Be Released from ICE Detention and Return to UK","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, a commentator on Middle Eastern affairs, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on October 26, 2025, after being accused of overstaying his visa during a speaking tour.

journalist Sami Hamdi, who has been held by US federal immigration for over two weeks, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The London-based journalist and commentator, who was visiting the United States on a speaking tour,  was detained  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month as he went through San Francisco International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. But Muslim advocacy groups say that his visa was revoked during his trip without cause or prior notice. Hamdi’s family believe his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories was the real reason behind the decision.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Hamdi had opted to accept a US government offer to leave the country voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  “The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country” in a statement Monday. McLaughlin characterized Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE records show Hamdi was still in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer on Monday welcomed the US decision to release the British national.\n \n\n   \n  “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said she was optimistic her husband would be home before the end of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We as a family are enormously relieved that our beloved Sami will soon be returning home, after the US government agreed to release him voluntarily, with no order of deportation and no allegations,” she told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV.  He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration.

But suspending funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, may have long-lasting impacts, say some experts and those who depend on the program to feed their families.     \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Jacqueline Giammona, a single working mom of two boys, relies on SNAP for most of her groceries. By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.   The Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court. \"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\" Giammona   can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences. \"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said. SNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need. Funded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University. \"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said.   \"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden expanded it by \" Billions and Billions of dollars \" and that benefits were given randomly \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\" In late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments. Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\" \"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said. The administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would   cover roughly half  of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.   The deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic. \"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\" Ideally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown. \"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026. \" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some advocates also worry the SNAP disruption will dissuade people who face hunger from getting help.   \"By making SNAP payments uncertain the shutdown will likely further decrease the number of eligible people who will apply,\" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit Hunger Free America. The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment about concerns over mistrust in the program   and plans to address that. The weeks of hardship, anxiety and chaos caused by the funding pause have, however, shined a light on the importance of the program, many noted. SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from  both major parties .   \"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen. Brittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them. Jansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her husband racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends part-time, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care for their two toddlers. Her own mother didn't fully grasp the struggle. \"When I first told her that we were getting benefits she was confused,\" Jansen said, \"because she was like, 'Well, you both have jobs!'\" Since the shutdown and SNAP funding pause, Jansen has been more open about the fact that her family needs help. \"And I think people are just kind of surprised,\" she said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5407493","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00-05:00","title":"The U.S. Just Produced Its Last Penny After a More Than 200-Year Run","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Mint has produced its final penny in 2025, ending a 200-year tradition of minting one-cent coins.

The Treasury Department says it's soon planning to stop minting pennies. The copper-colored coins have been in production for more than 200 years, but cash of all kinds is less popular for making payments today. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now with his two cents on this. Scott, so why is the Treasury Department making this move? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, A. It does seem like a big move. The federal government's been minting pennies since 1793, but the coins have become a money-loser. Each one costs almost 4 cents to make, and the government makes billions of them. So by phasing out the penny, the Treasury Department says it expects to save about $56 million a year in material costs, and it hopes to pinch even more pennies down the road through more efficient operations at the mint. MARTÍNEZ: All right, so what's going to happen to all the pennies that are on my - that are on my cabinet? HORSLEY: Yeah, they're - don't worry. They're still legal tender, and that is a relief to you and others because there are an estimated 114 billion pennies out there in the economy. But most don't really circulate. They just sit around gathering dust, like... (SOUNDBITE OF PENNIES RATTLING) HORSLEY: ...The ones I keep... MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter). HORSLEY: ...In the Don Francisco coffee can on my dresser. And, frankly, that's part of the problem, A. Most people don't use the pennies they already have, so the pennies don't change hands. Then stores have to go to the bank and ask for more pennies to make change, and the government has to keep minting them. MARTÍNEZ: So what will businesses do when they can't get more pennies from the government? HORSLEY: Well, they might have to round prices up or down a little bit. You know, maybe we'll see fewer price tags that say $1.99 or 19.99. Luckily, we do have some experience with this. Other countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand phased out their 1-cent coins years ago, and it turns out it's not really a big deal. Keep in mind, more and more people are now using forms of payment other than cash, whether that's credit cards, debit cards or a smartphone app. And according to the Federal Reserve, even for small purchases, under $25 now, shoppers are equally likely to pay with a credit card or a debit card as they are with cash. MARTÍNEZ: Maybe we can get pennies from heaven... HORSLEY: (Laughter) MARTÍNEZ: ...Instead of from the government. That could be another option. Let's just put a pin on that one. So, OK, is getting rid of pennies a step forward maybe toward getting rid of cash altogether? HORSLEY: Probably not - at least not anytime soon. Cash is still used for about 14% of all payments, according to the Fed. Not surprisingly, older people and lower-income families are more likely to use cash than younger, wealthier customers. Whatever your age or income, though, if you start fishing around for a lot of pennies in the checkout line, you're probably going to get some nasty looks from other customers or the cashier. I should mention, pennies are not the only coin the government loses money on. It costs about 14 cents to mint a nickel, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a House committee earlier this month he does think there is a way to break even on those. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT BESSENT: We have looked at this, and we believe that it is possible by changing the composition of the nickel to bring down the cost to 5 cents or less. HORSLEY: And Bessent says the government still makes a profit on dimes. MARTÍNEZ: Is ditching the penny a dig at Abraham Lincoln? HORSLEY: Luckily, Lincoln still has the $5 bill. He was actually the first president to be featured on a coin back in 1909, which was the centennial of his birth. Of course, it was Ben Franklin who said a penny saved is a penny earned, or words to that effect. Franklin's face is on the hundred-dollar bill, and those aren't going anywhere. MARTÍNEZ: Scott, I'd offer you a penny for your thoughts. It costs too much, so just a thank you. That's NPR's Scott Horsley. HORSLEY: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97607","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"21:46:00-05:00","title":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history comes to a close","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days and ending on November 12, 2025, was concluded with a bipartisan bill passed by the House and signed by President Trump.

\n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has signed a bill to fund the government, bringing a close to the longest government shutdown in history, one that saw millions of Americans affected and ended with little political gain. The bill passed Wednesday night   despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats   joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York. Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209. President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.  \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\" In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a  court battle  because of the shutdown. The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs. But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown —  extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year  — is not addressed in the bill. Instead, as part of the  deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators , Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies. That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure. Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. A lot of pain, not a lot of gain Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception. The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown  in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government. With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table. But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government. In the meantime,  42 million Americans who participate with SNAP  didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's  order to scale back flights . Millions of federal workers went without pay. The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient. Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care. \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\" Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he  took a step back  during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who  repeatedly   asked   where   Trump  \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions. What happens now?  Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year. Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage. If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year. Some Republicans have shown  interest  in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps. And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live music performances from various artists on a popular NPR program.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Live Music","Featured Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5605582","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00-05:00","title":"White House downplays new Epstein emails that mention Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrat-led House Oversight Committee released new emails and documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate that include references to President Donald Trump, raising questions about a personal or political relationship.

During a press briefing, Leavitt reiterated that the emails \"prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong\" and said the administration \"has done more with respect to transparency when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein than any administration ever.\" In September, House Democrats  released more than 200 pages  of a birthday book for Epstein created more than two decades ago that includes a lewd drawing and letter that appears to be signed by Trump.  The president, who has consistently denied any meaningful connection to Epstein, called the drawing and signature \"fake.\"  Trump has been criticized for paying little heed to his own supporters who have called for a full release of files kept on Epstein and his alleged crimes, before and after he died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. In July, Trump   told reporters  that he and Epstein fell out because Epstein hired away young female employees who worked at the spa at Mar-a-Lago. The release timed with House votes The latest Epstein files revelation comes as the House returns to session for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history.  House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began in October.  But House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay the vote by keeping the chamber out for seven weeks, and most recently by refusing to swear in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Grijalva is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday afternoon. Critics on both sides of the aisle viewed Johnson's refusal as a means of avoiding the vote to direct the Department of Justice to release the Epstein documents. On the campaign trail, Grijalva, who won a special election Sept. 23, promised to sign onto the bipartisan petition spearheaded by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to force a House vote on the Epstein matter. Grijalva's signature marked the 218th one needed to force a vote on the matter. The Epstein files continue to be a political thorn in the president's side, after Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released several emails from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that refer to President Trump. They raise new questions about the extent of their relationship. NPR's Stephen Fowler has taken a look at those emails, and he's here to explain the context. So, Stephen, what do these documents claim to show? STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Well, these new Epstein emails appear to reveal more connections to the disgraced financier. It's part of a 23,000-document release turned over from Epstein's estate to the House Oversight Committee. There's a 2015 email thread between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, where the pair discuss a potential question from an upcoming CNN interview with Trump about Trump and Epstein's personal ties. A section from Wolff reads in part, quote, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,\" end quote. There's another email, A, that Epstein sent in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell - his associate who was also convicted on trafficking charges - that called Trump the dog that hasn't barked and says Trump spent, quote, \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex-trafficking victims. There's a 2019 email between Epstein and Wolff that saw the disgraced financier write that, quote, \"of course\" Trump \"knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.\" The email does not elaborate further, and it's important to note here that NPR has not independently confirmed the veracity of the correspondence. MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, the House is set to return to action after seven weeks of recess. How does this document dump fit into that? FOWLER: These latest Epstein files come as the House returns for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began, but House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay that vote by keeping the chamber out and most recently by refusing to swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Now, Grijalva will be sworn in this afternoon, and there will be enough votes to move forward with this bipartisan Epstein files petition. Ranking member Robert Garcia said in a statement that, quote, \"the more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" and added that the latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president. MARTÍNEZ: So speaking to that relationship, walk us through the timeline of the previous revelations about the Epstein files and the president's political issues with that topic. FOWLER: Well, in September, House Democrats released more than 200 pages of a birthday book for Epstein, created more than two decades ago, that included a lewd drawing and letter that appears to be signed by Trump. The president has consistently denied any meaningful connection to Epstein, the veracity of the birthday book, and has paid little heed to his own supporters, who have called for a full release of the files kept on Epstein and his alleged crimes, both before and after he died by suicide in 2019 in federal custody. In July, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein fell out because Epstein hired away young female employees who worked at the spa at Mar-a-Lago. And as another reminder, A, Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth. And people across the ideological spectrum feel like that is now a promise that Trump has broken. MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Stephen, thanks. FOWLER: Thank you. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 12th, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misspelled Ghislaine Maxwell's name.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5561978","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:53:00-05:00","title":"Some Black Police Officials Worry More Federal Agents Will Breed Community Mistrust","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In St. Louis, Black police officials and community members are deeply concerned about the deployment of federal immigration agents and Missouri’s National Guard in immigrant and predominantly Black communities, despite a significant decline in violent crime.

Some Black police officials worry more federal agents will breed community mistrust \n         By Andrea Henderson \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 6:53 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Jaiden Booth has been keeping a close eye on viral videos in cities across the country where National Guard and immigration enforcement agents have been deployed, especially how people of color are being treated during immigration raids and protests. Over the past few months, Booth, a St. Louis resident, said he has seen federal agents and unmarked vehicles in various immigrant communities around the city, which pushed him to start preparing to better support vulnerable people. He came to a recent federal enforcement safety town hall in a St. Louis gym hosted by local activists and immigration lawyers to learn more about trainings to monitor ICE activity. Booth is opposed to immigration agents or National Guard members policing communities of color, because he said it does not make them safer. Booth fears that the presence of troops and federal agents could set the stage for more negative interactions with Black Americans, including harassment or mistreatment. And this is also a concern for some Black police officials across the country. Like in most American cities,  crime is down  in St. Louis. Over the past year, violent and property crimes decreased, and the city's homicide rate is the lowest it has been in years. There have been 123 murders in 2025 to date, compared to 224 in 2020, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Even with crime trending downward, President Trump suggested in September that St. Louis needs help addressing crime. \"We've got to save these cities,\" Trump said during a recent interview in the Oval Office. \"This isn't like, you know, we're gonna do something … We have to save St. Louis.\" On Oct. 1, Missouri's Republican governor  activated the state's National Guard  to help ICE agents with clerical duties. St. Louis Public Radio  reported  that 15 guardsmen will help ICE with tasks such as data entry, logistical support and case management. Neither the governor's office nor the state's National Guard responded to a request for an interview. The aggressive push to send troops into Democratic-led cities and their communities of color drives a wedge between police and residents, said Donny Walters, president of Ethical Society of Police, St. Louis' Black police officers union. \"This type of heavy-handed tactic is pushing us backwards instead of bringing us closer together,\" Walters said. \"What should be done from our federal government is they should be giving us resources to help our Black and brown communities [as] opposed to feeling like, 'Oh, we got to do more enforcement.'\" He is concerned that if federal agents or National Guardsmen mistreat Black St. Louisans or other communities of color, it will erode the trust Black police officers worked hard to build. \"Let's say they come in for six weeks, and whatever they are doing, however they are doing it, when they leave, we now are left with the fallout,\" he said. \"We're now left with dealing with the community after the fact.\" Some Black police officers say there are other ways to drive down crime, and that interventions should be led by city leaders and social service organizations. \"No city is without its challenges, but what we recognize is across this country, we have seen a decline in violent crime and other crimes throughout the cities, and it's due to the work that has been done by mayors, city managers and police chiefs,\" said Renee Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. Hall said the aggressive tactics used by troops and federal agents resembles policing during the Jim Crow era. She said Black communities have been historically over-policed, and described this as a legacy of American slavery. \"And so now we're deploying those same kinds of tactics that resemble the 1940s and 1950s,\" Hall said. \"It just sends the wrong message in the United States, when we have done so much work in law enforcement to step away from those stereotypes … and it's performative and it doesn't get us the results that most Americans are looking for, and that is actual results of reducing crime.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97572","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-05:00","title":"Chess Federation Accuses Former Champion Kramnik of Harassing Rival Who Died","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Chess Federation (FIDE) has formally filed a complaint against former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, accusing him of harassment and the insulting of an individual's dignity after he made unproven allegations of cheating against Daniel Naroditsky, a prominent American grandmaster and online chess educator.

The complaint centers on harassment and \"the insulting of an individual's dignity,\" said the International Chess Federation, known by the acronym FIDE, in a news release. Naroditsky's cause of death has not been made public. Kramnik accused Naroditsky, an American grandmaster of cheating last year and continued to share suspicions on social media. Naroditsky, a prodigious chess player who helped usher in the game's online boom with educational YouTube videos and livestreams, denied the allegations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In his last livestream before his death, Naroditsky said that Kramnik's allegations had taken a toll on him. \"Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\" Naroditsky said. Other chess grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Nihal Sarin, have called out Kramnik's conduct, saying the Russian player had harassed Naroditsky. Kramnik did not immediately respond to requests for comment submitted through his GoFundMe page for his campaign against cheating, but he previously called the federation's investigation \"insulting and unfair.\" The complaint, submitted to the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission, describes a \"pattern of conduct over roughly two years\" related to possible harassment, read the federation's statement. It includes testimony provided by Czech grandmaster David Navara, whom Kramnik also accused of cheating, and \"people close to Daniel Naroditsky.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The federation may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. It also requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky. The governing body previously said it had referred Kramnik's statements, before and after Naroditsky's death, to the ethics commission.

Someone who – simply through good conversation – gets you to open up? Makes you feel smarter, more interesting or just understood?  These are all common traits of \"supercommunicators\" — people who are consistently able to create authentic connections with others just by listening and talking. They're the topic of a new book published this month,  Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection , by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg.  You don't need a specific personality type — like being outgoing or chatty — to be an effective conversationalist, says Duhigg in his book. \"It's just a set of skills that anyone can learn,\" like asking deep questions or being vulnerable.   \n       \n      Related Story:  Oops, I messed up! 7 common public speaking issues — and how to fix them \n       You'll want to master these skills, he says, because they can help you bond with others in \"a profound way that makes life so much more meaningful.\" In fact, studies have shown that when people have positive personal relationships and feel connected to their communities – a feat made possible through good communication – they tend to  have happier, healthier and longer lives .  Duhigg, who drew on scientific research, psychology and interviews with people whose jobs rely on communication (like executives and spies) to write his book, shares four habits of supercommunicators.  1. They know what kind of conversation they're having One key trait of supercommunicators is that they know what kind of conversation they're having — and are therefore able to respond accordingly, says Duhigg. Generally, conversations tend to fall into three categories.  Practical conversations:  Let's say you are talking to a friend who is complaining about work. If you were having a practical conversation, your friend might ask you to help problem-solve and make hard decisions. They may ask straightforward questions like, \"What do you think I should do about my boss?\" If you're in this type of conversation, be ready to give good advice.   Emotional conversations:  People engaging in these types of discussions are seeking empathy, not answers, says Duhigg. If your friend who is complaining about work is expressing their feelings and saying things like, \"I'm so frustrated this is happening!\" or \"my work environment is so stressful!\" you may want to show your support by being a good listener.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Good conversations take time and attention. Here's how to have better ones  \n       Social conversations:  Any time you're, say, gossiping about office politics, discussing relationships with friends or sharing how your family background influences your identity, you're having a social conversation. These discussions reflect \"how we see others and how other people see us,\" says Duhigg. If you're in this type of dialogue, be mindful of the different perspectives each person brings to the table and seek common ground.  2. They 'prove' they're listening There are plenty of ways to  appear  like you're listening, says Duhigg, like making eye contact or nodding intently. But  proving  to someone that you're listening is the quickest road to making someone feel heard. To do that, he suggests a technique called \"looping for understanding .\"  First, ask someone a question and then listen to their response. Next, repeat back in your own words what they just told you. Lastly – and this is the step that people usually forget, he says – ask your conversation partner if you got what they said correct.  This practice might sound fairly simple, but it packs a big punch, says Duhigg. \"When we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak,\" he says. So if you can show someone you genuinely want to understand them, it creates trust — even if you both completely disagree with each other.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How to have tricky conversations \n       3. They ask (a lot of) the right questions  Research shows that highly effective communicators tend to ask  10 to 20 times  as many questions as everyone else. They may simply be follow-up questions that signal to the other person that you're interested in the conversation, like \"So did you make it on time?\" or \"What happened next?\"  Supercommunicators also ask questions that get people to open up. Duhigg calls these \"deep questions.\" They \"ask about people's values, beliefs or experiences\" and \"spark an opportunity for emotional connection.\"  This might sound overly intimate, especially if you're talking to a stranger, but he says it doesn't have to be. Be intentional with your framing and take time to think of \"the real question instead of the rote question.\"  Let's say you've met an acquaintance at a party. Instead of just asking what they do for a living, ask, \"Do you love what you do?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Want to listen better? Turn down your thoughts and tune in to others \n       When in doubt, Duhigg says to just ask \"why.' Generally, people love to talk about how they see the world. \"What I've found is that within three questions you can get to something real if you ask 'why,' \" he says. \"And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from.\" 4. They aim to understand For a supercommunicator, the goal of a discussion isn't to impress someone, convince someone or wait for their turn to speak, says Duhigg. It's to genuinely comprehend someone else's point of view and share their own views  accordingly.  Let's say you mention to your co-worker that you're stressed about your childcare situation. Many people might breeze past an emotional comment, feign curiosity or offer empty platitudes. But a supercommunicator would sit with the emotion you offer them. They might ask you a deep question about your situation and then offer a story about some of their own struggles at home.  This kind of response, says Duhigg, creates an atmosphere of trust, vulnerability and openness that both parties can benefit from. It says, \"if you know I want to understand you, you're going to want to understand me.\"  \"And that is actually the most magical thing that can happen,\" he adds.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Hey there. Stacey Vanek Smith here in for Marielle Segarra. When you are having a bad day, who do you call? Who is that person who makes you feel better, maybe someone who really listens to you? I'm guessing there's a name or a face that's popped into your mind right now. CHARLES DUHIGG: Yeah. Me, too. I think everyone listening probably has someone. And for you, that person is a supercommunicator. And you're probably a supercommunicator back to them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANEK SMITH: Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the bestselling author of \"The Power Of Habit.\" His new book, \"Supercommunicators,\" is a guide to how to unlock the secret language of connection. The secret to real, authentic connection? I mean, it's not such a big secret. We have all had those amazing conversations at one time or another, felt that buzz when your ideas are really in sync with a colleague, or that amazing feeling when you have a conversation with your partner and you feel like they really get you. DUHIGG: But there are some people who can do this more consistently with basically anyone. And what we've learned is that it's not an inborn trait. It's not that introverts can do it better than extroverts or vice versa. Rather, there are some people who have just paid a little bit more attention to how they communicate with other people and how others communicate with them. VANEK SMITH: And those people, those supercommunicators, they're the people for whom doors of opportunity often open up a lot more readily, people who build and maintain genuine connections, says Charles. They live longer, happier, fuller lives. And all it takes to start is some authentic conversation. DUHIGG: Listening to their own instincts and saying, the goal of this discussion ought to be not to impress you, not to make you think I'm smart, not to convince you that I'm right. The goal of this conversation should be to understand you. And if you know that I want to understand you, you're going to want to understand me. And that is actually the most magical thing that can happen. VANEK SMITH: In this episode of LIFE KIT, we take a look at how to be a supercommunicator. Reporter Andee Tagle talks to Charles Duhigg about connection, conversation, and the power of asking good questions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE: Charles, let's talk a little bit about the power of connection. I think everyone would agree that it's nice to have a nice conversation, but that's different than real, meaningful connection, right? I'm really fascinated by the physiological effects that connecting can have on people. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? DUHIGG: Yeah, absolutely. So when we really connect with someone in conversation, when we are sort of on what you might refer to as the same wavelength, what's interesting is it's reflected in our bodies and our brains. So right now, we're having a conversation even though we're separated by hundreds of miles. And yet if we could measure this, what we would see is that your eye pupils and my eye pupils are starting to dilate at the same rate. Our breath patterns are starting to match each other. Our heart rates are starting to match each other. And even more importantly, if we could see inside our brains, what we would see is that my brainwaves are starting to look like your brainwaves and vice versa. Within psychology and neurology, this is known as neural entrainment, and it's at the core of how we communicate with each other. And what it tells us is that communication is connection. When you and I are really communicating with each other, our bodies and our brains become connected in a way that allows us to understand and hear each other much more clearly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: So, Takeaway 1, communication is connection. We tend to think that the goal of a conversation is to make a point or say your opinion. But Charles says that's not a good way to judge the success of an interaction. Instead, in order to really connect, aim to have what he calls a learning conversation. DUHIGG: A conversation is successful if I understand you and you understand me. And what's really nice about that is that if you go in with this attitude of wanting to have a learning conversation, where my goal is simply to learn how you see the world and to share with you how I see the world so you can learn my perspectives, then it takes away all this pressure. I don't have to convince you to vote for my guy. I don't have to convince you to support my issue. I don't have to convince you to support my team. Instead, what I want to do is I want to understand how you see the world. And there's tactics that help us do that. One of my favorite ways of doing this, particularly if you're having a conversation amid conflict is something known as looping for understanding. And what it is - it has three steps. You should ask someone a question, and some questions are more powerful than others. You should listen to what they say. And then step No. 2, you should repeat back in your own words what they just told you. And then step No. 3, and this is the one we usually forget, is you should ask them if you got it right. The reason this is so powerful is because particularly when we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak. But if it's a learning conversation, a conversation where I really want to understand you, if I start proving to you that I'm listening, proving that I want to understand, and then asking you to make sure that I'm getting this right, that I genuinely do understand, both of us are going to trust each other more, even if we completely disagree with each other. TAGLE: So, let me make sure that I have that right. That was looping for understanding, where we're actively showing people that we're listening to them by, you know, paying attention, by asking follow-up questions and making sure that we have that information correct. Is that correct? DUHIGG: That's exactly - so, yes... TAGLE: How'd we do? DUHIGG: So ask a question. You did a good job. You did a good job. Ask a question and then repeat back what you heard them say in your own words, as you just did, and then ask if you got it right. So you are a super communicator. You do this really well. TAGLE: We're doing OK. Thanks so much, Charles. We're hanging in there. We're hanging in there. That's wonderful. DUHIGG: (Laughter). TAGLE: Let's move on to the matching principle, which I know is a big part of super communicating. Matching isn't as simple as mimicking someone's body language, right? DUHIGG: Yeah, absolutely. So one of the best examples is how I came to this book, because I felt like I was having some communication problems in my life. And one in particular, a pattern that I found was happening again and again is, I would come home after a tough day at work and I would start complaining to my wife and I would say, you know, my boss is a jerk and my coworkers don't appreciate me. And she very reasonably would say, oh, you know, why don't you take your boss out for lunch and get to know each other a little bit better? She would try and solve my problem. And instead of listening to her, what I would do is I would get even more upset. I would say, you know, no, I want you to be outraged on my behalf. I want you to be - to support me. And she would get upset because I was acting irrational. She was giving me good advice. And so when I went to researchers and I asked them about this, what they said is like, well, here's the problem. People tend to think of a discussion as being about one thing. It's about my day, or it's about Jimmy's grades or where to go on vacation. But actually every discussion is made up of multiple different kinds of conversations. And in particular, those conversations tend to fall into one of three buckets. There's practical conversations, where we're solving problems or we're making plans. There's emotional discussions where I might share how I'm feeling, and I don't want you to solve my problem. I want you to listen and empathize. And then there's social conversations where we're talking about how we see each other in the context of society. And other people see us. And they said, look, when you were coming home, you were having an emotional conversation. You wanted to talk about how you feel. And your wife responded with a practical conversation. And both of those conversations are totally valid. But because you were having different conversations at the same moment, you couldn't really hear each other. And so the answer is, what you mentioned, the matching principle - that once we figure out what kind of conversation is occurring, that if I match you or I invite you to match me, that's where we really are able to hear each other. TAGLE: Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone. Is it a practical, emotional, social? Once you understand their goals, it'll be easier to really connect. Here's how to decipher one from the other. You say in the book that we all send clues as we speak to other people about what conversation we want to have, right? DUHIGG: Yeah. TAGLE: Can you give us some tools to be better conversation sleuths? You know... DUHIGG: Yes. TAGLE: ...What should we look out for in ourselves and in other people to determine where a conversation is headed? DUHIGG: There's one tactic in particular that's really helpful in figuring out what kind of a conversation is happening. What does this other person want and need, and what do I want out of this discussion? There's certain kinds of questions that are special. These are known as deep questions. To figure out what everyone wants from a conversation, you should ask deep questions. And a deep question is something that asks about people's values or beliefs or experiences. And that can sound kind of scary, right? That sounds pretty intimate, but it's actually pretty... TAGLE: Yeah. DUHIGG: ...Easy to do. If you meet someone who's new, and you ask them, what do you do for a living? And they say, I'm a lawyer, you can ask, oh, you know, what made you decide to become a lawyer? Like, did you always want to be a lawyer? Do you love your job? Those three questions - they're asking that person to talk about their values and their beliefs, the experiences that led them to law school, whether they enjoy going to work each day, what they enjoy about it. They're easy questions to ask. But when we respond to them, we describe so much about ourselves. And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from. The difference between someone who says, oh, I decided to become a lawyer because, you know, I grew up a little bit poor, and I always wanted to have a steady job. I wanted to be able to provide for my family. That person is in a practical frame of mind. They're having a practical conversation. But someone else who says, I decided to become a lawyer because I saw my dad get arrested, and I wanted to fight for the underdog. That person is in a more emotional or maybe even social state of mind. We should have a different kind of conversation with them. It's easy to ask deep questions, easier than we think it is. But more importantly, we learn what this other person is seeking out of this conversation, and we get to share with them what we want as well. TAGLE: It sounds like what you're talking about is the idea of emotional reciprocity, right? DUHIGG: Yes, absolutely. So if someone says, you know - if someone shares something with us that's a little bit vulnerable, we should acknowledge that we've heard that. If they say - if we ask, how was this weekend? And they say, oh, it was a little bit of a tough weekend. And we ask, why? What happened? You know, what was going on? And they say, well, I had to go to a funeral. At that moment, what we should do is rather than skip... TAGLE: Avoid it at all costs, right? DUHIGG: ...Yeah, is lean in a little bit and say, oh, I'm so sorry. Like, tell me about the person. What did they mean to you? And then we can share about ourselves and we can say, you know, my father - and this is actually true - my father passed away six years ago. And one of the things that's been really fascinating to me is how much my relationship with him has continued after his death. Now we're, you know, 45 seconds, a minute into a conversation and we're talking about something real, something where we can get to know each other and understand each other a little bit better. And that emotional reciprocity is at the core of how we learn to trust and like each other. (SOUINDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway three - ask deep questions. That means going beyond your go-to small talk, but you don't have to do that on the fly. Charles recommends preparing for conversations. DUHIGG: There was a study that was done at Harvard Business School, where they asked students before they had a conversation with a stranger. They asked all the students to write down three topics that they thought they could discuss. This took like 10 seconds, right? People would write down, like, you know, this weekend's game and what TV shows I watch, just little dumb throwaway things. And then they went and they had conversations with strangers, and everyone would put the card away. Many of them would put it in their back pocket. And the topics they had jotted down often never came up. But the fact that they were there almost overwhelmingly made all of the participants feel less anxious about those discussions. And as a result, those discussions went much, much better. Oftentimes when we're thinking about talking to someone, when we're thinking about a conversation, particularly a hard conversation - right? - a serious one, we can get really anxious about it because we don't know how it's going to go. And if we just sit down and we just think a little bit, you know, I'm calling up my friend Greg, and I really want to find out, like, if he has any plans for this summer, and I hope that it's just an easy, light conversation. That takes four seconds for me to decide before I start dialing. But studies show it'll make the conversation go better. Because I'm prepared. I'm prepared for what arises. But I also know what I want, and I'm prepared to listen to what he wants. TAGLE: Such a simple thing - you know, if you're nervous, just having a couple topics in your back pocket can make it easier, can make you feel more at ease. DUHIGG: It makes all the difference in the world. I've been thinking about this a lot with conversations with my kids. So I have a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old. They come home from school and, like, I go into auto mode sometimes where I'm like, hey, how was school today? It was fine. Do you have any homework? Yes. I - without even thinking about it, I start asking all these un-deep questions. And so now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to - before my kids get home, I try and think up, like, what's the question that I can ask my son that he actually wants to answer? And sometimes that question is things like, you know, who do you think is the best basketball player of all time? Which is apropos of nothing, but he loves to answer. TAGLE: (Laughter). DUHIGG: And sometimes it's like, hey, you know, I - you mentioned that you went skateboarding with your friends after school. And I'm just wondering, like, Jasper - he seems like a really good friend of yours. Like, what is it about Jasper you like so much? Like, what do you admire about Jasper? When I think and try and come up with these slightly deeper questions, it's as if I've unlocked something in my kids, and suddenly they start telling me about why they like some of their friends and drama with other friends. And then we have real conversations, and then I can tell them about when I was a kid, which they're hopefully fascinated by and sometimes bored by. But it just takes, like, 10 seconds to come up with the real question as opposed to the, the rote question, which is how is school? Do you have homework? So I try and do that more. TAGLE: Just to take a little bit of time - I love that. What about for people who don't - for which that creative question isn't readily available? You know, like, for a stranger, for someone you don't totally know - I mean, you can do a little bit of your research, but if you're not quite sure what's going to open them up, what... DUHIGG: Yeah. TAGLE: ...Any advice there? DUHIGG: So there's a guy named Nicholas Epley, who's a professor at the University of Chicago who's studied this exact question his whole career. And what he's found is that almost any question that asks why helps people open up. So as I mentioned, you know, what do you do for a living? I'm a lawyer. Oh, yeah? Why did you decide to become a lawyer? You know, what did you have for lunch today? I had grilled cheese. Oh, yeah? Why did you decide to have grilled cheese? When we ask why, what we're doing is we're inviting the other person to explain who they are. And it can - when I'm describing it this way, it can seem like, oh, maybe that's harder than it is. Maybe that's more awkward than it is. But what Nick has found is that within three questions - between strangers, between close friends, between people who have nothing in common - within three questions, you can get to something real if you ask why. And it's always easy to ask why. People love to be asked why. Because they love to talk about how they see the world. TAGLE: Charles, could we practice? DUHIGG: Of course. TAGLE: Within three questions. OK. DUHIGG: OK. TAGLE: Charles, what did you do this weekend? DUHIGG: You know, I was in Los Angeles, and I flew back on Saturday. TAGLE: Why were you in LA? DUHIGG: Oh, so I was out there - I was actually promoting my book. I was going on podcasts, and I was talking to folks. And, kind of - it was kind of amazing because I used to live in LA and a chance to go out there and be back there - it's changed so much, but it sort of felt like home in a strange way. TAGLE: Oh, lovely. What do you love about LA? DUHIGG: Ah, you know, the thing I love about LA is it's like 20 different cities in one, right? There's - and so many parts of the cities are so different from each other. There's Koreatown, and there's Chinatown, and there's downtown. There's all these different parts of LA, and as you move through them, you get to experience those cultures in a way that even in a place like New York, it's hard to do. It's just - it's a really dynamic city. And you pick up so much energy just from being on the streets and talking to people. TAGLE: Totally agree. Totally agree. I'm actually - I'm from LA, and I've been... DUHIGG: Oh, are you? TAGLE: Yeah, I am. I'm from LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, and then I went to UCLA and hung out in Westwood for a little while. And every place I've lived in LA has felt like a substantially different place than the LA that I was at previously. DUHIGG: And it's fun, right? It's like you get to go around the world by driving, you know, three miles. It's amazing. TAGLE: Absolutely. I mean, when the three miles takes 45 minutes, I feel a little bit less enthused at times... DUHIGG: Right. That's true. That's true. TAGLE: ...But you're right. DUHIGG: ...That's true. Well, and what I love about what you just did is that you looped me. You - rather than me - waiting for me to ask you, where did you grow up? You built on what I was saying, to say, oh, I actually know LA. I grew up in LA. I can share with you things about LA. We can share this together. And that means, A, I know that you were listening to me, but, B, it means that in addition to sharing who I am, I get to learn something about you, which is that you also like that energy and you love - you like being in Los Angeles, but that, much like me and probably most people, the traffic is not ideal - right (laughter)? - that you probably value your time more than more than just being in a place that's exciting. And so only took us three questions, but I feel like we know each other. TAGLE: I agree. I feel like we did OK, Charles. Thank you. I was nervous about that. DUHIGG: (Laughter). TAGLE: Thank you. Thank you for the positive feedback. See how easy that was? Just listening and responding as yourself can help you really connect. So takeaway four - be authentic. DUHIGG: One of the things that we know about supercommunicators is that they have a couple characteristics - people who are consistently supercommunicators. They tend to ask 10 to 20 times as many questions as everyone else. But the questions are kind of throwaway questions. A lot of them are, like, you know, what do you think about that, or what happened next? So that we don't even hardly register them as questions. They tend to laugh more because they want to show us that they want to connect. But most importantly, they are authentic. So if you say something that indicates that you're struggling with something, they authentically listen to you and they might share something about themselves, or they might ask you a question about that. But they don't try and force something that's false. They don't try and imply that that they're curious, but the reason that they're asking what happened is because they really want to talk about what happened to them. And so the more that we can be authentic with each other, the more that we can listen to what we're feeling and thinking, the more paradoxically we get better listening and in speaking in ways that other people want to listen to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, supercommunicators, let's recap. Takeaway one - communication is about connection, and a learning conversation is a great way to get on the same wavelength with someone. Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone - practical, emotional, social - then match accordingly. Takeaway three - ask lots of questions. Remember, supercommunicators tend to ask 10 to 20 more questions than everyone else, and deep questions will build connection quickly. If nothing comes to mind right away, start with why. Takeaway four - be authentic. You don't have to be an extrovert or comedian to really connect with people. Just lead with your curiosity and don't be scared to be vulnerable. Remember, being a supercommunicator isn't just for the elite few. DUHIGG: Any of us can become a supercommunicator. The reason I wrote the book is because it's just a set of skills that anyone can learn, and when we learn them and when we use them, we begin connecting with other people in this profound way that makes our life so much more meaningful and ultimately makes us healthier and happier and more successful.

His latest effort is a six-part series called  The American Revolution. By focusing on the Revolutionary War ,  Burns is revisiting some very familiar territory. His long and impressive filmography includes a history of Congress, and biographies of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. He's done deep dives into American military conflicts, including  World War II  and the  Vietnam War . Throughout his career, Burns has developed and perfected the tricks of his particular trade: the evocative use of music and quotations from speeches and correspondence; the use of actors to read the words of historical participants; the zooming in and out to reveal key details in period photos; and the painstaking attention to sound effects, from birds to bullets, to help bring those images to life. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       All of that knowledge, and all of those gimmicks, are utilized in  The American Revolution , an exceptional work about the founding of our country. It's written by Geoffrey C. Ward, who wrote  The Civil War  and many other Burns documentaries, including the ones on Congress and Thomas Jefferson. And it's co-directed by Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, both of whom have worked with Burns for years. But  The American Revolution  presents a challenge that even  The Civil War  did not. No photographs, period. To compensate, Burns and company use war re-enactors and place them in the actual historical locations.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On many — let's say most — documentaries using a similar technique, the effect can be cheesy. But in  The American Revolution,  the directors avoid showing the faces of the actors re-enacting battle movements. Instead, parts of their bodies are shown in intense close-up: a bandaged hand here, a muddy boot there. Elsewhere, in an approach that borders on pure art, the directors use drones to capture the action from high, high above. It's unusual — and beautiful. Battles are the surprisingly dominant ingredient of this series.  The American Revolution  goes into more detail about individual battles than I ever learned in my own American history classes — but new and vintage maps, animated to show troop positions and movements, make it all very clear, and very vibrant. The actors quoting from the historical participants, and the historians interviewed to comment on the action, do the rest. Peter Coyote, the actor who has narrated many Burns documentaries, does so again here. He's got a great voice for it, and leans into all the difficult place names, and people's names, with confident authority.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In their various war documentaries, Burns and his team always have focused as much on the ground troops as on the generals — often much more so, telling their story from the bottom up, rather than the top down.  The American Revolution  does both: We hear important observations from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, but also from Native Americans, revolutionary women, enslaved people and others not always given voice in such narratives.  In addition, the program's historians make us think differently about the history we're witnessing. In the colonies, those who were faithful to the crown were called Loyalists, and those against them called themselves Patriots. This series humanizes both sides, and also explains why some Native tribes, including the Shawnees, sided with the British in hopes of protecting their own lands.  The sheer number of the battles, and the details about them, attest to how hard our ancestors fought for the notion of a Federalist society. At the end,  The American Revolution  reminds us that the quest to maintain that society, and to strive to achieve a more perfect union, is far from over.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97665","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:38:00-05:00","title":"California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that license expiration dates exceeded the legal status end dates, following criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

November 13, 2025 • 4:38 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday. The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns. \"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\" Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV. Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement. \"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns. Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply. The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days. Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued.

Some Israelis question the practice \n         By Shir David, Alon Avital \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         TEL AVIV, Israel — In exchange for Hamas freeing its final group of Israeli hostages, Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinians from prison in October. Most of the Palestinians released by Israel had been arrested in Gaza on suspicion of taking part in hostilities during the war and held without charge, and they were sent back to the territory. But 250 of them were serving long sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. For 154 of those prisoners, their freedom came with a major condition: They were sent into exile, never to return to their homes in the Palestinian territories. They were sent to Cairo, with their final destination still undetermined. Israeli security experts say the deportation policy is intended to prevent released prisoners from returning to militant activity and posing a future threat to Israelis. But past cases suggest the policy of deporting Palestinian prisoners abroad can have unintended, long-term consequences for Israeli security. Hamas leaders behind the Oct. 7 attack were released prisoners Two prisoners released by Israel in a 2011 prisoner-hostage swap with Hamas ended up taking leadership roles with the militant group after being released, according to Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency. Zaher Jabarin, deported to Turkey, began overseeing Hamas' financial operations, the Shin Bet said  in a report . Another,  Yahya Sinwar , became the Hamas leader in Gaza who orchestrated the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel — when 1,144 Israelis were killed, according to Israeli government figures, sparking the Gaza war. Another notable case is Saleh al-Arouri, a founding commander of Hamas' military wing. He was released from Israeli prison and deported in 2010. Settling first in Syria and later moving between Turkey, Lebanon and Qatar, he is widely credited with building Hamas' West Bank militant networks and helping plan the Oct. 7 attack. A mastermind of Hamas' hostage-taking strategy is now free Among the prisoners released in October and deported are those responsible for some of the most notorious attacks against Israelis in recent decades. One is Mahmoud Issa, who founded a Hamas unit decades ago that was responsible for abducting Israeli soldiers to use them as bargaining chips for pushing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. He was arrested in 1993 and sentenced to life imprisonment, convicted for abducting and killing an Israeli police officer. Another is Imad Qawasmeh, a Hamas operative sent abroad in the recent deal, who was incarcerated for more than 20 years in connection with a pair of suicide bombings that killed 16 Israelis in the southern city of Beersheba in 2004. The Israeli debate about deporting Palestinian prisoners Some Israeli security analysts say deporting high-risk prisoners abroad is better than allowing them to return to their families and communities in the Palestinian territories. They argue that the distance reduces the released prisoners' ability to resume operational roles in militant groups like Hamas. Deportation can also decrease the influence they have on Palestinian communities in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, where they could otherwise inspire further violence toward Israel, said Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert in Palestinian affairs at Tel Aviv University and former Israeli military intelligence officer. \"It can be better than having them here, mainly when it comes to those who are very experienced, admired and will contribute significantly to the terror infrastructure,\" said Kobi Michaeli, an Israeli security expert with the Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute think tanks. The effect of deportation, from a Palestinian perspective Palestinian human rights advocates criticize the deportations, which prisoners agreed to under conditions of imprisonment, as forcible displacement. Israeli analysts defend the practice, saying prisoners were offered a choice to remain incarcerated or be freed and deported. The majority of Palestinian prisoners' close relatives were barred by Israeli authorities from traveling abroad to greet their deported relatives after the most recent prisoner release, according to Qadura Fares, a veteran Palestinian prisoner advocate and the former head of prisoner affairs for the Palestinian Authority. Fares says the families were told the restriction was for security reasons. Fares himself was imprisoned in Israel in 1981, charged with being part of a militant squad that obtained weapons and conducted attacks, and was released to the West Bank in 1994 as part of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. \"Every prisoner dreams of being free in his own environment, in his town or village, among his family and friends, where people know him and where he has personal and social status,\" Fares told NPR. \"Israel thinks that it can distance these people from their homeland in order to stop them from influencing their societies, but it is a mistake. If a prisoner is released to a normal and familiar environment, he adapts and lives a normal life.\" But Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency suggests otherwise. A report by the Israeli parliament's research arm, The Knesset Research and Information Center, cites Shin Bet figures that  about 75%  of the Palestinian prisoners released in the 2011 prisoner-hostage deal returned to militant activity. The figures do not account for prisoners who are no longer alive. When asked whether deportation could serve as a form of punishment, Michaeli dismissed the idea: \"I think that for these people to live in Doha or in Istanbul under the hospitality of the [Qataris] and the Turks, is not a punishment.\" The Shin Bet declined NPR's request for comment on Israel's deportation policy. The impact of Israel's recent strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar If released prisoners end up in cities like Qatar's capital of Doha, or Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey, they could be in \"safe zones\" enabling released prisoners to operate more freely and play a future role in groups like Hamas, Michaeli explained. \"They have a sort of immunity, because Israel will not target them, at least not under the current circumstances,\" Michaeli said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Israel is widely believed to be  behind one assassination  of a Hamas figure in a Gulf state in the past, but its  strike in September on Hamas leaders  in Qatar angered the U.S. and \"was a lesson for Israel: You cannot really assassinate anyone in Hamas any place you want, because there is a price for moves like that,\" said Milshtein. Israel could pursue these individuals abroad at a later date, but the large-scale release of high-profile prisoners will place a heavy burden on Israel's intelligence agencies, requiring ongoing surveillance to prevent future attacks, writes Israeli analyst  Yoni Ben Menachem  of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a conservative Israeli think tank. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo told NPR that the 154 prisoners deported last month were initially put up in Renaissance Cairo Mirage City Hotel, a high-end Marriott hotel. But after the  Daily Mail  reported  on their location, dubbing it \"Hotel Hamas,\" they were transferred to another hotel along the Gulf of Suez in the city of Ain Sokhna, about an hour and a half outside of Cairo, the embassy said. Israel and Egypt have not commented on their ultimate destination. Nuha Musleh in Ramallah, West Bank, Ahmad Abuhamda in Cairo and Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535565","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00Z","title":"Why home insurance is unaffordable, even in places without wildfires or hurricanes","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explains that even in areas without hurricanes or wildfires, home insurance is becoming unaffordable due to increasingly frequent and severe hailstorms, especially in the central United States.

insurance is unaffordable, even in places without wildfires or hurricanes \n         By Rebecca Hersher \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 5:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The storm blew into Cozad, Neb., in the wee hours of Saturday, June 29, 2024. The wind felt like a hurricane. The hail was the size of softballs. \"I was in the window, I was crying,\" remembers Soledad Avalos, who has lived with her husband in their home in Cozad for 35 years. \"Seeing all the damage [to] the cars and the house.\" When the sun came up, the extent of the damage became clear. Cozad is a small town of about 4,000 people, surrounded by corn fields. Crops were flattened. Virtually every vehicle parked outside that night had a broken windshield. Nearly every roof in town was leaking, or worse. Siding was missing, paint had been stripped away. The storm came from the northwest, and so nearly every northwest-facing window was cracked. Both the hospital and the school were in disrepair. \"Those softball-sized hail stones just punched a hole through the roof membrane, and water was just pouring through the ceiling like a waterfall, or a shower,\" says Robert Dyer, the CEO of the Cozad Community Health System, which runs Cozad Community Hospital, the only hospital in town. \"Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating.\" The hospital's emergency department had to shut down for several hours, and the building is still being repaired more than a year later. Hailstorms like the one that hit Cozad don't often make national headlines, because they are usually hyper-local events that hit just one town, or one neighborhood in a larger city. Most hailstorms don't cause enough damage to trigger federal disaster declarations, or make it onto official annual lists of major weather disasters. And they are generally less deadly than flash floods, hurricanes and wildfires. But extremely costly hailstorms are getting more likely in the United States, researchers warn. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a pool ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have  more frequent hail  as the planet warms up. That risk is driving up the cost of home insurance in the middle of the country, saddling average Americans with huge bills. Areas with the most hail risk are seeing some of the fastest growing home insurance prices in the U.S.,  according to  two landmark  federal reports  released in the last year. \"In the Midwest, you've seen a surprising increase in losses,\" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest property insurance trade group. \"It's particularly the hail, the wind. A lot of damage to roofs.\" That escalating damage is a reminder that, as climate change drives more extreme weather, geography is no longer a guarantee of protection from skyrocketing insurance rates. Home insurance costs are skyrocketing in the middle of the U.S. The central United States is home to the  worst hail risk  on the planet. \"North America is the hail continent,\" explains Scott St. George, a climate scientist and the head of weather and climate research at WTW, an international risk analysis company. And he says hail is different from other types of severe weather because it does a lot of property damage without causing many fatalities. \"It basically damages anything that's outside. And we've got a lot of stuff in the way,\" according to St. George. \"There are more houses insured, more expensive cars. Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors.\" That has led to enormous bills for property insurance companies. \"You've seen some really big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S.\" says St. George. Last summer's hailstorm in Cozad caused an estimated $100 million in property damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith – an enormous sum for a town of just 4,000 people. And, in 2024, hailstorms caused an  estimated $160 billion  in damage to homes nationwide, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. That figure doesn't even include storms that produced hail less than 2 inches in diameter, which can still cause widespread damage. With losses mounting, insurance companies have raised prices in recent years. Nationwide, the cost of insurance rose about 8% faster than inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a  major report  published by the Treasury Department in January.  The report found that the average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers in the Northern Plains paying about 20% more than the national average, and consumers in the Southern Plains paying more than 45% more. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance this year is nearly $6,400, according to  Bankrate . That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average. In September, the Treasury report was removed from the department's website by the Trump administration. The Treasury Department did not respond to questions from NPR about why it was removed. Hail risk is only one of many reasons that insurance is more expensive. The higher cost of labor, and of construction materials are also driving up insurance prices, says St. George. \"Insurance is very impacted by inflation,\" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. \"So if inflation suddenly spikes, then insurance losses go up.\" And the  cost of building materials  has increased even more than other goods in recent years, he points out. Insurance companies are bringing in profits. Small towns are struggling Rising prices for homeowners appear to be translating into profits for the industry. After losing more than $10 billion in 2023, the industry saw $26 billion in profits in 2024, according to credit agency AM Best. Insurers say that's largely due to the severity of disasters in a given year. \"It can be a dramatic swing because some years you have huge catastrophes,\" says Gordon. When insurers raise prices, they are simply passing along the enormous costs of rebuilding from major disasters, he says. But high prices are hitting many homeowners hard, particularly in places with historically low cost-of-living, like Nebraska. \"Insurance in our state really has skyrocketed the past several years,\" says Josh Tapio, an insurance broker at All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb. A few years ago, an average homeowner would pay about $1,500 per year to insure their $300,000 home, Tapio says. Now, it costs between $3,000 to $4,500, a two or even threefold increase. \"There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill and they see that it's double from what they paid last year,\" Tapio says. His office has never been busier, as people shop around for a policy they can afford. The high cost of insurance can make property ownership untenable. Before the storm, longtime Cozad resident Jennifer McKeone owned two rental houses in town. The hail caused extensive damage to both, and her insurance company refused to keep insuring them. \"I scrambled to find insurance, and the only insurance I could find was going to raise the rent to the point where I didn't think the people who lived in the houses could afford it,\" McKeone says. She ended up selling the homes, because neither she nor her tenants could afford the insurance costs. Seniors are hit particularly hard by rising insurance costs In the year and a half since the storm hit Cozad, most of the broken windows have been replaced, and most of the leaking roofs have been repaired. \"The town is doing well,\" says McKeone, who runs the Cozad Development Corporation, a local group that builds housing in town and works with businesses. But under the surface, McKeone says, many are still trying to finish repairs to their homes. Seniors have been hit particularly hard, she says. Many older residents live on a fixed income from a pension or social security payments, and can't afford drastically higher bills. Baltazar and Soledad Avalos, whose home was severely damaged in the storm, have experienced insurance problems firsthand. The home that they've lived in for 35 years had an insurance policy, but that policy didn't cover the full cost of all the repairs to the roof, windows and siding. Baltazar is still out on a ladder most days, fixing damage at age 72. On top of that, the cost of their insurance has gone up by about 10%, which is significant for a retirement-age couple. Baltazar is retired, Soledad is still working. Insurance is more expensive, and it covers less One of the biggest complaints among Cozad residents is that, even as they shell out more for property insurance, that insurance is covering less. Many people in town now have policies with higher deductibles, meaning that they need to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before the insurance kicks in. And many new policies also don't cover the full cost of replacing a damaged roof, which is often the most expensive repair after a hailstorm. Megan Fales has worked as an insurance agent in Cozad for more than a decade, and handles hundreds of home insurance policies in town. \"A lot of people have just gotten to the point where, like 'Let's just take a higher deductible,'\" she says, because it costs less each month, even though they agree to pay more for repairs if there's a future storm. She says many homeowners in the area hope to save money by doing repairs themselves, instead of relying on insurance to pay. Businesses in town are also paying more money for less coverage. After the storm destroyed the roof of the local hospital, the insurance company refused to renew the policy. The only policies available are more expensive, and also have a much higher deductible for the roof. That means the hospital must pay more each month for insurance, and also must keep more cash on hand in case there's another storm. In an effort to avoid catastrophic damage in future storms, the hospital's governing board chose to upgrade the building. Instead of simply replacing the damaged roof, they are investing in roof materials that can withstand high winds and small hail. That choice saved them money on their monthly insurance premium, Dyer says. But even with those savings, they are paying more money for less coverage, compared to two years ago. \"It's to a point of unsustainability,\" says Dyer. \"If we got hit by another storm right now, it would drain all our cash.\" NPR's Robert Benincasa contributed to this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97616","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:53:00-05:00","title":"Israel's President Says 'Shocking' Settler Violence Against Palestinians Must End","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli President Isaac Herzog and top military officials condemned a wave of violent attacks by Jewish settlers in the West Bank, particularly targeting Palestinian villages like Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf, where settlers set fire to vehicles and property and clashed with soldiers.

• 4:53 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JERUSALEM — Israel's president and high-ranking military officials on Wednesday condemned attacks a day earlier by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, calling for an end to a growing wave of settler violence in the occupied territory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President Isaac Herzog described the attacks as \"shocking and serious,\" adding a rare and powerful voice to what has been muted criticism by top Israeli officials of the settler violence. Herzog's position, while largely ceremonial, is meant to serve as a moral compass and unifying force for the country. Herzog said the violence committed by a \"handful\" of perpetrators \"crosses a red line,\" adding in a social media post that \"all state authorities must act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       His remarks, and those of two high-ranking military officials, came after dozens of masked Israeli settlers attacked the Palestinian villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf in the West Bank on Tuesday, setting fire to vehicles and other property before clashing with Israeli soldiers. In other developments Wednesday: \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       — Israel reopened a crossing into the northern Gaza Strip that had been closed for two months. The move was welcomed by officials at the United Nations, who say Israel has been too slow in surging humanitarian aid to the territory since a ceasefire began last month. Aid has been delivered into Gaza since Oct. 10 through two crossings in southern and central Gaza. — The Israeli military said it killed four armed militants who posed an \"immediate threat\" in areas of southern Gaza under its control. In Khan Younis, one person was killed while approaching Israeli troops across the so-called yellow line. In Rafah, three people were killed while troops in the area were working to destroy underground tunnels. Military leaders react to settler violence in the West Bank The Israeli army's chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, echoed Herzog's condemnations of the West Bank violence, saying the military \"will not tolerate the phenomena of a minority of criminals who tarnish a law-abiding public.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said the army is committed to stopping violent acts committed by settlers, which he described as contrary to Israeli values and that \"divert the attention of our forces from fulfilling their mission.\" The chief of the military's Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, said responding to an \"anarchist fringe\" requires the use of significant resources that could otherwise be focused on bolstering security and conducting counterterrorism operations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The army said the settlers who attacked the villages fled to a nearby industrial zone and attacked soldiers responding to the violence, damaging a military vehicle. Police said four Israelis were arrested, while the military said four Palestinians were wounded. On Wednesday, police said three of the suspects were released and that one, a minor arrested on suspicion of arson and assault, will remain in custody for six more days, as ordered by a judge. Police said the actions of the three who were released are still under investigation \"with the goal of bringing offenders to justice, regardless of their background.\" Settler violence has surged Tuesday's violence in the West Bank was the latest in a series of attacks by young settlers that have surged since the war in Gaza erupted two years ago. The attacks have intensified in recent weeks as Palestinians harvest their olive trees in an annual ritual. The U.N. humanitarian office last week reported more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in October than in any other month since it began keeping track in 2006. There were over 260 attacks, the office said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Palestinians and human rights workers accuse the Israeli army and police of failing to halt attacks by settlers. Israel's government is dominated by far-right proponents of the settler movement including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who formulates settlement policy, and Cabinet minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the nation's police force. Muayyad Shaaban, who heads an office in the Palestinian Authority that is tracking the violence, said the settlers set fire to four dairy trucks, farmland, tin shacks and tents belonging to a Bedouin community. He said the attacks were part of a campaign to drive Palestinians from their land and accused Israel of giving the settlers protection and immunity. He called for sanctions against groups that \"sponsor and support the colonial settlement terrorism project.\" Palestinians react angrily In Beit Lid, residents said they don't want their lives ruled by fear of settler violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Mahmoud Edeis said the violence is undermining his family's right to live in safety. \"To feel that my children are safe, that when I go to sleep I can say, 'Okay, there's nothing (to worry about),'\" he said. \"But at any moment something could happen … This can't go on. It can't be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger.\" Amjad Amer Al-Juneidi, who works at a dairy factory that was attacked Tuesday, said the \"fully organized\" attack saw one person carrying gasoline-filled cans, another prying open the factory door with a crowbar and a third individual igniting the fuel. \"Their entry into the company wasn't random. It was organized, and they had a fully organized tactic for how to carry out the burning,\" Al-Juneidi said. UN officials say more aid is needed in Gaza \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While U.N. officials welcomed the Israeli decision to reopen the Zikim crossing into northern Gaza, they also reiterated criticism of Israel for not doing more. Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesperson, said Wednesday that humanitarian groups in Gaza are being hampered in their ability to distribute food once it arrives in the territory and having to \"stretch out the available stocks.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The demand for baby formula, for example, far exceeds the current supply, UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Pires said there are also concerns about whether there will be enough syringes to carry out a vaccination campaign that began this month and will continue into January. He said there could be supply problems starting next month if Israel doesn't allow greater shipments into Gaza. The Israeli agency in charge of humanitarian aid in Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement on Tuesday that \"Israel is fully committed to its obligation to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid trucks in accordance with the (ceasefire) agreement.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5442506","dateOfPublication":"2025-08-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"If compliments make you feel super awkward, this comic is for you","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the psychological impact of receiving compliments, drawing on research by social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao.

12, 2025 • 4:59 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         At the turn of the millennium, a new class of drugs derived from ancient Chinese herbal medicine revolutionized malaria care. Artemisinin's, as they're called, are based on extracts from the sweet wormwood plant. They arrived just as the drugs used since the 1970s were becoming useless for many, as the parasite that causes malaria evolved resistance. \"The deaths we saw in the late 1990s, the early 2000s — like 2 million a year — that was a direct result of drug failure,\" says  George Jagoe , executive vice president of access and product management at Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit. \"No one ever wants to be behind the 8-ball again.\" Artemisinins have saved millions of lives since then and are now the foundation of malaria treatment worldwide. But there are  worrying signs  that these drugs are following in the footsteps of their predecessors. To prevent history from repeating itself, new drugs that target the malaria parasite differently are required, says Jagoe. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I would call it being ready, having a fire extinguisher in the back that you're ready to use, but maybe not necessarily deploying, versus the house catches on fire and you've got nothing,\" says Jagoe. After more than two decades, researchers are on the cusp of having that fire extinguisher. A new drug, called GanLum, was more than 97% effective at treating malaria in clinical trials carried out across 12 African countries, researchers reported Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Toronto. That's as good, if not better, than the current standard of treatment. If approved by regulators, it could be a powerful new tool against a disease that kills roughly half a million people each year. \"It's a big deal,\" says  Kasturi Haldar , a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied malaria for decades and was not involved in this study. \"It's also pretty timely.\" That's because of artemisinin resistance. First discovered in southeast Asia in the late 2000s, it's recently spread to the continent hardest hit by malaria. \"Partial artemisinin resistance has been spreading quite aggressively across many parts of Africa,\" says  David Fidock , a microbiologist at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. \"We've been sounding the alarm that we must have new drugs to deploy, should resistance lead to treatment failure. [GanLum] will help stem that significantly.\" GanLum stands for ganaplacide/lumefantrine, a combination of two drugs, one new and one old (most antimalarial treatments are combinations of drugs, to target the parasite at different stages of infection). The new one, ganaplacide, was discovered by scientists at Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules   for antimalarial properties. It seems to work by disrupting the malaria parasites' ability to live inside human red blood cells. In the lab, the researchers showed it could kill all known forms of the parasite, including those with mutations linked to artemisinin resistance. It also attacks the stage of the parasite that's responsible for transmission. \"That is very desirable for a drug to have,\" says Haldar, since it can prevent the spread, in addition to just treating the patient. In clinical trial settings, the drug performed well too. The research team enrolled over 16,000 adults and children over 2 years old with malaria across a dozen countries in Africa. Half took GanLum over the course of three days and half got the current artemisinin-based standard of care. The team found both drugs were about equally effective, with GanLum coming out slightly on top. Both drugs had similar levels of side effects, including nausea and diarrhea. But the GanLum group did experience more vomiting. The drug still needs to clear additional regulatory hurdles before it gets to patients. The team thinks that'll take about a year and a half. Even if it's approved and rolled out, GanLum likely won't be fully replacing artemisinin-based treatments anytime soon, since arteminisin-based treatments still work in many areas. \"But at this point, it looks good enough that it could be used where there's a lack of responsiveness to the current [artemisinin-based] drugs,\" says Haldar.  Ultimately, that could prolong the lifespan of both drugs, and help countries avoid the kind of surge in deaths that's happened when resistance overwhelms existing tools. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5311920","dateOfPublication":"2025-04-05","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Want to raise bilingual kids?

First, let go of a common myth \n         By Julia Furlan \n        \n           Saturday, April 5, 2025 • 4:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When journalist  Conz Preti  brought her three children to visit family in Argentina in 2022, her four-year-old son did something surprising. \"He just started fluently speaking in Spanish with my family, with no hesitation, no mistakes,\" Preti says. In their house, she speaks to her children in Spanish and her husband speaks to them in English. But up until that point, her son   \"never, never talked to me in Spanish. Suddenly, it clicked,\" she says. Raising bilingual kids can feel like a challenge — especially on top of so many other things parents worry about.  But with \"consistency, exposure and practice, practice, practice,\" it's possible to successfully teach your child two or more languages, says  Liliana Diaz , a bilingual speech-language pathologist who is raising her two kids to speak Spanish and English. No expensive language lessons or language immersion school required. \"Children are like sponges absorbing everything they're seeing and hearing,\" says  Farwa Husain , a bilingual speech-language pathologist who is raising her three children to speak Hindi, Urdu and English. Whether you want your kids to learn your heritage language or the French you mastered in college, Diaz and Husain offer expert, parent-approved advice on how to cultivate a multilingual household. Let go of a common misconception  Some parents worry that teaching their child multiple languages will set them back or confuse them. But that's a myth, Husain says. According to a 2013 article in the journal  Learning Landscapes , kids who speak two languages are  not more likely  than kids who speak one language to \"have difficulties with language, to show delays in learning or to be diagnosed with a language disorder.\" The article also notes that \"code-mixing,\" or using two languages in the same sentence, is often  interpreted as confusion . It's actually a \"normal part of bilingual development,\" and even a sign of \"bilingual children's ingenuity,\" according to the researchers. In fact, being bilingual can come with several benefits. Studies have shown it can improve  cognitive function ,  help with multitasking  and boost  academic achievement . Pick a language strategy for your family  There are many effective ways to incorporate multiple languages with your kids at home. Pick an approach that works for your family, Diaz says. Our experts recommend a few techniques from the field of bilingual-speech language pathology. One parent, one language . Each caregiver speaks one language consistently with the child. For example, one parent speaks with the child in Mandarin and the other speaks in Hindi consistently at all times. Time and place . The family decides that, say, on Sundays, at breakfast or when they're at grandma's house, they will speak the minority language. Minority language at home . Everybody will speak the minority language at home, and then as the child goes to school, they're exposed to the majority language.  Mixed languages at home : Caregivers and kids all speak all languages simultaneously at home. It may sound confusing, but it works well in practice, Husain says. \"Children are able to decipher very quickly what each language is.\" Whichever technique you decide on, stick with it, say our experts. \"That's what it takes to learn a language,\" Diaz says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Create an immersive language environment at home There are many small, constructive ways to incorporate multiple languages into your day-to-day life. The exposure can add up, according to our experts. Here are a few ideas: Do the activities you're already doing with your kids in the second language.  \"Whether that's listening to music in the car, watching cartoons on TV, going on playdates or  reading,\" Diaz says. Aim for \"consistency, not perfection.\" Video-call relatives.  \"Being able to FaceTime a grandparent, sibling or cousin and have that back and forth with them in another language is so important,\" Husain says. \"You're building those same skills as if you're doing it in person.\"  Celebrate cultural events.  Providing children with the cultural context around their second language can make language learning more fun. Diaz makes a point to celebrate Día de Los Muertos with her two children so they have a connection to their Mexican heritage. \"Language is culture, which is identity,\" Foster curiosity.  Preti says she and her husband, who is fluent in French, \"always play and experiment with language with the kids. The other day, they wanted to know how to say some words in French, and were starting to pick up the similarities between Spanish and French.\"  Embrace imperfection  There will be times when your child just wants to speak the dominant language or mix their dominant and non-dominant languages together, and that's OK, our experts say. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Don't force it, Diaz says. \"If you want them to speak in a particular language at the moment,\" acknowledge what the child is saying first \"then model and respond in that language.\" If your child is code-mixing, don't try to correct them, Husain says. Instead, use it as an opportunity to engage.  Diaz says she loves when her son tries \"to carry one language over to the other. Sometimes he'll say these mixed English-Spanish words, and I'm like, 'Oh, that's a good one. I never thought of saying it that way.'\"  And have some patience. Preti says sometimes her kids will tell her they don't understand her when she's speaking to them in Spanish. \"I'm like, 'But you understand what I'm saying right now?' And they're like, 'Yeah.' And I'm like, 'Well, this is Spanish.'\"  Eventually, your child will get it, even if they don't realize it.  This episode was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

Instead of immediately seeking out extra-cushioned footwear or super-specialized shoe inserts, start with some foot exercises, says  Irene Davis , a professor of physical therapy and rehab sciences at the University of South Florida. \"People have these amazing muscles in their feet,\" Davis says. \"They actually have the ability to increase the strength and capacity of their feet, which can help with the pain.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In fact, regularly exercising your feet and ankles has been shown to reduce the risk of injury, prevent and alleviate pain and improve overall foot health, says  Dr. Adam Tenforde , an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.  Foot care experts share six exercises to try at home. Whether you're gearing up for that big soccer game, recuperating from a long day at work or just want the strongest feet possible to avoid trips and falls in the future, give them all a try or start with just one. Consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions, experience pain or have preexisting foot conditions like bunions, plantar fasciitis or achilles tendonitis. Exercise 1: Foot doming This exercise is like doing crunches for your feet. It targets your \"foot core,\" the muscles that work together to stabilize the foot for dynamic movement, Davis says. In the same way core exercises like planks or mountain climbers are important for total body movement, strengthening your foot core provides stability so the larger muscles that move the foot and ankle can do their job and protect against pain and injury, Davis says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       How to do it:  Start in a seated position, Tenforde says. Ground both the heels and the toes while pulling back the ball of the foot to raise your arch. Once raised, squeeze the arch muscles for a few seconds. Hold for two to three seconds for 10 repetitions to start. Once you've got the hang of it, try the same exercise standing, then slowly move up to 20- to 30-second holds for three to five repetitions to build endurance, Tenforde says. Foot doming can be practiced daily. Incorporate it into everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or waiting in line at the grocery store, he says. Exercise 2: Wall stretches This exercise can be effective for pain relief and increasing blood flow to your feet, says podiatrist  Ebonie Vincent . It's especially helpful if you suffer from plantar fasciitis. How to do it:  Stand up facing a wall. Then, wedge the toes of one foot against the wall, with the foot at about a 45-degree angle, keeping the heel on the ground. Place your hands on the wall for support if needed. Slowly begin to bend the knee of that elevated foot and bring your body forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your calf and the bottom of your foot. Vincent suggests holding the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeating three times on each side, up to three times a day. Exercise 3: Toe spreads Did you know you have the ability to spread out your toes as wide as you can spread out your fingers? If that idea seems wild, it's probably because for many people the range of motion in the toes has been limited by a lifetime of toe-constraining footwear, Davis says. The lateral stretching of toe spread exercises can help improve your flexibility and motor control, protect against bunion pain and increase foot stability, Tenforde says. How to do it:  Spread your toes as wide as possible and then bring them back to   a neutral position. To isolate the correct muscles, it's best not to flex or extend your toes as you go, Davis says. If you find that tough, try using toe separators, the kind you might use while getting a pedicure. Simply squeeze your toes against them for a few seconds, then stretch as far outside of them as you can for another few seconds. Try two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions   daily. Don't be discouraged if you have limited mobility at first, says Tenforde. Over time, your muscles should get stronger and you should be able to stretch wider. Exercise 4: Toe Yoga  Don't worry, no miniature yoga mat required here. But like other yoga practices, toe yoga — or toe-ga, as Davis and Tenforde call it — can improve your balance and foot stability by strengthening a number of your toe muscles. Strong toes are important for the \"push-off\" function needed to walk or run, among other things, Davis says. How to do it:  Stand with your feet on the floor and lift up your big toe while keeping your lesser toes on the ground. Then, raise your lesser toes while keeping your big toe on the ground. Do two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions daily, Tenforde says. Exercise 5: Calf raises  Yep, they're not just for rounding out leg day at the gym. Since they mimic the propulsive phase of walking or running, Tenforde says calf raises are great for strengthening the stabilizing muscles and ligaments of the foot and ankle. But take care: while it might look easy, this exercise is often done wrong, he says. How to do it:  To get the most out of a calf raise, slowly rise up onto the front of your foot by activating your arch and lifting your heel as high as is comfortable. Then, use those same muscles of your arch and big toe to slowly lower the heel back down to the ground. It's common to roll to the lesser toes and the outside of the foot on your way down, but that works the wrong muscles and can lead to injury, Tenforde says. Once you've got the right mechanics down, aim for two to three sets of 10-15 reps every other day. Start with double leg calf raises and then move to single leg if you're up for a challenge, Tenforde says. Exercise 6: Hold hands with your feet This one is more of a stretch to warm up or cool down — and will make your feet feel happy, says orthopedic surgeon  Dr. Erica Rowe Urquhart . How to do it:  Sit in a comfortable seated position. Interlace the fingers of one hand with the toes of the opposite foot and gently massage the bottom of your feet with the thumb of your free hand. Then, gently rotate the foot and ankle to help loosen any tension in the foot and lubricate your joints, she says. By spending just a few minutes holding hands with each foot at the beginning and end of each day, you can prepare your feet for all the work they'll be doing — and then thank them for all the weight they carried throughout the day. And we could all stand to show our feet a little more care and gratitude, Urquhart says. This story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

Tuesday's activity was the result of a phenomenon called  coronal mass ejections  (CMEs), massive blasts of plasma and magnetic field from the sun's outer atmosphere that grow in size as they hurtle towards Earth. Two CMEs arrived on Earth on Tuesday, Dahl said. The resulting storm  reached G4 levels , the second-highest on NOAA's five-step scale, and created a magnetic field that was \"not only eight times stronger than what's normal but … also favorable for continued activity,\" Dahl said in a  later update . Forecasters are awaiting a third and final CME, which they expect will arrive on Earth at  midday Wednesday  and be even stronger than the previous two. \"That was the most energetic and strongest of this activity out there in space,\" Dahl said. \"It was traveling significantly faster than these other two, and we think that's going to pack even a stronger punch than what we've already experienced.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  Space Weather Prediction Center says  the aurora may become visible \"over much of the northern half of the country, and maybe as far south as Alabama to northern California.\" The  Met Office , the U.K.'s national weather service, says the aurora may also be visible over parts of Britain on Wednesday night, though it is likely to be obscured by cloud cover — as was the  case in Michigan  on Tuesday. Luckily, Americans in northern states won't have to wait long for another chance to get a glimpse. How to see (and photograph!) the northern lights  A dark setting is essential to see the aurora, so it's important to get away from light pollution if you want a good glimpse of the northern lights. It'll be easiest to see between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time, according to NOAA. It is difficult to predict the exact timing and location of the northern lights, but you can sign up for different services that alert you when an aurora may be visible in your area. For example, a citizen science platform called  Aurorasaurus  allows users to report when and where they see an aurora, and gives estimates on how visible an aurora is in a given area. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Another option is an app called My Aurora Forecast & Alerts, available for download on both iOS and Android devices. This is a location-based app that gives viewing probability and forecasts. Smartphone cameras are better at capturing the full array of an aurora than our naked eye, so be sure to go out with your phone to view a fuller spectrum of colors. If your phone camera has a night mode option, it's best to switch it on when photographing the northern lights. You can also switch your phone camera to manual mode and adjust the exposure settings to get the perfect picture. Why we are seeing more northern lights  Auroras have been happening more frequently in the United States for a while, and will continue to do so for several months. This influx of shimmering colors comes because the sun is reaching the peak of its 11-year cycle and, therefore, its solar maximum. The solar maximum causes solar eruptions, and this increase of activity brings ions, or electrically charged particles, closer to Earth. This stream of particles is known as the solar wind. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As solar winds get closer to Earth, the charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere. When they collide, light is emitted. The light emits at various wavelengths, creating a colorful display throughout the night sky. When the sun is at its solar maximum, the number of solar eruptions increases, which is why there are more auroras in the sky. Usually, this activity only takes place near the Arctic Circle, but since solar activity is strong right now, viewing areas have expanded to other regions, like the Midwest. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599908","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Why More Than 1,000 Musicians Are Boycotting Israel With 'No Music for Genocide'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 1,000 musicians and labels, including Lorde, Björk, and Massive Attack, have joined the 'No Music for Genocide' boycott, geo-blocking their music from Israel in response to a United Nations report concluding that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.

are boycotting Israel with 'No Music for Genocide' \n         By Isabella Gomez Sarmiento \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Since September, more than 1,000 artists and labels including  Lorde ,  Björk  and  Massive Attack  have joined an international initiative to remove their music from Israel. The boycott, called No Music for Genocide, is straightforward: artists are asking their labels and distributors to geo-block their music so it cannot be streamed in Israel. According to the movement's  website , this act is \"just one step toward honoring Palestinian demands to isolate and delegitimize Israel.\" Despite a  fragile ceasefire  currently in place, No Music for Genocide organizers say they're continuing the boycott amidst  additional airstrikes  in Gaza. \"Boycott is one of the most effective and enduring efforts that one can take to fight a militarized, overtly violent, three-headed monster of a system,\" blues poet  Aja Monet , one of the participants, tells NPR. \"We're in a place where capitalism rules everything. The most effective thing we can do is to be strategic about where we put our resources.\" The musicians' coalition coincides with a  similar pledge  from some  Hollywood stars  to boycott Israel's state-funded film industry. In September, an independent United Nations commission of inquiry  concluded  that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and that countries helping to arm the Israeli government, like the United States, are complicit in the violence. Israel strongly denies that it is committing genocide — and some Israelis say the artists' efforts are misguided, because the boycott affects even those who oppose the war. In a statement to NPR, the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. condemned the musician-led protest. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The attempt to boycott Israeli culture under the banner of 'No Music for Genocide' is discriminatory, immoral and misguided,\" reads the statement. \"Such boycotts do nothing to advance peace or improve the lives of either Israelis or Palestinians. On the contrary, they deepen division and harm the very people they claim to support.\" Although the State Department also rejected the U.N. report, some American musicians are demanding action and accountability over the U.S. government's role in the attacks. \"As a U.S citizen, I have a connection to this genocide that is happening using my tax dollars. As a musician, I am sensitive — I think that is necessary for making art,\" composer and singer-songwriter  Julia Holter , another participant in the campaign, said in a statement shared with NPR. \"Every day for over a year and a half now, we have seen horror stories abound in Gaza, and every malnourished baby I see with horrific injuries, every mother or father I see hovered over their child targeted by a sniper makes me think of my child, makes me think of anyone I have ever loved. I feel a responsibility to do something, however small it may be.\" Historic precedents  The No Music for Genocide movement, which is a decentralized volunteer network of musicians and labels, cites the success of cultural boycotts against South Africa during apartheid as a major inspiration. While artists like  Hugh Masekela  and  Miriam Makeba  made music a core tenet of anti-apartheid activism, international artists also played an important role. In 1985, E Street Band guitarist  Steven Van Zandt  led dozens of musicians, including  Bruce Springsteen ,  Miles Davis  and  Rubén Blades , in the  Artists United Against Apartheid  effort to record \"Sun City.\" The hit single referred to a luxury whites-only resort where artists including  Queen  and  Linda Ronstadt  had performed; the song's lyrics criticized their actions and pledged to avoid playing there until the end of apartheid. In 2023, artists ranging from Pedro Pascal to Quinto Brunson called for a  ceasefire  amidst the conflict in Gaza, but No Music for Genocide is a musician-led boycott. In a statement shared with NPR, vocalist, guitarist and boycott participant Marisa Dabice of the band  Mannequin Pussy  said mainstream artists could make a real difference. \"Without the participation of major label artists, this boycott cannot grow in the way it needs to make the largest possible impact,\" she wrote. \"We live in a day and age where unified direct action can make an impact —- we just have to be focused and unrelenting.\" The No Music for Genocide website notes that all three major U.S. labels — Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group —  ceased   operations  in Russia shortly after the invasion of Ukraine and pledged to support humanitarian relief efforts. The group argues the same should be done on behalf of Palestinians. Yasir Razak of the shoegaze band Nabeel, one of the artists geo-blocking his music from Israel, says he sees a link between the war in Gaza and the way Western powers have historically intervened in the Middle East. Razak was born in Baghdad around the time of the first Gulf War and grew up in the U.S. during the Iraq War. Although the Iraq War and the current conflict are markedly different, he says, they're not entirely separate. \"What makes me most sad is the idea that folks in other countries can't be seen,\" he says, adding that this is often the case with people from the Middle East. \"We've gone to great lengths to dehumanize them to the point where we can carry out these kinds of attacks against the majority popular opinion.\" In September, a  New York Times  and Siena University  poll   found  that a majority of American voters oppose continued U.S. economic and military support for Israel in the war, a reversal from public opinion shortly after the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7 in 2023, which killed 1,200 people according to the Israeli government. In July, a Gallup poll  found  that 60% of Americans disapprove of Israel's military actions in Gaza which have killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Razak says he has mostly received positive feedback from his fans for participating in the boycott. One downside, he notes, is that some digital service providers include Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories in the geo-block as part of Israel. After hearing directly from an affected listener, Razak found a workaround to provide free downloads of his music on the music distribution platform Bandcamp. But he says beyond the logistics of where the music is or isn't accessible, there is an underlying anxiety that comes with publicly voicing his stance against the Israeli state. (Several artists NPR reached out to declined to comment on the boycott). \"Ultimately, this is a humanitarian issue. We've all been seeing videos coming out of Gaza. We've heard members of the Israeli government speaking about what their intentions are. I think any right-minded person would look at that and say this is something to take a stand against,\" Razak says. \"But the attempt to conflate that in any way with hatred or antisemitism has been so dangerous and paralyzing, and fear-inducing for those of us who really feel like there's a moral obligation for us to stand against.\" Backlash against musicians In April, Cornell University dropped R&B singer  Kehlani  as the headliner of a campus concert. In a  statement , University President Michael I. Kotlikoff wrote that Kehlani \"espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media.\" Kehlani has been an outspoken advocate for Palestinians; the  video  for their 2024 song \"Next 2 U\" features a quote from Palestinian-American poet Hala Alyan, along with the phrase \"Long Live the Intifada.\" (The Arabic word generally translates to \"uprising\" and has a  long history  within the context of the war in Gaza.) During their  performance  at NPR's Tiny Desk last year, Kehlani wore a  keffiyeh  — the traditional Arab headdress that's become a symbol for Palestinians — and stopped to address the audience. \"I want to take a second to say: Free Palestine. Free Congo. Free Sudan. Free Yemen. Free Hawaii. Free Guam,\" Kehlani said. \"It's deeper than this. I need everybody that's here right now, everybody that's watching, to step up, to use their voices.\" After Cornell's decision, New York nonprofit City Parks Foundation, which organizes the SummerStage concert series, also  cancelled  Kehlani's scheduled Pride performance following pressure from the mayor's office and citing \"security concerns.\" Brooklyn-based rapper  MIKE , who is participating in No Music for Genocide, curates an annual hip-hop festival in partnership with SummerStage. He tells NPR he cancelled this year's edition in solidarity with Kehlani. \"You have to sacrifice for a bigger purpose,\" he says. \"One of the things that I see people trying to do with hip-hop is further detach it from its political foundation, its anti-establishment foundation.\" MIKE says music played a key role in shaping his political awareness, and he hopes his involvement in the geo-block movement stirs something in listeners. He's already received messages from fans in Israel over the removal of his music; he says he hopes the boycott inspires deeper reflection on the oppression of Palestinians and all peoples. Impact on Israeli music fans But on the ground in Israel, the boycott has led to some confusion. Linda Dayan, a reporter for  Haaretz  based in Tel Aviv, says that while most participating artists' music has been pulled from SoundCloud, several discographies are still available on other streaming platforms like Spotify. Dayan says blocking the music is \"just a punishment\" for the many Israelis who have long-opposed the war in Gaza. \"I think if [artists] really do want to make an impact, they should be putting their money behind their morals when it comes to either donating to initiatives that ensure that Gazans can get the aid that they so badly need, and organizations — especially within Israel — who are doing this work on the ground, who are organizing these protests,\" Dayan says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She points to groups like  Standing Together , a grassroots organization of Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel working to promote peace and unity. Dayan says she worries that instead of bringing people together, the boycott could further alienate Israelis. \"There is a really big narrative among the Netanyahu government and among factions of the right: 'They don't hate you because of what we do, they hate you because of who you are,'\" Dayan says. \"These boycotts that target wide swathes of people without considering the work that they're personally doing with Palestinians, the work that they are doing against the government or toward a just peace is giving credence to that idea.\" For several participating artists, No Music for Genocide is not an end-all solution, but they say it's an important form of nonviolent action. Aja Monet says the boycott is only one part of a much larger collective resistance. \"Just as much as we're talking about what's happening in Palestine, we're talking about the rising state of fascism in this country,\" she says. \"We're talking about poverty. We're talking about the books that are being banned. We're talking about the immigrant community that's being attacked and kidnapped from their homes in their street corners. All of this is from the same arm of violence and threat and terror. All of those things concern us and we want an end to it.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:45:35+00:00","title":"U.S. Ends Penny Production After 230 Years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States officially ended production of the penny on November 12, 2025, marking the conclusion of a 230-year tradition.

(AP) — The U.S. ended production of the penny Wednesday, abandoning the 1-cent coins that were embedded in American culture for more than 230 years but became nearly worthless. When it was introduced in 1793 , a penny could buy a biscuit, a candle or a piece of candy. Now most of them are cast aside to sit in jars or junk drawers, and each one costs nearly 4 cents to make. “God bless America, and we’re going to save the taxpayers $56 million,” Treasurer Brandon Beach said at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia before hitting a button to strike the final penny. The coins were then carefully placed on a tray for journalists to see. The last few pennies were to be auctioned off.

Others pleaded with customers to bring exact change. The more creative among them gave out prizes, such as a free drink, in exchange for a pile of pennies. “We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,” Jeff Lenard of the National Association of Convenience Stores said last month. Proponents of eliminating the coin cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers and the fact that some countries have already eliminated their 1-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012. Some banks began rationing supplies, a somewhat paradoxical result of the effort to address what many see as a glut of the coins. Over the last century, about half the coins made at mints in Philadelphia and Denver have been pennies.

the military’s unlawful revocation of their early retirement pensions and benefits. The lawsuit, filed in federal court Monday, comes several months after the Air Force confirmed that it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. It is just the latest in a series of legal challenges to the Trump administration’s policies that have sought to push transgender troops out of the military since the early days of his second term. The U.S. Supreme Court in May, however, allowed the ban on trans troops to be enforced while legal challenges proceed. According to GLAD Law , one of the advocacy groups that helped bring the lawsuit, service members affected by the policy will now face a loss of up to $2 million owed for their service over the course of their lifetimes in addition to the loss of health insurance benefits. Michael Haley, a staff attorney with the group, said the revocation of the early retirement benefits was part of “the general cruelty in attacking transgender people.” He noted that many of the plaintiffs had received orders allowing their retirements and that some had even begun the process of getting out of the military.

He told The Associated Press that “the military taught me to lead and fight, not retreat.” “Stripping away my retirement sends the message that those values only apply on the battlefield, not when a service member needs them most,” he added. “These are folks who are going to move on with their lives, have received the OK to do so, and then have that taken away from them once again,” Haley said. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to comment but has a longstanding policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation. President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal. Pentagon officials say 4,240 troops have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which the military is using as an identifier of being transgender. The Air Force has been unique in implementing policies that have gone beyond just separating troops from military service. In addition to revoking retirement benefits, the service moved in August to deny transgender members of the Air Force the chance to argue before a board of their peers for the right to continue serving. The Pentagon rolled out a similar , military-wide version of that policy less than two weeks ago."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604384","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00.000Z","title":"3 Questions About Trump's 50-Year Mortgage Plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has proposed a federal government-backed 50-year mortgage plan to make homeownership more accessible, particularly for those struggling with high costs and rising home prices.

12, 2025 • 6:22 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Most people who take out mortgages go with a 30-year term. But President Trump wants the federal government to back a 50-year mortgage option for homebuyers — a plan that would be \"a complete game changer,\" according to Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Backers of the idea say it could help  more prospective buyers get into a home  they might not otherwise afford. But skepticism abounds, with Fox News' Laura Ingraham  telling Trump this week  that the proposal \"has enraged your MAGA friends.\" Ingraham cited \"significant MAGA backlash, calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.\" Trump said the criticism is overblown: \"All it means is you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.\" The proposal is being floated at a time when many are struggling to get a foothold in the housing market. The  pace of home sales has slowed , as potential buyers navigate two main obstacles: mortgage interest rates spiked in recent years, and home prices continue to rise in many areas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new plan would also expose borrowers to debt for 20 additional years compared to a 30-year mortgage. And because standard  repayment schedules  devote far more money to paying interest in the early years of a loan rather than paying down the principal, it would take home buyers even longer to build equity in their property. \"You're going to be paying almost all interest for the first 10 years. It's really akin to an interest-only loan at that point,\" says Chris Hendrix, senior vice president for the home loans unit of NBKC Bank in Kansas City. He adds, \"that's true for a 30-year loan too: for the first 10 years, you're paying mostly interest on that loan. But it would look even worse on a 50-year loan for sure.\" Many questions remain about the plan, which the Trump administration revealed over the weekend. How do the numbers look on a 50-year versus 30-year mortgage? Using a $400,000 home with a 6.25% interest rate and a 10% down payment as an example, Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner said via email, \"a 50-year loan would save at most about $250 per month compared to the 30-year loan.\" That would help buyers in the short term — but over decades, buyers would end up paying much more. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Total interest on the 50-year loan would amount to $816,396 compared to $438,156 on the 30-year loan, a difference of $378,240,\" he says. \"That's 86% more interest over the life of the loans.\" Berner cautions that his hypothetical example assumes the same interest rate for both loans. In reality, he says, the interest rate for a 50-year loan would be higher than one for 30 years, making the disparity even more pronounced. \"The longer the life of the loan, the more compensation the lender will demand.\" Why would a bank want to offer a 50-year mortgage, and why would a buyer want one? \"Buyers do benefit from spreading out the high cost of a home purchase over a longer period,\" Berner says, \"but lenders certainly benefit too by having a longer period to charge higher interest rates.\" Bruce Marks, the CEO of  the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America , a nonprofit that helps people get low-cost mortgages, is skeptical that home buyers will embrace the plan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It will have no legs because they've tried to do a 40-year term that has not taken off,\" he says, referring to 40-year mortgage modifications that have been offered in earlier attempts to  help struggling homeowners . The 50-year proposal \"is even worse,\" Marks says. \"It will go nowhere. Borrowers will not do it. They see through that. They will know that they will not generate any wealth.\" The potential timing of a 50-year mortgage is uncertain. \"There's a lot of legal analysis\" over the proposal, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett  said this week , as he implied the plan might require legislation. Under the  Dodd-Frank Act , mortgages longer than 30 years don't meet the criteria for qualified mortgages — meaning they're ineligible to get the backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and lenders would be hesitant to offer them. In response to criticisms of the plan, Hassett said homeowners also build equity when their properties appreciate in value. Noting that prices tend to increase, he added, \"I don't think that the absence of equity is a serious concern about this.\" Could other changes help ease the housing crunch? \"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner says. \"The administration would do better to reverse tariff-induced inflation, which is keeping the rates on existing mortgages high, and to encourage the  expansion of housing supply  by promoting homebuilding.\" Hendrix says he understands the White House's motivation: to address a housing crisis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The median homebuyer right now in the nation is 59 years old. It is the highest that it's ever been since we started tracking it since 1981. What else is staggering is the median age for a first-time homebuyer is 40 years old right now. You're looking at a generation that has not had the ability to get into a property, start building equity, start building wealth from a home.\" Lower interest rates could help, Hendrix says. But he adds that the government also has other tools, such as helping first-time homebuyers and encouraging housing construction. One change Marks would like to see is any move that might limit individual homebuyers from being outbid by large corporations that add homes as part of their investment portfolios. Another, he says, is any policy that might support buyers secure mortgages of 30 years or less. \"The 30-year term has always been the sweet spot in this country.

2025-11-12T04:50:30+00:00\n\nThe federal government is reopening, but there’s still uncertainty about when one of the most far-reaching impacts of the closure will be resolved and all 42 million Americans who receive SNAP food aid will have access to their full November benefits. President Donald Trump signed the reopening measure Wednesday. One provision calls for restarting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but it doesn’t resolve when the benefits will be loaded onto the debit cards beneficiaries use to buy groceries. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the program, said in an email Wednesday that funds could be available “upon the government reopening, within 24 hours for most states.” The department didn’t immediately answer questions about where it might take longer — or whether the 24-hour timeline applies to when money would be available to states or loaded onto debit cards used by beneficiaries. There has been a series of court battles over the fate of the largest government food program, which serves about 1 in 8 Americans. Here are things to know about how it could go. When SNAP funds become available could vary by state Seesawing court rulings and messages from the USDA have meant that beneficiaries in some states already have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments. States say it’s faster to provide full benefits than it is to do the calculations and computer programming required for partial amounts. At least 19 states plus the District of Columbia issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, an Associated Press tally found. Many of them managed to do it in a day or so, in the narrow window between the Nov. 6 court ruling that required the federal government to make full payments and one Nov. 7 by the U.S. Supreme Court that stopped it . Jessica Garon, a spokesperson for the American Public Human Services Association, said she anticipates most states will be able to issue full benefits within three days after they’re given the go-ahead, but that it might take a week for others. Experts say the states that have sent no November benefits already, such as South Carolina and West Virginia, will likely be the quickest. But there’s a complication. Sixteen states have loaded the EBT cards used in SNAP with partial benefits. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst with the advocacy group Share Our Strength said some of those states might run into technical hurdles to issue the remaining amount. Delays in benefits can be a problem for recipients Even if there’s some clarity that benefits are on the way, exactly when they arrive will matter to millions of Americans. About 42 million lower-income Americans receive SNAP benefits , on average about $190 monthly per person. Many say the benefits don’t and aren’t intended to cover the full cost of groceries in a regular month, even with careful budgeting. It’s worse when benefits are delayed. Doretha Washington, 41, of St. Louis, and her husband have themselves and six children to feed and not enough money to cover that cost. Her husband works servicing heating and cooling systems, but the family still needs SNAP to get by. They had received nothing in November, although Missouri said Tuesday that partial benefits would be issued. “Now it’s making things difficult because we can’t pay our bills in full and keep food in here,” Washington said this week. “I’m down to three days of food and trying to figure out what to do.” She has been rationing what they have. Other people have turned to food charities but are sometimes finding long lines and low supplies. Cutting off funds left state governments scrambling The USDA told states Oct. 24 that it would not fund the program for November if the shutdown continued. That left states scrambling. Most Democratic-led states sued to have the funding restored. Some Democratic and Republican-led states launched efforts to pay for SNAP benefits using state money, boost food banks and deploy the National Guard to help with food distribution. Another group of states used their money allotted for SNAP benefits only after a judge ordered the Trump administration to cover the full cost for the month. The legislation to reopen the government passed by the Senate on Monday calls for states to be reimbursed for spending their funds to run programs usually paid for by the federal government. It’s not immediately clear, though, which situations might qualify in the case of SNAP. In the meantime, the USDA told states Tuesday that it would reimburse them for paying out partial SNAP benefits under a system where recipients get up to 65% of their regular allocations — and even states that paid the full amount can receive partial reimbursements. It also said it would not reduce the amount on cards for recipients in states that paid full amounts. Democratic-led states that sued for benefits to be made available said in a filing Wednesday that the late-arriving information “illustrates the chaos and confusion occasioned by USDA’s multiple, conflicting guidance documents.” ___ Associated Press reporters Margery A.

2025-11-12T05:01:32+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The longest government shutdown in history has come to an end, with almost no one happy with the final result. Democrats didn’t get the health insurance provisions they demanded added to the spending deal. And Republicans, who control the levers of power in Washington, didn’t escape blame, according to polls and some state and local elections that went poorly for them. The fallout of the shutdown landed on millions of Americans, including federal workers who went without paychecks and airline passengers who had their trips delayed or canceled . An interruption in nutrition assistance programs contributed to long lines at food banks and added emotional distress going into the holiday season. The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills. President Donald Trump signed the legislation Wednesday, just hours after the House passed it. The Senate had passed it Monday. Here’s a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end: What led to the shutdown Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden’s big energy and health care bill, and it’s set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected. “Never have American families faced a situation where their health care costs are set to double — double in the blink of an eye,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. While Democrats called for negotiations on the matter, Republicans said a funding bill would need to be passed first. “Republicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail. Thune’s position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. “Open up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,” Schumer said then. Democratic leaders under pressure The first year of President Donald Trump’s second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration’s deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don’t align with the administration’s priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled. Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump’s efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump’s big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. The Democrats’ struggles to blunt the Trump administration’s priorities has prompted calls for the party’s congressional leadership to take a more forceful response. Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders. This time around, Schumer demanded that Republicans negotiate with Democrats to get their votes on a spending bill. The Senate rules, he noted, requires bipartisan support to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary to advance a spending bill. But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party’s left flank when he refused to go along. “The Senate Democrats are afraid that the radicals in their party will say that they caved,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at one of his many daily press conferences. The blame game The political stakes in the shutdown are huge, which is why leaders in both parties have held nearly daily press briefings to shape public opinion. Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say Trump and Republicans in Congress have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a “moderate” share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility. Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a “big factor, negative” for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP’s stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority. Damage of the shutdown The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown. Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped , and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks. “This dysfunction is damaging enough to our constituents and economy here at home, but it also sends a dangerous message to the watching world,” said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan. “It demonstrates to our allies that we are an unreliable partner, and it signals to our adversaries that we can’t work together to meet even the most fundamental responsibilities of Congress.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the federal government shutdown at https://apnews.com/hub/government-shutdown ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-illinois-immigration-ice-c24537965e31860fb07ba83e79de4f4b","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:00:28+00:00","title":"Chicago Community Organizes 'Buy Out' Rides to Protect Street Vendors Amid Immigration Crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to over 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, street vendors and small businesses in Latino neighborhoods have faced severe economic and emotional hardship due to fear of arrest.

tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item — every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need. Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city’s Latino neighborhoods have emptied out . Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home. But as fear spread , so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called “buy out” events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars. In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.

Follow on Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor’s cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them. “This is about food and joy and bike rides,” Rosales said. “But it’s also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.” Street vendors targeted in immigration crackdown It’s hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained. In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city’s streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors.

The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors. Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to “buy them out,” Orozco said. “It’s been emotional to see,” she said. “The vendors themselves didn’t realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.” Communities rally to support restaurants as customers dwindle As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September. So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.

She was used to seeing familiar faces on 18th Street — a woman selling candy with her baby strapped to her back, a paletero who smiled at her each afternoon. Then one week, they were gone. “It broke my heart,” Martinez said. “The streets felt empty. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.” She began raising money online and started “Operation Buyout,” approaching vendors one by one to purchase everything they had. The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500. “I just wanted her to have a day of rest, a day without fear,” Martinez said. Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago. Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they’re sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler. “There is a magic when I’m baking,” he said in Spanish. “I feel free. When I’m angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.” A baker in the historically Mexican-American Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen speaks during an interview at Vault Gallerie, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

For years, he’s sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop. But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels “sick with fear.” “I’m afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. “It would be horrible to leave her. … I can’t see myself without my children.” Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street. The man’s hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry. “Thank you so much,” he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest. “It’s beautiful.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-poll-approval-government-shutdown-apnorc-9daa3f130fedc9cf9b5acf3de31e93f4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:22:50+00:00","title":"Public Approval of Trump’s Government Management Drops Sharply Amid Shutdown, AP Poll Shows","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new AP-NORC poll reveals a sharp decline in public approval of President Donald Trump’s management of the federal government, dropping from 43% in March to 33% in November 2025.

the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since early in his second term, according to a new AP-NORC poll, with much of the rising discontent coming from fellow Republicans. The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Democrats’ recent victories in off-year elections but before Congress took major steps to try to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It shows that only 33% of U.S. adults approve of the way the Republican president is managing the government, down from 43% in an AP-NORC poll from March . That was driven in large part by a decline in approval among Republicans and independents. According to the survey, only about two-thirds of Republicans, 68%, said they approve of Trump’s government management, down from 81% in March. Independents’ approval dropped from 38% to 25%. The results highlight the risks posed by the shutdown, which Trump and his administration have tried to pin squarely on Democrats, even as U.S. adults have cast blame on both parties as the funding lapse has snarled air traffic, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and compromised food aid for some of the most vulnerable Americans. But it could also indicate broader discontent with Trump’s other dramatic — and polarizing — changes to the federal government in recent months, including gutting agencies and directing waves of mass layoffs . Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? Trump’s approval on government management erodes among Republicans Republicans have generally been steadfast in their support for the president, making their growing displeasure particularly notable. “I’m thoroughly disturbed by the government shutdown for 40-something days,” said Beverly Lucas, 78, a Republican and retired educator who lives in Ormond Beach, Florida, and compared Trump’s second term to “having a petulant child in the White House, with unmitigated power.” President Donald Trump waves after speaking to the media upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025, after returning from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. and en route to an NFL football game between the Washington Commanders and the Detroit Lions.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “When people are hungry, he had a party,” she said, referring to a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “I thought he seems callous.” The survey found an overwhelming majority of Democrats, 95%, continue to disapprove of Trump’s management of the federal government, compared with 89% in March. Trump’s overall approval holds steady Even with the decline in support for his management of the government, Trump’s overall approval rating has remained steady in the new poll. About one-third of U.S. adults, 36%, approve of his overall handling of the presidency, roughly in line with 37% in an October AP-NORC poll. Approval of his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy have also barely changed since last month. Health care emerged as a key issue in the shutdown debate as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend tax credits that expire Jan. 1. But Trump’s approval on the issue, which was already fairly low, has barely changed. About one-third, 34%, of Americans said they approved of Trump’s handling of health care in the November poll, compared with 31% in October. And many of his supporters are still behind him. Susan McDuffie, 74, a Republican who lives in Carson City, Nevada, and retired several years ago, said she has “great confidence in Trump” and thinks the country is on the right track. She blames Democrats for the shutdown and the suffering it’s caused. “I just don’t understand how the Democrats can care so little about the people,” she said, scoffing at the idea that Democrats were trying to use the shutdown to force Republicans to address soon-to-skyrocket health care costs. “I don’t have any patience for the Democrats and their lame excuses,” she said, arguing that people who are scared about SNAP benefits expiring and struggling to put food on the table are a more pressing issue. Plenty of blame to go around When it comes to the shutdown, there is still plenty of blame to go around. Recent polls have indicated that while Republicans may be taking slightly more heat, many think Democrats are at fault, too. “I truly do believe it’s everybody. Everybody is being stubborn,” said Nora Bailey, 33, a moderate who lives in the Batesville area in Arkansas and does not align with either party.

And she is worried about her disabled parents, who rely on SNAP food stamp benefits. Overall, she said she is mixed on Trump’s handling of the job and disapproves of his management of the federal government because she believes he has not gone far enough to tackle waste. “I don’t see enough being done yet to tell me we have downsized the federal government instead of having all these excess people,” she said. It’s possible that Trump’s approval on handling the federal government will rebound if the government reopens. But the showdown could have a more lasting impact on perceptions of the president, whose approval on the economy and immigration has eroded slightly since the spring. Lucas, the Florida Republican, said shutdowns in which civilians aren’t paid are the wrong way to address ideological disagreement. “Air traffic controllers? Really?

(AP) — A grandfather and his young granddaughter. An electrician with two young children. A woman standing in line at a scrap metal business. They were among the 14 people who died in the fiery crash of a UPS plane in Louisville last week. Their names were released Wednesday as Mayor Craig Greenberg lamented the lives that will “forever be unfinished.” “As we share the names of those who we‘ve lost, our city feels the full weight of this unimaginable tragedy,” Greenberg said at a news conference. “Behind every one of these names is a circle of family, friends, stories that will forever be unfinished.” Eight days after the plane plowed into the ground in a massive fireball, the local coroner’s office said it completed the grim tasks of recovering victims’ remains, identifying them and notifying their loved ones. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board remain at the crash site , Greenberg said. Victims included three pilots on board when the crash happened during takeoff at UPS Worldport, the company’s global aviation hub located at Muhammad Ali International Airport. They were Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.

Footage from eyewitnesses and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Authorities believe that all the victims have been located and identified, Greenberg said Wednesday. John Spray, 45, was killed at Grade A Auto Parts & Recycling when the plane crashed into the business. The mother of his child, Tifany Torok, said in a GoFundMe account for Spray’s daughter that he “was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” The family of Louisnes Fedon, 47, said “his death has created a sudden and immense void that goes far beyond emotional grief\"; a GoFundMe was set up by a friend of Fedon’s children. Like Spray, relatives say Fedon and his 3-year-old granddaughter, Kimberly Asa, were in the wrong place at the wrong time when the plane crashed to the ground just off the runway. Matthew Sweets, 37, was severely burned and died days later. He worked as an electrician and had two young children, Cohen and Rayne, according to his obituary. Another victim, Ella Petty Whorton, 31, was at the recycling business when the crash occurred. Her boyfriend, Eric Richardson, said they worked together collecting scrap metal to help make a living. They had been a couple for more than a year after being introduced by a mutual friend. “She was a great person,” Richardson said this week by phone. “Everybody loved her. I miss her so much.” Others killed in the crash were Angela Anderson, 45; Carlos Fernandez, 52; Trinadette Chavez, 37; Tony Crain, 65; John Loucks, 52; and Megan Washburn, 35. Officials haven’t publicly shared details about them, including where they were when the plane crashed. Greenberg credited the coroner’s office for “working tirelessly, under incredibly challenging conditions,” to recover the victims’ remains, identify them and notify the families. “I had a family member ask me yesterday, ‘how do you ever get used to this?’ And I said, ‘I don’t,” Jefferson County Coroner Jo-Ann Farmer. “If I get used to this and it doesn’t bother me anymore, I’m in the wrong profession.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-ai-shutdown-earnings-3a1dc2963b619775b59898217851cc78","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:26:15+00:00","title":"U.S. Stocks Hover Near Records Amid AI Stock Volatility and Fed Rate Cut Speculation","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. stock markets reached or approached record highs on Wednesday, driven by strong performance in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

The S&P 500 added 0.1% and neared its all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 327 points, or 0.7%, to set a record for the second straight day , while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Advanced Micro Devices was at the front of the market. It rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su said the chip company is expecting better than 35% of annual compounded revenue growth over the next three to five years. She credited “accelerating AI momentum.” Stocks benefiting from the artificial-intelligence frenzy have been shaky recently, as investors question whether how much more they can add to already spectacular gains. Their sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation . Their prices have shot so high , though, that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Nvidia came into the day with a 4.6% drop for the month so far, for example, after its stock price more than doubled in four of the last five years. The biggest player in AI chips swung between gains and losses throughout Wednesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 3.6% for one of the day’s larger losses in the S&P 500.

One way for stock prices to look less expensive is for companies to deliver big growth in profits. On Holdings jumped 18% after the Swiss shoe and apparel company reported a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It reported growth in sales from around the world, with the strongest coming from Asia. But even beating expectations may not be enough for some stocks. Circle Internet Group fell 12.2% even though it reported profit for the latest quarter that trounced analysts’ estimates. The issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies has seen its stock price fall since it got near $300 in June, just a few weeks after its initial price offering of $31. It’s now below $87. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.31 points to 6,850.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 326.86 to 48,254.82, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 61.84 to 23,406.46. Another way for stock prices to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying lower yields can encourage investors to pay higher prices for other kinds of investments. In the U.S. bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.06% from 4.13% late Monday after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Traders still see a nearly 2-in-3 chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. That’s despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a third cut for the year is far from a sure thing. Fed officials are worried about the potential of giving still-high inflation more fuel. The Fed has been in a difficult spot recently because the U.S. government has not been publishing its usual updates on the job market, inflation and other areas of the economy. That’s restricted its view of how things are going, though the nation’s longest-ever shutdown appears to be nearing an end . In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germany’s DAX returned 1.2%, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1% for two of the world’s bigger gains. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-corruption-scandal-6e33b63b8071f46140956d4d23ab00de","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:33:30+00:00","title":"Ukraine Corruption Scandal: Top Officials Under Scrutiny Over $100M Energy Sector Kickbacks Amid War","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major corruption scandal involving state-owned Energoatom has emerged in Ukraine, with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) uncovering a network known as 'Midas' that orchestrated kickbacks of 10%-15% from contractors, exploiting martial law regulations to block legal claims.

embezzlement and kickbacks scandal involving the state-owned nuclear power company has put top officials under scrutiny. It’s fast becoming one of the most significant government crises since Moscow’s full-scale invasion, with media reports implicating a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Responding to a public backlash, Zelenskyy called for the dismissal of his justice and energy ministers amid the investigation. They later submitted their resignations, the prime minister said. Anti-corruption watchdogs — the same agencies Zelenskyy sought to weaken earlier this year— revealed the findings of a 15-month investigation, including 1,000 hours of wiretaps, resulting in the detention of five people, and another seven linked to about $100 million in kickbacks in the energy sector. Ukrainian officials are scrambling for European funds to manage mounting energy shortages as Moscow targets critical infrastructure and natural gas production to try to sink public morale. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s outnumbered forces are retreating under relentless assaults in the nearly 4-year-old war.

Military procurement scandals led to the ouster of Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in 2023. But the timing of this one couldn’t be much worse. “Internally this scandal will be used to undermine unity and stability within the country. Externally, our enemies will use it as an argument to stop aid to Ukraine,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy’s party. “It looks really bad in the eyes of our European and American partners. While Russians destroy our power grid and people have to endure blackouts, someone at the top was stealing money during the war.” One lingering question is how high the corruption goes. What investigators found The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, known as NABU, refrained from identifying the suspects but said they included a businessman, a former adviser to the energy minister, an executive who oversaw physical protection at state energy company Energoatem, and others responsible for money laundering. It dubbed the scheme “Midas.” The agency also accused eight people of bribery, abuse of office and possession of disproportionate assets. The investigation, which NABU said conducted over 70 raids, was welcomed by Zelenskyy, who urged officials to cooperate with it. Energoatom says the inquiry didn’t disrupt its operations. NABU released excerpts of tapes in which the network, using code names and secretive language, discussed blackmail and pressuring Energoatom contractors to extract 10%-15% in kickbacks and bribes in exchange for them to do business without facing internal blocks. The network took advantage of a regulation enforced during martial law prohibiting contractors from claiming debts in court from companies providing essential services, such as Energoatom, which has annual revenues of about $4,7 billion. Four others worked to launder the money at a Kyiv office. The tapes, which have not been independently verified by The Associated Press, say about $1.2 million was given to a former deputy prime minister, whom the plotters called “Che Guevara,” after the revolutionary leader. Ministers resign Amid the scandal, Zelenskyy called for the ouster of Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, who also was a former energy minister, and current Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk. Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said they submitted their resignations. She also said the cabinet submitted proposals to apply sanctions against Timur Mindich, a close Zelenskyy associate, and businessman Alexander Tsukerman. “Among other things, this is a matter of trust,” Zelenskyy said in a video on his Telegram channel. That has raised questions about what the country’s highest officials knew of the scheme, especially with war powers concentrated in the president’s office. Zelenskyy tried to curtail Ukraine’s anti-corruption watchdogs last summer but reversed course after widespread protests. Months later, the watchdogs released their findings. A Zelenskyy partner In the tapes, Mindich, 46, a co-owner of Zelenskyy’s Kvartal 95 media production company, is believed to be speaking under the code name “Karlsson.” Under Zelenskyy, Mindich has gained clout and influence in multiple industries, including lucrative domestic drone production. NABU has investigated his alleged connection with Fire Point, a drone manufacturer that has risen to prominence by securing government contracts. NABU investigated the company over concerns it misled the government on weapons prices. “It looks like Zelensky distanced himself from Mindich long ago and when the scandal broke out, Zelensky didn’t start to cover Mindich,” Merezhko said. “But I don’t rule out that someone from his entourage might have succumbed to temptation to make a quick buck.” The AP gained access to the company’s factory in August. Its executives deny connections to Mindich. “The key issue here is that the company supposedly affiliated to Mindich is getting government contracts outside the competition, because of the personal relationship to the administration,” said Ukrainian investigative journalist Yurii Nikolov, who looked into the businessman’s dealings with Fire Point. After his suspension as justice minister, Halushchenko said in a Facebook post that he would defend himself in court. “I believe that being suspended for the duration of the investigation is a civilized and proper course of action,” he said. “I will defend myself in the legal domain and prove my position.” Halushchenko, who was energy minister from 2021 until July when he took over as justice minister, has not been formally charged. “The silver lining in this story is that we have effective and truly independent anti-corruption bodies which have shown concrete results,” Merezhko said. “As it turns out, no one is above the law and no one is immune.” Political analyst Oleh Saakian said the scheme involved “millions, tens of millions of dollars,” but he also cautioned that its full scale is not known. While not the largest corruption scandal in Ukraine’s history, he noted it took place during wartime and is connected to “key players” in the government. Discussions about delays fortifying energy sites In the tapes from NABU, two discussions involved delays to building defensive fortifications for energy sites and waiting for a more profitable alternative before shielding them from Russian attacks. The talk mentioned giving contracts to build defensive protections to a known company, and later to increase kickbacks up to 15%. An AP investigation this year revealed that despite over a year of warnings from Ukrainian officials about vulnerabilities near nuclear sites, the Energy Ministry failed to act quickly. Particularly at risk were unprotected switchyards outside the perimeter of Ukraine’s three active nuclear plants — vital for generating power. Lawmakers highlighted this failure in a resolution calling for the removal of Haluschenko as energy minister and criticized him for alleged corruption and poor oversight. Reactions in Europe Ukraine’s partners have poured money into its energy sector and are likely to look with consternation on the scandal. A spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the government is concerned by the reports of corruption, noting they involve “a sector that receives considerable support from Germany.” The spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, pointed to worries voiced in last week’s report by the European Commission and said Ukraine needs to ensure progress in fighting corruption. “We will now watch developments in this concrete case and, if necessary, consequences will have to be drawn from it,” Kornelius said. But “at the moment we have confidence in the Ukrainian government that it will ensure this be cleared up, and in the anti-corruption authority that it will lay bare this case and it will be brought to a transparent conclusion.” ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-front-zaporizhzhia-d35f629768d525338434eb777ea06647","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:17:55+00:00","title":"Russian Forces Expand Attacks in Ukraine Amid U.S. Sanctions and Domestic Scandals","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, the Russian military expanded its operations across multiple regions of Ukraine, including the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions, where it captured settlements and intensified attacks.

Dense fog enabled Russian troops to infiltrate Ukrainian positions in Zaporizhzhia, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on the messaging app Telegram, adding that Ukrainian units are locked in “grueling battles” to repel the Russian thrust. He noted, however, that the fiercest battles are still in the besieged Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk , in the eastern Donetsk region, where close to half of all front-line clashes took place over the previous 24 hours. The cities of Kupiansk and Lyman in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region have also recently witnessed an uptick in combat. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor almost four years ago and now occupies roughly one fifth of Ukrainian land. New U.S. sanctions that take aim at Russia’s oil sector, which is the mainstay of the Russian economy, are due to come into force on Nov. 21. Their purpose is to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept a ceasefire. Kyiv officials, meanwhile, risk being distracted by a growing corruption scandal engulfing senior members of the government. Ukraine’s Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko was suspended from his post Wednesday after being placed under investigation, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko announced. Russian gains come at a cost The U.S. sanctions on Russia’s biggest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, raise the stakes for Putin. The Russian leader has so far avoided serious top-level peace negotiations, with Ukrainian and Western officials accusing him of stalling for time while his army tries to grab more Ukrainian territory. International peace efforts have come to nothing. Russia’s bigger and better-equipped army has scaled up its attacks, placing the short-handed Ukrainian military under severe strain. Ukrainian officials said in September that the front line has grown in length to nearly 1,250 kilometers (800 miles). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Donetsk. Over the past four weeks, the Russian Defense Ministry has reported capturing nine settlements and villages in Donetsk: eight in the Zaporizhzhia region, seven in the Dnipropetrovsk region and five in the Kharkiv region. Russia’s corrosive war of attrition has been costly in terms of casualties and armor, however, and Ukraine has held it to incremental battlefield gains. The Institute for the Study of War said Russia’s siege of Pokrovsk, where it has deployed elite drone operators and “spetsnaz” special forces soldiers, has been slow-moving because its military commanders are spreading their resources widely. Russia is pursuing several offensive operations across the theater simultaneously and is having difficulty extending logistical operations, the Washington-based think tank said late Tuesday. Ukraine, meanwhile, has launched sustained long-range drone attacks on high-value military-related assets inside Russia. Its latest assault hit the Stavrolen chemical plant in Budionnovsk, in the Stavropol region of Russia, overnight, according to the general staff. The plant produces polymers for composite materials used by the Russian military, it said. ___ Associated Press writer Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1313-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article presents a diverse range of global events from 2025, including personal resilience (Warda Abu Jarad baking to support her family), environmental challenges in Sri Lanka due to invasive snakehead fish, political shifts in South Asia with India appearing politically stable, criticism of US foreign policy tactics by South African President Ramaphosa, road safety concerns in a bus collision linked to alcohol, high-stakes NBA matchups featuring Stephen Curry and Jannik Sinner, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s defense of controversial drug strikes, and ongoing scrutiny of former President Donald Trump due to revelations about ties to a sex offender.

Paying Americans, instead of insurers, for health coverage? Dividends of $2,000 from tariff revenues? Bonuses for air traffic controllers who showed up for work during the shutdown? All proposed by the president in the span of a few days.\n\nWe looked at each of these proposals, and whether policy experts think they are likely to come to fruition.\n\nEach idea is, for now, little more than a presidential musing on social media. To become reality, most would require formal proposals and legislation passed by both chambers of Congress. Other ideas, such as the mortgages, would likely require significant action by lenders.\n\nOn November 8, Trump posted to Truth Social side-by-side portraits of President Franklin D Roosevelt and himself, with “30-year mortgage” above Roosevelt and “50-year mortgage” above Trump. A headline said, “Great American Presidents.”\n\nThe notion quickly drew backlash, among both housing policy experts and Trump’s own base of supporters. Politico reported that the idea had originated with Federal Housing Director Bill Pulte.\n\nTrump told Fox News’s Laura Ingraham on November 10, “All it means is you pay less per month. Pay it over a longer period of time. It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.” During the interview, Ingraham corrected Trump, a lifelong real estate developer, when he said mortgages last 40 years today, rather than 30.\n\nTrump ignores the downsides of 50-year mortgages, experts say.\n\nFirst, a borrower would pay far more interest over the loan’s life.\n\nStijn Van Nieuwerburgh, a Columbia University real estate and finance professor, offered an example of a $450,000 home. With a fixed interest rate of 6.2 percent and a 20 percent down payment, a borrower would pay about $434,000 in interest with a 30-year mortgage, and more than $800,000 in interest with a 50-year mortgage.\n\nMortgages are structured so that a borrower is mostly paying off interest during the loan’s early years. Getting a 50-year mortgage lengthens the period of heavy interest payments and delays equity accumulation. With a 30-year mortgage, a 30-year-old buyer who wanted to stay in their home could expect to own it mortgage-free by age 60, but the same borrower with a 50-year mortgage would not own the home outright until age 80.\n\nVan Nieuwerburgh warned that lower monthly payments might entice buyers to spend more on housing, which could push up housing prices, hampering any wider benefits to real estate affordability.\n\nIn another November 8 Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over.”\n\nTrump elaborated during his Ingraham interview, saying, “Instead of going to the insurance companies, I want the money to go into an account for people where the people buy their own health insurance. It’s so good. The insurance will be better. It’ll cost less.”\n\nWithout a formal proposal, it’s difficult to evaluate how this might work. But it seems similar to existing Health Savings Accounts, often favoured by conservatives. These accounts let people set aside money before taxes to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as deductibles and copayments.\n\nHowever, under current law, these accounts’ funds generally cannot be used to pay insurance premiums. That would not necessarily be the case with Trump’s proposal.\n\nSome progressives said if Trump wants to cut out insurance companies, expanding Medicare to everyone would be a way to accomplish that.\n\n“Yes, Mr President: You’re right. We do have ‘the worst health care’ of any major country,” Senator Bernie Sanders responded on X. “Despite spending twice as much per capita, we are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all as a human right. The solution: Medicare for All.”\n\nTrump promised Americans $2,000 each from what he called the “trillions of dollars” in tariff revenue he said his administration has collected.\n\n“People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!,” Trump said in a November 9 Truth Social post. “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n\nThere are no formal proposals yet for these tariff dividends. Trump did not define the income cutoff and did not say whether children would receive the payment. He also has not said what form the payments might take, such as a check or tax credit.\n\nThere’s no certainty that the tariff revenue would be enough to cover the cost of a $2,000-per-person dividend.\n\nThrough the end of October, the federal government collected about $144bn in tariffs above the 2024 level, when tariffs were much less widespread. Tax policy specialists say tariff revenue collection could increase to more than $200bn a year if Trump’s tariffs remain in place.\n\nBut the Tax Foundation calculated that a $2,000 tariff dividend for each person earning under $100,000 would cover 150 million adult recipients and cost nearly $300bn, or more if children qualified. That’s well above the amount of money the tariffs have raised so far.\n\nMeanwhile, a new payout would have to be approved by Congress – and lawmakers have already declined to act on that idea once, when they passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Trump’s tariff powers would also have to pass muster with the Supreme Court, which is hearing a challenge to them.\n\nAs the shutdown dragged into its second month, Trump criticised air traffic controllers who called in sick, a tactic some believe was a protest against having to work without pay. The absences hampered the commercial aviation system.\n\nOn Truth Social, Trump wrote, “For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn’t take ANY TIME OFF for the ‘Democrat Shutdown Hoax,’ I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country.”\n\nThis would require action from Congress, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged in an X post.\n\n“To those who have worked throughout the shutdown — thank you for your patriotism and commitment to keeping our skies safe,” Duffy said. “I will work with Congress to reward your commitment.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a dire water crisis as its sixth consecutive year of drought worsens, with precipitation levels dropping by 81% compared to historical averages.

2025-11-12T13:46:39+00:00\n\nTitle: As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31Z","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe geomagnetic storm, rated G4 by NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, is affecting Earth due to multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, with two already impacting Earth and a third expected on Wednesday.

Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nGeomagnetic storms occur when storms on the sun trigger disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field. A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/indigenous-activists-storm-cop30-climate-summit-in-brazil-demanding-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:16:29+00:00","title":"Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including members of the Tupinamba community and organized through the Yaku Mama flotilla, protested at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding that climate policies respect Indigenous land rights and exclude extractive industries like oil drilling and logging.

Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/gaza-woman-blinded-in-israeli-strike-opens-bakery-to-subsist-and-hope","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:29:20Z","title":"Gaza woman blinded in Israeli strike opens bakery to subsist and hope","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warda Abu Jarad, a 51-year-old woman from Gaza, lost her sight in an Israeli airstrike that destroyed her home, leaving her with permanent blindness and difficulty navigating even her own tent.

Israeli air strike has opened a bakery to make ends meet and keep her hopes for the future alive, she tells Al Jazeera.\n\nWarda Abu Jarad, 51, is one of 170,698 Palestinians who have been wounded in  Gaza  since Israel began its genocidal war on the territory in October 2023.\n\nAbu Jarad explained that she lost her sight when her house was bombed by the Israeli military, causing debris to fall into her eyes.\n\n“The smoke from the bombing blinded me completely,” she said.\n\nSpeaking from a tent in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, the mother told Al Jazeera that she was still adjusting to being blind and needs someone to guide her whenever she wants to move from one place to another.\n\n“Even when I want to move inside the tent, I wait for someone to help me cross,” she said. “I tried to enter the tent once, hit my head and fell, … so now I feel the ground with my feet to know what’s in front of me.”\n\nHer daughter has been her biggest support, she said.\n\nHer blindness has been hard for her to take. “The most precious thing in life is sight. Every time I struggle to reach something I need, I start crying,” Abu Jarad said.\n\nDespite such challenges, Abu Jarad is, like other Palestinians in Gaza, trying to rebuild her life amid the ruins, ongoing Israeli bombardment, restricted aid and grief.\n\n“I decided to open a business to provide for my family. I opened a bakery and started to grow it. I started baking ma’amoul [filled butter cookies] and bread,” she said one month into a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“I need to keep going because the situation here is so hard,” she added.\n\nSince the ceasefire came into effect on October 10, there have been some small improvements in daily life in Gaza, but the United Nations and NGOs have warned that the amount of aid Israel is letting into Gaza remains wholly insufficient.\n\nIsrael claims it has adhered to the truce by permitting entry to 600 aid trucks each day while Hamas says the daily number is actually about 150.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said it had reopened  the Zikim crossing  to the northern Gaza Strip.\n\n“The opening of direct crossings to the north is vital to ensure that sufficient aid reaches people as soon as possible,” the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said recently.\n\n“All I want in life is to have my sight restored, and I want to see my daughter as a bride in her wedding dress.

Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit, hosted in Belem, Brazil, brings together over 50,000 delegates from 190+ countries to focus on implementing existing climate commitments rather than setting new ones.

conference\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations climate change conference (COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/australias-first-treaty-with-aboriginal-people-signed-in-state-of-victoria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:34:34+00:00","title":"Australia’s first treaty with Aboriginal people signed in state of Victoria","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has signed its first treaty between Indigenous people and the government in the state of Victoria, marking a historic turning point in the nation’s relationship with Aboriginal peoples.

rage in India’s youngest state?\n\nPatna, India  – As 20-year-old Ajay Kumar scrolled through social media on his mobile phone in Muzaffarpur district in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, he came across rumours that a crucial examination for a government job he had appeared for had been compromised.\n\nAjay is a Dalit, a community that falls at the bottom of India’s caste hierarchy and has suffered centuries of marginalisation. He had pinned his hopes for the future on a job reserved for his community under the government’s affirmative action programme.\n\nBut the leaking of the examination paper in December last year dashed those hopes.\n\nThat’s when he came across a video of students as old as him – and just as angry – protesting the paper leak in state capital Patna, some 75km (46 miles) away. He immediately hopped on an overnight bus and found himself among thousands of protesters the next morning.\n\nAjay spent the next 100 days in biting cold, demonstrating and often sleeping in the open, huddled with hundreds of other students. Their demand was simple: A re-examination. But in April this year, India’s Supreme Court dismissed the students’ petitions to conduct the re-examination.\n\nA furious Ajay contained his anger for months. On November 6, as he voted in the first phase of a two-part election to choose Bihar’s state legislature, Ajay pressed a button on the electronic voting machine hard, hoping his choice would avenge the struggle of students like him.\n\nAs  Gen Z protests  topple governments across South Asia, regional giant India – the largest and most populous of all – has been an exception. A Hindu majoritarian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been in power since 2014. In Bihar, a coalition of BJP and its partners has been governing for most of the past two decades, under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.\n\nYet, Gen Z anger is palpable in Bihar, which neighbours Nepal, where young protesters toppled the government in September, demanding an end to corruption and elite privileges.\n\nBihar has the youngest population among Indian states. Government data show 40 percent of the state’s 128 million population is under 18, while about 23 percent is between 18-29 years of age.\n\nAt the same time, one in three Bihari families live in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank, also making it India’s poorest state.\n\nThe anger of its youth has meant that Bihar witnessed 400 student protests between 2018 and 2022, the highest in the country, according to national government data.\n\nAnd many like Ajay are seeking to channel that anger into electoral changes.\n\nThe two-phase election in Bihar, held on November 6 and November 11, saw more than 74 million eligible voters elect their representatives for the 243-member regional assembly.\n\nThe results will be declared on November 14.\n\nAs more and more youngsters express discontent with their ruling elite across South Asia, political observers believe the Bihar election will indicate whether Modi – who campaigned extensively in the state – is still able to retain his hold on the crucial demographic in India, home to the world’s largest youth population. Of India’s 1.45 billion people, 65 percent are less than 35 years of age.\n\nOr will Modi’s principal opponents – led by a much younger Tejashwi Yadav of the Bihar-based Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party and Rahul Gandhi of the main opposition Congress party – be able to tap into the frustrations of Bihar’s youth?\n\nBihar languishes at the bottom of most of India’s multidimensional human development indices, which take into account factors such as nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling and maternal health, among others.\n\nPratham Kumar, 20, is from Jehanabad district in southern Bihar. He had to move to state capital Patna because colleges in his hometown offered “no teaching, only degrees”.\n\nBut studying is a struggle even in Patna, he says. The university hostel does not have clean drinking water, the wi-fi router has been non-functional for months, and students like him often end up mowing the lawns of their cramped hostels since hostel authorities don’t have adequate housekeeping staff to do so.\n\n“Across Bihar, the state of education is so poor that you just enrol yourself in a college for a degree on paper, but if you actually want to learn, you need to enrol in private coaching classes at an extra cost,” he fumes.\n\nPratham is now looking to move out of the state – the only alternative for millions of students and unemployed Biharis. A 2020 study by the Mumbai-based International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS) found that more than half the households in the state depended on remittances from their loved ones who had migrated to other states or abroad.\n\nPratham’s friend, Ishant Kumar, is from Darbhanga, another district in Bihar. He is angry at the young forced to migrate in search of a better life, and points to instances of anti-migrant violence in parts of India, often targeting Biharis.\n\n“The poverty here pushes young Biharis out, and then, they are insulted, assaulted and have no dignity,” he tells Al Jazeera. “From Kolkata to Maharashtra, only Biharis get attacked and mocked at.”\n\nIshant is angry that successive state governments have not done enough to stem migration. “The cream of Bihar migrates and contributes to the development of other regions in the country. Instead, why can’t we create opportunities here for them to grow?” he asks.\n\nIn Vaishali district, 23-year-old Komal Kumari believes she has already wasted two years of her life due to government inefficiency.\n\nKomal, like Ajay, is a Dalit. Her family survives on a 9,000-rupee (about $100) monthly stipend that her mother earns as an “anganwadi” (childcare) worker employed by the government. Komal, like millions of girls across Bihar, was promised a 50,000 rupee ($565) cash transfer in 2021 by the Bihar government that the BJP is part of, if she earned a graduate degree.\n\nKomal, who completed her Bachelor of Arts with political science honours in 2023, has been waiting for that money for two years now.\n\nShe’s hoping to qualify for teaching jobs, but for that, she needs a two-year degree, a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed), which would cost her approximately 75,000 ($846). But she has no savings – she has already spent nearly 100,000 rupees ($1,128) on her first college degree and at coaching centres she went to, to improve her chances at examinations for several government jobs.\n\nNow, she can’t pursue either the B.Ed. or the coaching for government job examinations.\n\nAnd she is angry. “I spent so much money only because the government had promised a cash transfer. If they had been prompt, I would have not wasted two years, waiting around.”\n\nRamanshu Mishra owns Ramanshu GS classes, a popular coaching centre in Patna for young Biharis eager to apply for government jobs. He says Ishant and Komal are speaking for most students in the state.\n\n“Students are constantly angry here. When they are studying, they are angry at poor educational facilities. When they finish studying, they are angry at the lack of employment opportunities,” Mishra tells Al Jazeera.\n\nGovernment data show the joblessness rate in urban Bihar between 15-29 years of age is at 22 percent, much higher than the national average of 14.7 percent.\n\nThis is why Bihar becomes a testing ground for both Modi’s BJP, which is a leading partner in the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in Bihar, and its challenger, the opposition  INDIA alliance , led by the RJD and the Congress. The INDIA alliance has announced 36-year-old RJD chief Yadav as its chief ministerial face, while the NDA is banking on 75-year-old Modi and the incumbent chief minister, Nitish Kumar, who is 74.\n\n“The verdict will show whether the youngest state of India chooses a young leadership [opposition alliance] or whether it chooses to be with the old [NDA],” Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a journalist and author of Modi’s biography, among other books, told Al Jazeera.\n\nBoth sides have been trying hard to woo the young. In an election speech last month, Modi said his government’s policies enabled Biharis to make money through social media ‘reels’. “I have ensured that 1GB data costs no more than a cup of tea,” he said.\n\nThe Modi-led NDA committed in their election manifesto to creating 10 million jobs in Bihar, if voted back to power, while the opposition INDIA bloc’s central poll plank in the election is their promise to ensure one government job per family in Bihar within 20 days of coming to power.\n\nThe Congress party’s Gandhi, 55, has also repeatedly urged Gen Z voters to “stay vigilant” and stop electoral malpractices he has alleged have been occurring in several Indian elections in the past few years. Gandhi has alleged that the ruling BJP has been committing voter fraud by adding ineligible and fake voters to the country’s electoral rolls. The opposition has also criticised the country’s Election Commission for being complicit in it. The Election Commission had faced criticism for a controversial revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls on the eve of the elections, which resulted in 3.04 million voters being deleted disproportionately from districts with high numbers of Muslim voters – who typically vote against the BJP.\n\n“If the opposition’s young leadership loses, it will put Modi in a very advantageous situation,” Mukhopadhyay said. “Because it means that even though he is 75, the youth continue to plug for him.”\n\n(Ajay Kumar’s name has been changed since he fears his participation in the protest could dent his career prospects.)"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/israeli-president-condemns-shocking-settler-attacks-in-occupied-west-bank","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:33:21+00:00","title":"Israeli president condemns ‘shocking’ settler attacks in occupied West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Army Chief Eyal Zamir have issued rare public condemnations of a surge in settler attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, describing the violence as 'shocking' and 'serious' and emphasizing that such acts cross a red line.

Herzog and army chief Eyal Zamir have condemned burgeoning Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in a rare public rebuke of what has become  a daily cycle of violence  often backed by the Israeli military.\n\nHerzog on Wednesday described the attacks as “shocking and serious,” adding a rare and powerful voice to what has been heavily muted criticism by top Israeli officials of the settler violence, which involves killings and beatings of civilians and destruction of their property.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Israeli settlers vandalised a mosque near the town of Salfit in the occupied West Bank, according to the Wafa news agency.\n\nQuoting a local activist, the agency reported that Israeli settlers poured flammable material at the entrance of the mosque and wrote racial slurs on its walls. The report said residents helped put the fire out before it spread through the mosque.\n\nDozens of masked Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian villages in the West Bank on Tuesday, setting fire to vehicles and other property before fighting with Israeli soldiers.\n\nHerzog said the violence, committed by a “handful” of perpetrators, “crosses a red line”, adding in a social media post that “all state authorities must act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon.”\n\nZamir also strongly condemned the recent sharp increase in attacks.\n\n“We are aware of the recent violent incidents in which Israeli civilians attacked Palestinians and Israelis,” Zamir was quoted on Wednesday by the Israeli army as saying.\n\n“I strongly condemn them,” he said, adding that the Israeli military “will not tolerate criminal behaviour by a small minority that tarnishes the law-abiding public”.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was worried recent violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank could spill over and undermine US-backed peace efforts in Gaza.\n\n“I hope not,” Rubio told reporters after a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Canada when asked whether the events could endanger the Gaza ceasefire.\n\n“We don’t expect it to. We’ll do everything we can to make sure it doesn’t happen.”\n\nIn Tuesday’s incidents, settlers attacked the villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf, setting fire to four dairy trucks, farmland, tin shacks and tents belonging to a Bedouin community.\n\nPalestinian official Muayyad Shaaban said the attacks were part of a campaign to drive Palestinians from their land and accused Israel of giving the settlers protection and immunity.\n\nIsraeli police said four Israelis were arrested in what they described as “extremist violence”.\n\nA video verified by Al Jazeera shows several vehicles on fire as Palestinians try to extinguish the flames.\n\nIsraeli soldiers were also attacked by a group of settlers, and a military vehicle was damaged. That is a rare occurrence as settlers have rampaged with impunity, often with the military’s backing.\n\nIsraeli forces and settlers carried out  2,350 attacks  across the West Bank last month in an “ongoing cycle of terror”, the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission (CRRC) reported last week.\n\nCRRC head Mu’ayyad Sha’ban said Israeli forces carried out 1,584 attacks – including direct physical attacks, the demolition of homes and the uprooting of olive trees – with most of the violence focused on the governorates of Ramallah (542), Nablus (412) and Hebron (401).\n\nSettler attacks often escalate during the  olive harvest  from September to November, a vital time of year that provides a key source of income for many Palestinian families.\n\nOn Monday, B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group,  said  settlers were attacking Palestinians “daily”, including “shooting, beating and threatening residents, throwing stones, torching fields, destroying trees and crops, stealing produce, blocking roads, invading homes, and burning cars”.\n\nIsraeli settlements are Jewish-only  communities built  on Palestinian land that Israel occupied in 1967. They are illegal under international law.\n\nToday, 600,000 to 750,000 settlers live in more than 250 settlements and outposts across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. Many of these are near Palestinian towns and villages, often leading to tensions and severe movement restrictions for Palestinians.\n\nSettlers are often armed and frequently accompanied or protected by Israeli soldiers. In addition to destroying Palestinian property, they have carried out arson attacks and killed Palestinian residents."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/13/live-israel-attacks-gazas-south-north-during-repeatedly-violated-truce","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:26:04+00:00","title":"Israel attacks Gaza’s south, north during repeatedly violated truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel launched military attacks on both the southern and northern regions of Gaza, despite a previously agreed truce being repeatedly violated.

has drafted a legal opinion stating that US military personnel involved in military strikes off the coast of Latin America are immune from prosecution, The Washington Post and the Reuters news agency have reported.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel provided the White House with the opinion on the issue of criminal liability for the strikes on vessels in the Caribbean, the outlets reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe strikes on alleged drug traffickers have come under intense scrutiny from Democrats, legal experts and even some Republicans since they began in September.\n\nThe US military has carried out at least 19 strikes on boats allegedly transporting drugs in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 76 people.\n\nThe White House claims the strikes are part of “a non-international armed conflict” against “narcoterrorists” and “unlawful combatants” with ties to Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe Trump administration has not released evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.\n\nThe administration of former US President George W Bush coined the term “unlawful combatant” to deny certain enemies of the US protections under the Geneva Convention.\n\nThe term, which is not mentioned in the Convention, is controversial in international law and has been rejected by many human rights advocates and legal experts.\n\n“The Maduro regime is a narco-terrorist regime indicted in the Southern District of the United States for narco-terrorism, but more importantly, they're also a transshipment organization that allows these groups to operate from their national territory.” —  @SecRubio   pic.twitter.com/RP9sVJcbZk\n\n— Department of State (@StateDept)  November 13, 2025\n\nWashington’s actions have made even some of its closest allies uncomfortable.\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that the UK had stopped sharing intelligence on drug trafficking operations with the US, though London and Washington have otherwise deep intelligence and defence ties.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the same day that the strikes violated international law as he attended a minister-level meeting of the G7 in Canada.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters that none of the G7 members had raised the issue during the two-day summit, according to Reuters.\n\n“I don’t think that the European Union gets to determine what international law is,” Rubio told reporters on Wednesday from a US airbase.\n\n“They certainly don’t get to determine how the United States defends its national security.”\n\nRubio also denied the CNN report.\n\n“Nothing has changed or happened that has impeded in any way our ability to do what we’re doing,” Rubio said.\n\n“Nor are we asking anyone to help us with what we’re doing.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/new-review-urges-uk-to-repatriate-shamima-begum-others-from-syria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"08:49:24+00:00","title":"New

ISIL (ISIS) member  Shamima Begum  and others living in Syrian camps and deprived of British nationality, a new report has urged.\n\nThe Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and

government should facilitate voluntary repatriation for British nationals, including those deprived of British nationality,” it asserted.\n\n“A coherent, humane, and security-conscious repatriation strategy would strengthen compliance with international obligations and promote long-term public safety and social stability.”\n\nBegum’s case lies at the heart of the UK policy of revoking the citizenship of nationals who joined armed groups in Syria. She left London in 2015 as a minor, at the age of 15, with two school friends, and later married an ISIL fighter. Begum gave birth to three children, all of whom died in infancy.\n\nIn 2019, the UK government revoked her citizenship soon after she was discovered in a detention camp in Syria.\n\nSince then, she has challenged the decision, which was turned down by an appeals court in February 2024. Born in the UK to Bangladeshi parents, Begum does not hold Bangladeshi citizenship.\n\nShe had admitted that she joined the organisation knowing it was proscribed as a “terror” group, and has said she was “ashamed” and regretted joining the group.\n\nCiting the United Nations, the report described conditions at the camps, including the infamous al-Hol and al-Roj camps, as “inhuman, dangerous, and degrading”.\n\n“Many detainees, especially women and children, are victims of coercion, trafficking, or exploitation, even if some have been involved in terrorism-related activity,” it added.\n\nAccording to the commission, between 55-72 UK-linked individuals remain in the camps and other detention centres, including 30-40 children.\n\nThe report said the UK’s “reluctance” to repatriate its citizens, including those stripped of their citizenship, made it an “outlier” among “comparable jurisdictions” and could prove to be “counterproductive to long-term security interests”.\n\n“Pressure from the US government, which has called for all states to take back their nationals, the change in the Syrian regime, and as other states repatriate, the prospect of what was referred to as ‘Europe’s Guantanamo’ becoming ‘Britain’s Guantanamo’, may force the government to begin returns,” the report pointed out."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) has opened in Belem, Brazil, with world leaders emphasizing unity and urgent action to combat climate change.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/us-house-to-vote-on-full-release-of-epstein-files-next-week-johnson-says","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:51:04+00:00","title":"US House to vote on full release of Epstein files next week, Johnson says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on releasing all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, following a bipartisan discharge petition signed by 218 lawmakers, including 214 Democrats and four Republicans.

Trump cited South Africa’s treatment of white farmers, which he has falsely labelled a “genocide”, writing on his Truth Social platform that it was a “total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa”.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly claimed that white South Africans are being violently persecuted and having their land taken from them because of their race in the Black-majority country, a claim rejected by South Africa’s government and top Afrikaner officials.\n\nTrump for months has targeted the nation’s Black-led government for criticism over that and a range of other issues, including its decision to accuse staunch US ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in an ongoing case at the ICJ in The Hague.\n\nLast month, Ramaphosa said the current Gaza ceasefire, which  Israel is violating  on a daily basis, will not affect his country’s genocide case against Israel, stressing that South Africa is determined to pursue its case, filed in 2023, despite the truce, which is part of a US-backed plan aimed at ending Israel’s war on the besieged and bombarded territory.\n\nSouth Africa submitted 500 pages of  evidence  to the ICJ in October 2024. Israel’s counterarguments are due by January 12. Oral hearings are anticipated in 2027 with a final judgement expected in late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nThe ICJ has issued three provisional measures, ordering Israel to prevent genocidal acts and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel has largely failed to comply.\n\n“It is unfortunate that the United States decided not to attend the G20,” Ramaphosa told reporters outside the South African Parliament on Wednesday. “The United States by not being at the G20, one must never think that we are not going to go on with the G20. The G20 will go on. All other heads of state will be here. In the end, we will take fundamental decisions and their absence is their loss.”\n\nRamaphosa added that the US is “giving up the very important role that they should be playing as the biggest economy in the world”.\n\nTrump previously confronted Ramaphosa with his baseless claims that the Afrikaner white minority in South Africa were being killed in widespread attacks when the leaders met at the White House in May. At that meeting, Ramaphosa lobbied for Trump to attend the G20 summit, the first to be held in Africa.\n\nThe G20 was formed in 1999 to bring rich and developing countries together to address issues affecting the global economy and international development. The US, China, Russia, India, Japan, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union are all members. The US is due to take over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa at the end of the year.\n\nTrump’s claims about anti-white violence and persecution in South Africa have reflected those made previously by conservative media commentators in the US as far back as 2018.\n\nTrump and others, including South African-born Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, have also accused South Africa’s government of being racist against whites because of its affirmative action laws that aim to advance opportunities for the Black majority, which was oppressed under the former apartheid system of racial segregation.\n\nRamaphosa’s government has said the comments are the result of misinformation and a lack of understanding about South Africa.\n\nRelations between the US and its biggest trading partner in Africa are at their lowest since the end of apartheid in 1994. Washington expelled the South African ambassador to the US in March over comments he made regarding Trump."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, after it was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report stating that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure—currently affecting 2 billion people and with over 3,500 new sites under development—is endangering billions of lives, exacerbating climate change, and violating human rights.

fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix and a 1962 Nobel Prize laureate, has died at the age of 97.

controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for

a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science.

The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is enforcing a ban on children under 16 from accessing major social media platforms including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, effective December 10, 2025.

16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on

We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-11:11","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article from Al Jazeera highlights a range of science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm watch from the US weather agency, concerns over misinformation from former President Trump regarding nuclear weapons and autism, and global technological shifts such as Nvidia’s expansion amid the US-China trade war, OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation, and mRNA vaccine breakthroughs for cancer treatment.

Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, located 11 billion light years away in a distant galaxy.

Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rj0d97ynvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:21:33.568+00:00","title":"What we know about the latest Epstein emails referencing Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US lawmakers have released over 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including emails that reference President Donald Trump, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew.

They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\n\n\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\".\n\nEpstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".\n\nMaxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"\n\nThe victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\".\n\nThe White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre,  a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year . In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".\n\nGiuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse.  And in a memoir released this year , she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.\n\nAsked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.\n\nIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who   - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office.\n\nIn a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".\n\nEpstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nWolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\n\"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.\n\nA third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.\n\nIn it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\".\n\nEpstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\".\n\nResponding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nAs well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.\n\nHe responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.\n\nAndrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"\n\nMaxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.\n\nThe right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.\n\nOn 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.\n\nLord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.\n\nThey show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016 , according to the documents.\n\nThe latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAn email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".\n\nLord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".\n\nEpstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.\n\nEpstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.\n\nLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.\n\nAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released.\n\nIn it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"\n\nFarmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6291204278o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:24:54.546+00:00","title":"France remembers Bataclan attacks but knows enemy has not gone away","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As France marks the 10th anniversary of the Bataclan massacre, where 130 people were killed in a coordinated terrorist attack on a concert hall in Paris, a former girlfriend of the only surviving attacker, Salah Abdeslam, has been arrested on suspicion of plotting a jihadist act.

come of the permanence of the jihadist threat.\n\nA former girlfriend of the only jihadist to survive the November 2015 attacks has been arrested on suspicion of plotting her own violent act.\n\nThe woman - a 27 year-old French convert to Islam named as Maëva B - began a letter-writing relationship with Salah Abdeslam, 36, who is serving a life sentence in jail near the Belgian border following his conviction in 2022.\n\nWhen prison guards discovered that Abdeslam had been using a USB key containing jihadist propaganda, they traced its origin to face-to-face meetings that the prisoner had with Maëva B.\n\nDetectives then looked into Maëva B's own computer and telephone, where they found evidence she may have been planning a jihadist attack, and on Monday she was placed under judicial investigation along with two alleged associates.\n\nWith France commemorating 10 years since the worst attack in its modern history,  the arrest has focused minds on the enemy that never went away.\n\nSix plots have been thwarted this year, says Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and the threat level remains high.\n\nOn the evening of 13 November 2015, jihadist gunmen and suicide bombers conducted a sequence of co-ordinated attacks that culminated in a bloody raid on the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris.\n\nBefore that, three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France where a football international was under way. Then others in the gang opened fire with Kalashnikovs on people drinking in bars and cafés not far from the Bataclan.\n\nThere,  a performance by American group The Eagles of Death Metal had just started, when three jihadists burst in and fired indiscriminately into the auditorium.  They took hostages and then blew themselves up as police moved in.\n\nOverall 130 people were killed, 90 in the Bataclan, and more than 400 treated in hospital. Countless others suffered psychological trauma.\n\nThe word Bataclan has since become a byword in France for extreme Islamist attacks, in much the same way that 9/11 did in the US.\n\nThough there have been other attacks since, like the Nice lorry massacre of July 2016 and the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020, the scale and organisation of 13 November 2015 set it apart.\n\nTen years on, much has changed. The disappearance of the Islamic State (IS) group as a major force in Syria and Iraq means that the wherewithal to conceive, plan and carry out complex terrorist projects is greatly diminished.\n\nThe Bataclan attackers were young men of mainly North African origin, recruited in Belgium and France, trained in IS territory in the Middle East, who then returned to Europe hidden among a vast flow of migrants.\n\nEverywhere they could draw on a network of supporters offering shelter, transport and cash.\n\nAccording to leading Middle East expert Gilles Kepel, intelligence services have also become highly effective in controlling online radicalisation.\n\n\"They now have access to IT resources… which allow them to detect a lot of individual initiatives, often not very sophisticated ones... and stop them before they hatch,\" he said in an interview with Le Figaro.\n\nBut according to Mr Kepel, the danger now comes from what he calls \"ambient jihadism\".\n\n\"The threat is now home-grown and a lot younger. It feeds on friendships and social networks of the like-minded, without there ever necessarily being people having to give and obey orders,\" he said.\n\nThe threat is all the more concerning, he believes, because it is so porous - with events in Gaza and Israel having a \"traumatic effect\" on the minds of many citizens and being \"exploited by the entrepreneurs of anger\".\n\nFrance's current political crisis is also stoking the danger, he argues, with an impotent presidency giving way to a partisan parliament where extremists of left and right hold increasing sway.\n\n\"If what separates us becomes more important than what unites us as French people and fractures the national consensus, then there will open a chasm beneath our feet and violence will have fewer and fewer restraints,\" he said.\n\nThursday's commemorations will be held throughout the day at the various attack sites, culminating with the opening of a 13 November garden near Paris City Hall.\n\nWhen night falls, the Eiffel Tower will be bathed in the red, white and blue of the French flag.\n\nFrench media have been full of accounts and memories, with survivors describing how their lives have changed.\n\nIn an unexpected development, Salah Abdeslam has let it be known through his lawyer that he would be prepared to co-operate in any effort at \"restorative justice\" - a procedure where victims and perpetrators meet to discuss the impact of a crime.\n\nThe idea has been mooted by some families - but others are vehemently opposed.\n\nAccording to Laurent Sourisseau, a cartoonist also known as Riss, who was shot and wounded in the Charlie Hebdo attack a few months before the Bataclan massacres, Abdeslam's offer is \"perverse\".\n\n\"Restorative justice exists for other types of crime - common crimes,\" he said.\n\n\"But terrorism is not a common crime. Salah Abdeslam wants to make us think his crime was like any other. But it was not.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s announcement to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, clarifying that the planned tests are noncritical and do not involve nuclear explosions.

‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl60yp9g6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"08:45:20.856+00:00","title":"Where does mudslinging over leadership leave Starmer's government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a political crisis within Keir Starmer's Labour government, sparked by anonymous briefings that suggested cabinet ministers, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, were plotting to challenge the Prime Minister.

2025-11-13T08:45:20.856+00:00\n\nTitle: Where does mudslinging over leadership leave Starmer's government?\n\n\"It's not been our finest 24 hours in government,\" one senior figure in government acknowledged to me, after mudslinging one way and another, some in public, plenty more in private.\n\nIt began with anonymous briefings to journalists, including myself, that Keir Starmer would fight any attempt to remove him - and that cabinet ministers, including Wes Streeting, were plotting challenges.\n\nStreeting insisted he was loyal to the PM and called on those behind the briefings to be sacked, and the PM announced that any attacks on his ministers were \"unacceptable\".\n\nQuestions about whether the PM had authorised the original briefings to flush out potential challengers - and whether those behind them were doing so with his knowledge, or approval, were thrown into the mix.\n\nWould there be a leak inquiry? Would there be sackings at what Streeting called a \"toxic\" Number 10 operation?\n\nWhat were those close to the prime minister hoping to achieve?\n\nI have been making loads of phone calls to patch together what actually happened and where all this leaves Keir Starmer's government.\n\nThere are two key facts at the heart of all of this: the government is unpopular and so is the prime minister.\n\nThese facts are the rocket fuel behind the constant conversations I hear about what Labour is trying to do about it and what it might mean for how long Sir Keir Starmer carries on in Downing Street.\n\nBut let's get to the aftermath of all that mudslinging.\n\nThe prime minister and Health Secretary Wes Streeting spoke on the phone on Wednesday evening to patch things up.\n\nI hear Sir Keir apologised to Streeting in the brief call and they agreed to talk in further detail \"soon\".\n\nThey didn't talk about Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister's chief of staff - who has become a lightning rod for criticism from everyone including the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in public to Labour figures junior and senior in private.\n\nWidely credited as the mastermind of Labour's election landslide and the political brain behind Sir Keir's quick rise since switching from Director of Public Prosecutions, McSweeney is also among the first to face criticism when the Downing Street machine is perceived to have stuttered, stumbled or outright failed.\n\nHe is not responding to requests for comment, as some call for his head on a stick.\n\nHis critics argue that in a Downing Street where McSweeney is called on to make plenty of big political judgements, he should take responsibility for how all of this unfolded.\n\nOthers in the building insist no-one who works there was behind any briefing against a cabinet minister, after Wes Streeting said whoever was responsible should be sacked.\n\nIn No 10, there is a tacit acknowledgement that the health secretary handled a round of pre-arranged interviews on Wednesday morning with dignity, aplomb and humour - despite being confronted by incessant questions about his own ambitions because those briefings about him came just hours before.\n\nFor some Labour MPs, he demonstrated a nimbleness and knack for communication they only wish the Prime Minister shared.\n\nIt also won't have gone unnoticed that at least some of those briefings that attempted to shore up the prime minister ended up creating an opportunity for Streeting to say he shared the sentiment of his colleagues who have described Downing Street as toxic and sexist and that those who were behind the briefings should be sacked.\n\nWhat a mess.\n\nThe prime minister, I am told, is \"incandescent\" at how all of this has played out and is looking into how it all happened.\n\nWhat appears to have gone awry, from No 10's perspective, is both volume and emphasis.\n\nFirstly, they had, perhaps naively, imagined that the briefings would generate some news, but not wall-to-wall headline news.\n\nIt turned out to be much louder than they had anticipated.\n\nI'd say a prime minister letting this kind of thing be known, via supporters, less than 18 months after a landslide general election win, was always going to be front page, top of bulletins stuff – as it turned out to be, on these pages and others.\n\nAnd secondly, on emphasis, they insist they hadn't expected so much talk about Wes Streeting, which was then massively magnified by all those interviews he was booked in to do on Wednesday morning.\n\nOthers, it must be said, concluded that that was precisely the intention.\n\nIt has been another few days where Labour folk in government talk about lessons being learnt and on the backbenches plenty are irritated at what they see as an absurd spectacle playing out that they have to firstly witness and then attempt to defend.\n\nAnd they would rather not do either.\n\nBut a government and a prime minister whose nervousness about their predicament is even bigger than their big majority will likely see repeats of this saga, unless they can quickly address the deep lack of popularity that drives it.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0ydl7dypo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"00:21:55.695+00:00","title":"The Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) and the row over Nigeria's Benin Bronzes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City, Nigeria, is facing a major political crisis just before its scheduled public opening.

row over Nigeria's Benin Bronzes\n\nNigeria's stunning new Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) has found itself in the crosshairs of local power politics on the week it was supposed to - but failed - to open its doors to the public for the first time.\n\nThe six-hectare (15-acre) campus sits in the heart of Benin City, capital of the southern state of Edo - and includes an archaeological dig and buildings designed by high-profile British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, best known for the National Museum of African American History and Culture that opened in Washington in 2016.\n\nIt has been five years in the making - and is envisioned to celebrate both the past and the present of creativity in the region famous for the Benin Bronzes, artworks looted from the city's royal palace by British soldiers in the 19th Century.\n\nIt is impressive - and ahead of the planned opening, Mowaa was buzzing with staff determined to prove it is a place that can rival established museums and galleries in the West.\n\nInside conservators carefully unwrapped artworks from protective packaging, inspecting each piece and taking meticulous records before positioning them on walls and plinths.\n\nTechnicians fine-tuned climate control systems. In the materials science laboratory, officers calibrated equipment meant to preserve centuries-old artefacts.\n\nThe project has been the brainchild of businessman Phillip Ihenacho - now Mowaa's executive director.\n\n\"I want us to have a significant economic impact on communities around here,\" he told the BBC, adding that he hoped to make Benin City \"a cultural destination\".\n\nMowaa, a non-profit Nigerian institution, sees itself creating more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing more than $80m (£60m) annually to the regional creative economy through partnerships and programming.\n\nIt has taken $25m (£19m) to get here - money raised from various donors, including the French and German governments, the British Museum and the Edo state government.\n\nBut now the local government has pulled the rug from under it - revoking the use of the land on which the museum was built.\n\nAn Edo state spokesperson told the BBC this was because in the original paperwork it had called itself Edo Museum of West African Art - and it had since dropped \"Edo\" from its name.\n\nThis announcement followed protests on Sunday, when people stormed the campus demanding it be called the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nA rowdy group insulted foreign guests at the museum ahead of the opening - forcing them to be hurried away under police escort.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu has even stepped in to try and resolve the tensions, setting up a high-level committee to do some damage control.\n\nBut how has this become so politicised - and such a PR disaster?\n\nMuch of it comes down to internecine rivalries at a local state level, as it was Edo's previous governor Godwin Obaseki - whose term in office ended last year - who was a major backer of the museum.\n\nAnd it seems the administration of the new governor, a close ally of the local traditional ruler, known as the Oba, may want more of a stake in the project. The protesters on Sunday, for example, were demanding that the museum be placed under the control of Oba Ewuare II.\n\nThis brings into focus the contentious issue of the Benin Bronzes, one of Africa's most celebrated cultural treasures.\n\nBecause even if the museum does eventually open, these bronzes will be conspicuously absent.\n\nThey are brass, ivory and wooden sculptures that once adorned the royal palace of the Benin Kingdom before British soldiers looted them in 1897 during a punitive expedition.\n\nToday, thousands remain scattered across museums in Europe and North America -- including the British Museum, Berlin's Humboldt Forum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nTheir return has become one of the most contested debates in the global art world. About 150 have now made their way home - and more are due to follow.\n\nWhen plans for the museum in Benin City were first announced in 2019, the movers and shakers on Nigeria's art scene hoped it would become their natural home - a state-of-the-art complex to show them off to the world.\n\nBut the waters were muddied two years ago after the federal government announced that the Oba would be the rightful owner and custodian of any returned bronzes - and the palace pushed for a museum under the royal family's direct control, against the wishes of Obaseki, the former governor.\n\nThis left Mowaa in a delicate position: asserting a clear stance on restitution while remaining diplomatic on custodianship - and emphasising its broader vision, which led to it dropping \"Edo\" from its name.\n\n\"One of the frustrations I've always had is that from the beginning we have said we will be about the modern and contemporary,\" said Mr Ihenacho.\n\n\"But because of the Western story about the return of the Benin Bronzes, everyone kept referring to us as the museum where they will go. The problem with that is we are not the owners, nor do we have any legal title to the bronzes.\"\n\nHis goal is to build a haven for contemporary African creativity, including film, photography, music, dance and fashion - not just visual art.\n\n\"Yes, we want to focus on the historical, but the purpose is to inspire the contemporary,\" he said.\n\n\"What we have become is a museum that is really about creating an ecosystem to support creatives in West Africa.\"\n\nFrom a young Nigerian artist who relocated from the US to work as a conservator, to a recent graduate undergoing his one-year mandatory national youth service programme, to a Ghanaian PhD candidate conducting research, Mowaa has already become a hub of regional collaboration.\n\nEweka Success, a 23-year-old sculpture graduate from the University of Benin who has had a tour of Mowaa, welcomed this opportunity.\n\nHe noted that while many residents of the city \"don't care\" about the restitution conversation, the museum still offered something valuable.\n\n\"Many of us have never seen the originals, but there we can study their design, technique and history more closely,\" he told the BBC.\n\nCultural specialist Oluwatoyin Sogbesan agrees that the conversation has grown increasingly elitist.\n\n\"The everyday person is concerned about making a living, going to work, and feeding their family. Many don't even know about the bronzes,\" she told the BBC.\n\nFor her, restitution must move beyond just the return of artefacts to also restore memory and language.\n\n\"We need to decolonise the term 'Benin Bronzes' itself,\" she explained.\n\n\"Call them by their original Edo name – 'Emwin Arre' [meaning 'Cultural Things'] - what the people who made them would have called them.\"\n\nThis is something that chimes with the museum's inaugural exhibition - Homecoming - should it open to the public.\n\nIt features works by acclaimed artists such as Yinka Shonibare, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Precious Okoyomon, and Tunji Adeniyi-Jones - many of whom live in the diaspora and have rarely exhibited in Nigeria.\n\nShonibare's Monument to the Restitution of the Mind and Soul has pride of place - a pyramid-shaped unit featuring more than 150 clay replicas of the Benin Bronzes.\n\n\"Creating a monument like this is acknowledging the trauma caused by the looting of those spiritual artefacts,\" he told the BBC. \"It's a deeply emotional engagement with the trauma of the invasion.\"\n\nHe chose clay deliberately, as a metaphor for connection with the land of Benin itself.\n\n\"In the modern world, we seem to have become increasingly distanced from nature, whereas our ancestors had a deep connection and respect for it.\"\n\nThe pyramid evokes Africa's ancient wonders while the replicas speak to absence and memory.\n\n\"The work is conceptual - about the meaning of absence, the spiritual meaning of the bronzes,\" Shonibare explained. \"In a way, the work is cathartic. It is almost mourning.\"\n\nAlso commanding attention is Ndidi Dike's 2016 mixed-media work National Grid, which reflects on power, both electrical and political.\n\nNigerians experience power outages so frequently they have become an accepted part of daily life - a metaphor Dike uses to question the nation's broader failures in governance and infrastructure.\n\nIt is something likely to resonate all too well for those working at Mowaa this week.\n\nThough they may take heart from the words of the culture minister, who is chairing the presidential committee that wants to resolve the dispute.\n\n\"Cultural institutions are pillars of our national identity and must be protected through collaborative approaches that respect both traditional custodianship and modern institutional structures,\" Hannatu Musawa said.\n\nThere are fears the row may damage ongoing efforts to reclaim Africa's stolen art, with Western museums feeling justified about their concerns over the conservation of returned works.\n\nBut many working within the walls of Mowaa remain determined to show that their creativity can redefine what a modern African museum can be - with or without historic artefacts.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41g75pe20o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"00:20:49.092+00:00","title":"Stranger Things cast and creators on show's ending and spin-off plans","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Stranger Things, a globally successful sci-fi horror series set in Hawkins, Indiana, is concluding its five-season run after being a cultural phenomenon since its debut in 2016.

Things cast and creators on show's ending and spin-off plans\n\nAfter five seasons, Stranger Things is coming to an end - but another portal is already opening as the creators behind the show, twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, tell the BBC a spin-off series is already in development.\n\n\"It's early days but we're excited about it,\" says Matt Duffer. \"It's new characters and a new mystery, so it's different, but it will be in the same world as Stranger Things.\"\n\nThe pair feel that there is more to explore, but Matt's twin brother Ross explains they always saw the original story as a self-contained arc and it's definitely \"the end for these characters\".\n\nThe clarity around the ending had always been part of the plan, and Matt says the final scene \"was the one thing we had planned from the start\".\n\n\"We always knew what we were working towards so it was like our north star and we built the whole season around the final scene.\"\n\nSeason five is set in the autumn of 1987. Hawkins, Indiana, is scarred by the opening of the Rifts and the group of friends must find and kill Vecna. At the same time, the town is under military quarantine as the hunt for Eleven intensifies.\n\nThe brothers, who were in their early thirties when the show began, had always planned for four or five seasons, but say it still feels surreal that they managed to get that far.\n\nWhat started as a nostalgic horror about a missing boy in a sleepy town quickly grew into one of Netflix's biggest global hits.\n\n\"When you're making the show, you're so entrenched in it that you forget how far it's come, and every season we put everything we have into it,\" Ross says. \"And when we made season one, we didn't even know if we'd get a second.\"\n\nIt's a feeling the cast shared. Joe Keery, whose character Steve Harrington goes from a high school jock to a heroic mentor-like figure, tells the BBC he remembers saying goodbye to everyone after season one and not being sure if he would see them again.\n\n\"Season one felt like an indie film and now it's this crazy big-budget movie,\" the 33-year-old says in disbelief.\n\nBy the time the final season wrapped, after a year of filming, \"it felt like we'd been working on it forever\".\n\n\"But we had a great time making it and the friendships we made aren't going anywhere. We will still be in each other's lives.\"\n\nNatalia Dyer, who plays Nancy Wheeler, says the friendships they've built off camera mirror those of their on-screen characters.\n\n\"These characters have this shared secret world they all know about and in real life, we have something similar as we're the only people who know the show inside-out.\"\n\nCharlie Heaton, who plays Natalia's on-screen boyfriend Jonathan Byers, agrees and explains that \"the events in the show change these characters' lives forever, and similarly this show has changed our lives forever\".\n\nThere have been reports that not everything has been plain sailing.  The Mail on Sunday recently reported  that Millie Bobby Brown filed a harassment and bullying claim against her co-star David Harbour, but that hasn't been confirmed.\n\nHowever, the cast insist there's a close friendship between everyone, while the Duffer brothers say they felt an immense responsibility to protect the younger cast throughout filming.\n\n\"When we cast them we didn't know the show was going to be what it was and you hear so many horror stories about young people that become famous as the spotlight can be harsh,\" Ross says.\n\n\"I think it helped that there were so many younger cast members so they weren't going through anything alone and could turn to each other during challenging times.\"\n\nThat solidarity was a vital help for Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler and says growing up in the spotlight was a challenge \"because you're going through puberty and a life change like being part of Stranger Things at the same time\".\n\nHis on-screen, and perhaps also off-screen, best friends Caleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo agree, and the trio start laughing about how young they were when they first met.\n\nI ask the young men how they feel about the show ending and stepping into new projects, and Gaten is first to admit they feel some trepidation.\n\n\"I'm a bit shaky and there is a bit of anxiety, but I think that's the point.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old, who plays Dustin Henderson, says now feels like a good time to step into a period of unknown.\n\n\"Your twenties are all about change, transition and growing, and we're incredibly lucky to be in a position to establish consistency in our careers.\n\n\"I see that as a real blessing and I look at it optimistically as I can because it is scary to not have the comfort of knowing there's another Stranger Things season.\"\n\nThe legacy of the show is undeniable - it's transformed a cast of newcomers into stars and spawned a global fanbase who have grown up alongside it.\n\nCaleb hopes that connection lasts and the show \"lives on and becomes one of those things that people will rewatch and never get tired of, like a classic film\".\n\nKnowing the impact of the show made saying goodbye even harder, and the final day of shooting is something Caleb won't forget for a while.\n\n\"Everyone was there and it bought us back to episode one - that feeling of home, being supported and loved, and everyone was on the same page in terms of their connection with the show,\" he says.\n\nNetflix has announced an animated follow-up, while details of the Duffer brothers' live-action spin-off are still under wraps.\n\nIt's the end of an era for the current cast. But would they reunite for another project?\n\n\"Our part of the Stranger Things story is done for now,\" Gaten says. \"But if they called us in a while, who knows?\"\n\nThe first four episodes of season five will be available in the US from 26 November, with the next three arriving on Christmas Day, and the finale on New Year's Eve. In the UK those releases will be a day later."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:01:48.211+00:00","title":"Musalia Mudavadi says over 200 Kenyans fighting for Russia in Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 200 Kenyans are reportedly fighting for Russia in Ukraine, with some former security personnel and a young athlete allegedly tricked into joining the conflict.

longest shutdown in US history\n\nPresident Donald Trump has signed a spending bill to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in US history.\n\nHe signed the short-term budget into law just hours after the House of Representatives voted 222-209 to approve it on Wednesday night, and two days after the Senate narrowly approved the same package.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump said the government would now \"resume normal operations\" after \"people were hurt so badly\" from the 43-day shutdown.\n\nMany government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees have been on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food aid has also been left in limbo and air travel has been disrupted nationwide.\n\nGovernment services are expected to reopen in the coming days, while disruptions to air travel will likely ease ahead of the looming Thanksgiving holiday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had reduced air traffic because of staff shortages owing to the shutdown.\n\nThat had direct impacts on members of Congress attempting to reach the nation’s capital on Wednesday for the House vote.\n\nDerrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican, rode his motorcycle nearly 1,000 miles (1,609km) across the country to cast his vote in the House before it was sent to the president's desk.\n\nThe bill only provides funding to keep the government open until 30 January, when lawmakers will once again need to find a way to fund the government.\n\nBefore he signed it into law, Trump repeatedly cast blame for the shutdown on the Democratic Party. \"They did it purely for political reasons,\" he said.\n\n\"When we come up to midterms and other things, don't forget what they've done to our country,\" he added.\n\nSenate Democrats were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber, because Republicans were still seven short of the 60-vote threshold required to pass a funding bill.\n\nThey initially refused to support the bill, demanding that Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nRepublicans maintained that a healthcare discussion could come after the government was reopened.\n\nBut on Sunday,  a group of eight Senate Democrats broke from the party  and helped pass the spending package. They voted for it in exchange for a promise of a vote on those healthcare subsidies in December.\n\nIt led to fury within the Democratic Party, and public criticism from figures such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the chamber, said the package \"fails to do anything of substance to fix America's healthcare crisis\".\n\nVirginia Senator Tim Kaine was among the group of Democrats who voted in favour of the compromise. He pushed back on that criticism, and said the federal workers he represents were \"saying thank you\" for agreeing the deal.\n\nHours before the House voted to reopen the government, Democrats in Congress watched as their newest lawmaker was sworn into office.\n\nThe addition did not provide enough leverage to impact whether healthcare subsidies were included in the government funding bill, but Democrats welcomed Adelita Grijalva into their ranks with applause on the floor of the chamber.\n\nThe Democratic representative for Arizona was elected on 23 September, but the House has not been in session since 19 September, delaying her swearing in. She is stepping into the seat once held by her father, Raul Grijalva, who died earlier this year.\n\nDemocrats immediately tapped their newest member to back a petition to force a vote on legislation requiring the release of files related to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe petition will need to sit for seven legislative days before it can be called up for floor consideration - and then House leadership will be required to schedule a vote within two legislative days.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson surprised many on Wednesday and said he would schedule a vote for next week.\n\nThe deal negotiated over the weekend extends funding for the federal government until 30 January.\n\nIt also includes full-year funding for the Department of Agriculture, as well as funding for military construction and legislative agencies.\n\nGuarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September are also included in the bill.\n\nThe package includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending the healthcare subsidies which Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

The question is always the same. \"Surely this time the DG has to go?\"\n\nWhatever the arguments over individual crises, we live in a 'hunting for a scalp' media culture.\n\nAnd when it comes to finding Davie's replacement, the words of the BBC chairman Samir Shah have stayed with me.\n\n\"This is not an easy job to fill, it really isn't,\" he told staff on Tuesday. \"And I have to be honest, the way we as a country attack people, really personally, is not good.\n\n\"Why would somebody want to do this job if that's what they face? We're asking a lot of a director general.\"\n\nHe's right - and whoever takes on the job next will know the odds aren't great that they will make it through unscathed. Three of the last five permanent DGs have resigned following scandals.\n\nOne person said to me: \"If that's what it's like, the number of people prepared to do the job won't be many.\"\n\nAlthough all newsrooms make mistakes, when the BBC does, it often results in pressure on its editor-in-chief - the director general.\n\nOne media executive said to me that the volume of output generated by the BBC makes it impossible for the DG to be across it all, but \"inevitably at any one moment somebody is doing something really stupid\". In the end, those mistakes can sink a DG because they have ultimate responsibility.\n\nDavie was paid about £530,000 a year for his trouble - but that is less than he'd have made heading up a big commercial service.\n\nHowever, for the right candidate, it could equally be an enticing moment to join the BBC as it heads into negotiations with the government over its new royal charter, which will determine its future.\n\n\"It's a difficult time to be leading the BBC, but it's also an exciting time,\" says Deadline's international TV editor Max Goldbart, who has been reporting on the corporation's crises this week.\n\n\"The charter renewal is about to happen, criticism is coming from all fronts, but if you're able to push through this then you could be seen as the person who led the BBC through difficult times in the modern streaming era.\"\n\nGoldbart says it is still \"the biggest job in British broadcasting\".\n\n\"It remains an influential position which has a lot of prestige attached to it... although that prestige has probably dropped over the last five years.\"\n\nGoldbart thinks there will be people who are up for the fight.\n\nOf course that's right. But the pool of people with the right combination of skills is actually more of a small puddle.\n\nThe role calls for experience in creative leadership, a tight grip on editorial issues, knowledge of running a large administration, political nous, experience of commercial affairs, and a grasp of the global media perspective.\n\nThere aren't many people (if any) who tick every box - which is why some people feel the job is now too big for one person to take on. There have even been calls for it to be split.\n\nInside the BBC, some are saying there could be one leader in charge of programming and strategy, and a separate editor-in-chief or deputy director general responsible for news and current affairs.\n\nGiving someone else responsibility for news and current affairs, which is where many of the recent BBC scandals originated, could significantly help a director general's chances of survival.\n\nHowever, my sense is that the BBC only works with one person at the very top with final oversight.\n\nOther possible candidates include BBC Studios chief  Tom Fussell,  All3Media CEO  Jane Turton , RTE's director general  Kevin Bakhurst , Sky CEO  Dana Strong  and Channel 4's chief content officer  Ian Katz.\n\nEx-BBC head of news  James Harding , former ITV chairman  Sir Peter Bazalgette , Washington Post CEO  Will Lewis , TV presenter and executive  Sir Trevor Phillips  and broadcaster  Andrew Neil  have also been suggested. BBC presenters  Nick Robinson  and  Amol Rajan  have even been mentioned.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Youngs."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglgj08erywo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:45:53.309+00:00","title":"I can't take any more of this,' Andrew told Epstein, released emails show","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of emails from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee, reveal that Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011: 'I can't take any more of this,' after being alerted to a British newspaper's report alleging sexual encounters between him and Virginia Giuffre.

I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"\n\nThe latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.\n\nDemocratic member of the House Oversight Committee, Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, told BBC Two's Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee.\n\nHe said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\".\n\nVirginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein -  alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager .\n\nAndrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology.\n\nHe  was stripped of all his titles  earlier this month after Giuffre's posthumous memoir threw new focus on Andrew's ties to Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThree emails from the Epstein estate,  released by Democrats on the Congressional House Oversight Committee , indicate that Trump was mentioned several times by Epstein in emails exchanged with Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nThey also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.\n\nOne email from Epstein to Maxwell, sent in April 2011, claims that Trump spent hours at Epstein's house with a person whose name was redacted.\n\nEpstein wrote: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"\n\nThe White House later said the unnamed \"victim\" referenced was Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".\n\nGiuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.\n\nWithin hours, House Republicans then released thousands more documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it had been an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".\n\nHours after the latest publication of emails, the newly-sworn in Democratic Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva signed a petition, meaning it now has sufficient numbers to force a House vote that could require the US Department of Justice to release all the Epstein files.\n\nThe office of House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the House would hold that vote next week.\n\nThe latest files shed further light on the relationship between Andrew and Epstein, with one email appearing to confirm a photograph of Andrew with his arm around a 17-year-old Giuffre was real.\n\nIn an exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein appeared to discuss Giuffre and her photograph with Andrew.\n\n\"Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,\" he wrote.\n\nAndrew said in his 2019 Newsnight interview that he had no recollection of that photo being taken and has suggested it might be fake.\n\nThat exchange came four months after the purported \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March 2011.\n\nThe email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.\n\nOn 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including the now infamous photograph of Andrew and Giuffre.\n\nThe email goes on to say that the masseuse and another girl were directed to sit on Andrew's knee in Epstein's New York flat, and that he groped both girls.\n\nThe email says that one of the girls was directed by Maxwell to have sex with Andrew. It also states she was directed to participate in an orgy with Andrew at Little St James - Epstein's private Caribbean island. It requests a reply by noon the next day.\n\nIt appears that the email is sent to Maxwell by her representative, forwarded on to Epstein and then to a redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".\n\nOn 6 March 2011, the day the Mail on Sunday published its Giuffre story, Epstein emails \"The Duke\", asking: \"You ok?\". He add: \"These stories are complete and utter fantasy\".\n\nIn an email to his publicist in July that year, Epstein writes: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar.\n\n\"I think Buckingham Palace would love it. You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro (sic).\n\n\"I promise you she is a fraud. You and I will be able to go to ascot (sic) for the rest of our lives.\"\n\nLord Mandelson  also appears in the newly released documents , which show he had contact with Epstein as late as 2016.\n\nThe latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.\n\nThe new documents include an email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, saying \"63 years old. You made it\".\n\nLord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".\n\nEpstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.\n\nLord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, after emails showed the peer sent him supportive messages after he pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor in 2008.\n\nLord Mandelson, who has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein,  declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz917nvj7qeo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"09:15:04.269+00:00","title":"Democrats left bruised after historic shutdown yields little","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 43-day government shutdown—the longest in U.S. history—ended with federal workers getting paid, national parks reopening, and services resuming.

historic shutdown yields little\n\nAfter 43 days, the longest US government shutdown in history is coming to an end.\n\nFederal workers will start receiving pay again. National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.\n\nAfter the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?\n\nSenate Democrats, through  their use of the parliamentary filibuster , were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.\n\nThey drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nWhen a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.\n\nSince then, members of the party's left flank have been furious.\n\nThey've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.\n\nEven more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\n\n\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"\n\nNewsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.\n\nIf he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.\n\nFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.\n\nOn Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\n\n\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"\n\nTrump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\n\n\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.\n\nAlthough there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.\n\nWhile his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.\n\nWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.\n\nWhile several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.\n\nDemocrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.\n\nAnd that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on  the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .\n\nLater on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.\n\nIt was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\n\n\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.\n\nIt was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

washing ashore on South Korea's Jeju island\n\nSince September, residents on South Korea's Jeju island have been spotting small packs of what appear to be bags of Chinese tea washed ashore. Upon closer inspection, however, they were found to contain ketamine.\n\nSome 28kg (62 lbs) of the drug, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found on at least eight occasions, police say.\n\nKetamine is used as an anaesthetic in medical procedures, but its recreational use is illegal in South Korea. It can cause severe physical and mental damage, including to the heart and lungs, when misused.\n\nThe Jeju Coast Guard has formed a team to trace possible sea and land routes through which the drugs may have entered the country.\n\nAuthorities have also warned residents not to touch or open any suspicious objects found along the shore, asking them to instead report such discoveries to police.\n\nOn 15 October, a beach cleaner found 20kg of these \"tea bag drugs\" - the largest haul in the last two months - along the coast of Seogwipo in southern Jeju.\n\nEarlier this week, a team of more than 800 soldiers, police officers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb the beaches in Jeju City, along the holiday island's northern coast, Korea JoongAng Daily reported.\n\nInvestigators are now focusing on the possibility that the drugs drifted to Jeju via ocean currents, according to the national daily.\n\nIt quoted the head of the Coast Guard's narcotics unit saying that similar discoveries of \"tea bag drugs\" have been made in Pohang, another city in South Korea, and Tsushima island in Japan.\n\nJeju residents have shown concern over the presence of illicit drugs on their coastlines.\n\n\"I often bring my children to this beach,\" said Kim, a resident who witnessed the large-scale search effort in Jeju City this week.\n\n\"Seeing so many people looking for drugs is terrifying. I shudder to think that children might touch something like that,\" Kim told Korea JoongAng Daily.\n\nAnother resident, Hyun, wants authorities to focus on \"stopping more [drugs] from drifting in\".\n\nYoon Heung-hee, a professor at Hansung University's drug and alcohol addiction department, suggests a larger syndicate may be behind the ketamine packets.\n\nSome syndicates use a \"sea bump\" method to transport narcotics, he said, which involves dropping bundles of drugs equipped with trackers into the ocean for retrieval later.\n\nCriminal groups could have sought to smuggle the drugs across South Korea via Jeju by \"taking advantage of lax inspections at airports and ports\", Prof Yoon told The Hankyoreh, another local newspaper.\n\nAdditional reporting by Suhnwook Lee in Seoul"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv22qjq8eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"23:01:22.448+00:00","title":"Suneung: Blind students sit 13-hour college entry exam in South Korea","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In South Korea, blind students face a uniquely grueling version of the Suneung (College Scholastic Ability Test), which can last up to 13 hours—nearly double the standard duration—due to the conversion of exam materials into braille.

in South Korea\n\nEvery November, South Korea comes to a standstill for its infamous college entrance exam.\n\nShops are shut, flights are delayed to reduce noise, and even the rhythm of the morning commute slows down for the students.\n\nBy late afternoon, most test-takers walk out of school gates, exhaling with relief and embracing the family members waiting outside.\n\nBut not everyone finishes at that hour. Even once darkness has fully settled and night has set in, some students are still in the exam room - finishing close to 10pm.\n\nThey are the blind students, who often spend more than 12 hours taking the longest version of the Suneung.\n\nOn Thursday, more than 550,000 students across the country will sit for the Suneung - an abbreviation for College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in Korean. It is the highest number of applicants in seven years.\n\nThe test not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can affect their job prospects, income, where they will live and even future relationships.\n\nDepending on their subject choices, students answer roughly 200 questions across Korean, mathematics, English, social or natural sciences, an additional foreign language, and Hanja (classical Chinese characters used in Korean).\n\nFor most students, it is an eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams. They begin the Suneung test at 08:40 and finish around 17:40.\n\nBlind students with severe visual impairments, however, are given 1.7 times the standard testing duration.\n\nThis means that if they take the additional foreign language section, the exam can finish as late as 21:48 - nearly 13 hours after it began.\n\nThere is no dinner break; the exam continues straight through.\n\nThe physical bulk of the braille test papers also contributes to the length.\n\nWhen every sentence, symbol and diagram is converted into braille, each test booklet becomes six to nine times thicker than the standard equivalent.\n\nAt Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Han Donghyun is among the students who will take the longest version of the Suneung this year.\n\nLast year, there were 111 blind test-takers nationwide - 99 with low vision and 12 with severe visual impairments like Dong-hyun - according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation.\n\nDong-hyun was born completely blind and cannot distinguish light.\n\nWhen the BBC met him at his school on 7 November, his fingers moved quickly across a braille practice booklet of past exam questions.\n\nWith just a week left before the test, he was focused on managing his stamina and condition. Dong-hyun will take the exam using braille test papers and a screen-reading computer.\n\n\"It's really exhausting because the exam is so long,\" he said. \"But there's no special trick. I just follow my study schedule and try to manage my condition. That's the only way.\"\n\nDong-hyun said the Korean language section is particularly difficult for him.\n\nA standard test booklet for that section is about 16 pages - but the braille version is roughly 100 pages long.\n\nEven with screen-reading software, spoken information disappears as soon as it is heard, unlike text that can be seen and re-read. Dong-hyun has to hold the details in his memory as he goes.\n\nThe mathematics section is no easier.\n\nHe must interpret complex graphs and tables that have been converted into braille, using only his fingertips.\n\nStill, he noted that things are better than they used to be. In the past, students had to do almost all calculations in their heads. But since 2016, blind test-takers have been allowed to use a braille notetaker, known as Hansone.\n\n\"Just like sighted students write out their calculations in pencil, we enter them in braille on the Hansone to follow the steps,\" he said.\n\nAnother student at Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Oh Jeong-won, who will also sit the Suneung this year, said the late afternoon is \"the hardest point\" of the day.\n\n\"Up until lunch, it's manageable,\" he said. \"But around 4 or 5pm, after English and before Korean History, that's when it gets really tough.\n\n\"There's no dinner break,\" he explained. \"We're solving problems during the time we would normally eat, so it feels even more exhausting. Still, I keep going because I know there will be a sense of accomplishment at the end.\"\n\nFor Jeong-won, the fatigue is compounded by the need to stay intensely focused with both his hands and his hearing.\n\n\"When I'm reading the braille with my fingers and also taking in information through audio, it feels much more tiring than it does for sighted students,\" he said.\n\nBut the students say that the length of the exam and the long study hours are not the hardest part. What is most challenging is access to study materials.\n\nPopular textbooks and online lectures that sighted students rely on are often out of reach.\n\nThere are very few braille versions, and converting materials into audio requires having text files - which are difficult to obtain. In many cases, someone has to manually type out entire workbooks to make them usable.\n\nOnline lectures also pose difficulties, as many instructors explain concepts using visual notes, diagrams and graphics on screen, which cannot be followed through audio alone.\n\nOne of the most significant barriers, however, is the delay in receiving braille versions of the state-produced EBS preparation books - a core set of materials closely linked to the national exam.\n\nBecause of this delay, blind students often receive the materials months later than others.\n\n\"Sighted students get their EBS books between January and March and study them for the whole year,\" said Jeong-won. \"We receive the braille files only around August or September, when the exam is just a few months away.\"\n\nDong-hyun shared the same concern.\n\n\"The braille materials weren't completed until less than 90 days before the exam,\" he said. \"I kept wishing the publication process could be faster.\"\n\nThe National Institute of Special Education, which produces the braille version of EBS exam materials, told the BBC that the process takes at least three months for each book because it must follow relevant guidelines.\n\nThe institute added that it is \"making various efforts to ensure that blind students can study without disruption, such as producing and providing the materials in separate volumes.\"\n\nThe Korean Blind Union said it has long raised this issue with authorities, and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding greater accessibility to braille versions of all textbooks.\n\nFor these students, the Suneung is not just a college entrance exam - it's proof of the years they have endured to get where they are.\n\nJeong-won described the exam as \"perseverance.\"\n\n\"There's almost nothing you can do in life without perseverance,\" he said. \"I think this time is a process of training my will.\"\n\nTheir teacher, Kang Seok-ju, watches students go through the exam every year - and said the blind students' endurance is \"remarkable\".\n\n\"Reading braille means tracing raised dots with your fingertips. The constant friction can make their hands quite sore,\" he pointed out. \"But they do it for hours.\"\n\nMr Kang urged his students to value completion rather than regret.\n\n\"This exam is where you pour everything you've learned since the first grade into a single day,\" he said. \"Many students feel disappointed afterwards, but I just want them to leave knowing they did what they could.\n\n\"The exam is not everything.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly90nl202go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:18:39.870+00:00","title":"Treasure finds in England reach record high","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Treasure finds in England have reached a record high of 1,446 in 2024, up from 1,266 in 2023, driven by increased participation from metal detectorists, especially in eastern England such as Norfolk, which had 138 finds.

finds in England have hit a record high, with a lamp shaped like a human foot and an earwax scoop among the more unusual items unearthed.\n\nProvisional government figures recorded by the British Museum's Portable Antiquities Scheme show 1,446 discoveries in England in 2024 - up from 1,266 the previous year.\n\nA treasure find can include multiple items, and eastern England has proved the jewel in the nation's crown, with 388 finds last year.\n\nMany are uncovered by metal detectorists like Emma Youell, who estimates she has found thousands of artefacts and describes herself as a \"massive history nerd\".\n\nEmma says the most valuable part of finding treasure is knowing that recording it contributes to our understanding of history.\n\n\"I found a hammered coin, a silver penny with Henry VIII's portrait in it – so we're going back to the Tudors.\n\n\"I've had gold coins from Iron Age tribes - they're about 2,000 years old.\"\n\nFor the first time, the 2024 finds include two objects that meet a new definition of treasure.\n\nPreviously treasure had to be at least 300 years old and made in part of precious metal such as gold or silver, or part of a hoard.\n\nFrom July 2023, this was expanded to objects at least 200 years old and deemed to be of outstanding historical, archaeological or cultural significance, regardless of what type of metal they are made from.\n\nThe 2024 provisional figures show a further 85 treasure finds in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland, which has  additional restrictions  on searching for archaeological objects.\n\nScotland has a separate law for treasure trove and so its figures have not been included.\n\nThe first under the new definition,  a 9th Century penny , was in England's treasure capital, Norfolk, which had 138 finds in 2024 - the most of any county.\n\nDr Helen Geake, Norfolk finds liaison officer, said the area may be the highest for finds due to being rich with arable fields, historically well-populated and good for collaboration between detectorists and archaeologists.\n\n\"It's the first official coin issued by Aethelstan,\" she said. \"A proper government coin\".\n\nIt was minted by a Viking warlord after he became a Christian king, known as Aethelstan II.\n\nOne picture of the Vikings, she says, is of them \"being raiders and pillagers and attacking monasteries - then they turn into these more peaceful Norse settlers\".\n\n\"This coin sums up the turning point between the frightening Vikings who are attacking us, and the settler Vikings who actually are   us in a strange way.\"\n\nThe second was a Roman copper alloy lamp in the shape of sandaled foot, discovered by a study group in Kent while exploring what is believed to be a small Roman fort.\n\nAccording to the  Portable Antiquities Scheme , it is the first known example of its type to have been found in Britain.\n\nA metal detectorist first saw the chain of the lamp before uncovering the whole thing.\n\n\"It's the most astonishing thing,\" said Dr Geake. \"Roman foot-shaped artefacts appear to have had a number of meanings connected with the cult of Isis. They're also noted as being novelty items.\"\n\nOne of Dr Geake's favourite items is a Roman ear scoop.\n\n\"Apparently they're used to scoop out your earwax, as if your fingernail won't do,\" she said.\n\n\"You're probably looking at it more closely than anybody since the owner who lost it - and it brings you into a weird, otherworldly kind of contact with that owner.\n\n\"It's just a lovely object and when I record objects like this I think 'Gosh, I really do have the best job in the world' - seeing these personal items, looking after them for a bit and giving them a new life.\"\n\nEmma says she has been out detecting nearly every weekend since starting the hobby 12 years ago.\n\nThe 34-year-old from Kent was the youngest in her metal detecting group and one of the only women.\n\nNow, she sees more women and young people get involved and helps run a Facebook group for female detectorists.\n\n\"I've got a camper van so it allows me to get out and around the country,\" she said. \"My husband knows I'm a massive history nerd.

shutdown over, and why did it happen?\n\nThe longest-ever US government shutdown has ended after 43 days.\n\nThe fallout left around 1.4 million federal employees unpaid, suspended food to many low-income Americans and both delayed and cancelled thousands of flights for airline passengers.\n\nHere we unpack your key questions about the historic US funding deadlock.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House on Wednesday - day 43 of the shutdown - approved a new funding bill with a vote of 222 to 209. Six Democrats joined Republicans to vote yes.\n\nThe package passed the Senate two days earlier by a vote of 60-40, after seven Democrats and one independent senator sided with Republicans to approve it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed it into law within hours, declaring, \"It's a great day\".\n\nBut it may still take a few days, or even weeks, to fully reopen the government and restart vital programmes.\n\nAnd with the busy Thanksgiving holiday period looming at the end of the month, it could take a while for airlines to recover from the disruption.\n\nThe busiest airports in the country have been cancelling flights and reducing operations to cope with absence by unpaid air traffic controllers calling in sick.\n\nThe 328-page bill extends money for most federal agencies until 30 January.\n\nIt provides funding for Snap food aid, as well as the Department of Agriculture, Congress and veterans affairs until September next year.\n\nIt guarantees that all federal workers will receive back-pay, and reverses the shutdown-related layoffs of thousands of federal workers.\n\nThe bill does not explicitly include what Democrats most-wanted in this shutdown fight: a guaranteed extension of expiring health insurance subsidies that affect around 24 million Americans.\n\nInstead of including the extension in the continuing resolution bill itself, senators made a deal to hold another on the tax credits at the end of the second week in December.\n\nHealthcare costs are poised to skyrocket for lower income Americans if the subsidies are not renewed.\n\nThe bill includes a number of other provisions, too.\n\nIt contains language that makes it illegal for federal prosecutors to search senators' phone records without notice, and allows for payouts of up to $500,000 for each violation.\n\nThe law is retroactive to 2022, meaning that it will allow several Republican senators to sue after their communications were searched as part of a probe into Trump's role in the Capitol Hill riot in January 2021.\n\nThe spending bill also reverses the legalisation of cannabis-derived hemp, which passed in 2018 as part of a larger farming bill. It's passage allowed the creation of a multi-billion dollar industry of low dosage THC products in the US, including edibles and drinks.\n\nThe new bill provision \"prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products,\" according to a summary provided by the Senate.\n\nAmong its other provisions, the bill bans the Pentagon from increasing spending that was not specifically authorised previously. It also allocates $88m to increase security for Congress, the Supreme Court and the federal court system, due to increased threats of political violence.\n\nIn the US system, both chambers of Congress must approve a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nThe House was able to pass a temporary funding bill to avoid a shutdown, but it could not clear the Senate amid Democratic resistance.\n\nThe Republicans currently control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but at the end of September, senators were seven short of the 60 votes needed to pass a spending bill.\n\nRepublicans hold 53 seats in the chamber and needed Democrats to join them in the vote, giving liberals some negotiating leverage.\n\nThe party's main demand was that the bill should include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.\n\nSo on 1 October, the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential were furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave. Most will be expected to return to work now.\n\nDuring the shutdown, air traffic controllers are also expected to work without pay. But some of them had called in sick, leading to many flights being cancelled or delayed. The federal government even mandated flight cuts to airlines at 40 airports - including the nation's busiest - to help alleviate overworked air controllers and others who had been working without pay.\n\nThose workers will expect to see backpay within days of the government being reopened.\n\nMore than 42 million Americans who rely on Snap food aid benefits have received only partial payments after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold some funding pending further legal hearings. Those funds will now go back to normal as the government reopens.\n\nWhile most federal employees are not paid during a shutdown, members of Congress do continue to receive their salary.\n\nSome federal programmes will take longer to rebound.\n\nLiheap, a heating subsidy programme used by around 6 million low income households, won't be available for weeks, coming just as the winter months are arriving. Head Start, an early childhood education programme, also could take weeks to resume.\n\nNot all areas of the government are impacted by a shutdown.\n\nFederal law enforcement operated as usual, Social Security and Medicare cheques were still distributed, and mail delivered. The Trump administration also tapped into research funds and  accepted money from an anonymous donor  to find money to pay military troops.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still causes problems. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts are suspended.\n\nUnlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once a shutdown ends, and many of them are small businesses without other big clients.\n\nOverall,  analysts had estimated that this shutdown would knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth  for each week that it goes on - about $15bn a week.\n\nShutdowns over budgets  are a unique aspect of US politics .\n\nThe second-longest ever shutdown dragged on for 34 days, beginning in late 2018 during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nBut these legislative standoffs also predate the current president.\n\nThere were eight shutdowns during the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

This move, driven by pressure from political parties and states, aims to improve the accuracy of affirmative action policies by providing better data on who benefits from welfare and quotas. While advocates argue that such data would make policy more targeted and equitable, critics like scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warn that counting castes may reify and harden a deeply discriminatory hierarchy, echoing colonial practices of control and surveillance. He argues that caste is not a system that can be managed through enumeration but must be destroyed. Other scholars, including Sonalde Desai, Satish Deshpande, and Mary E John, emphasize that caste data is essential to understanding both privilege and deprivation, and that the absence of such data has led to blind policymaking. However, challenges remain in data collection, including the complexity of caste subgroups and the risk of misclassifying vulnerable populations.

counting castes in India\n\nCounting castes in India has always been about more than numbers - it is about who gets a share of government benefits and who doesn't.\n\nThe country's next national census, scheduled for 2027, will -  for the first time in nearly a century - count every caste, a  social hierarchy  that has long outlived kingdoms, empires and ideologies.\n\nThe move ends decades of political hesitation and follows pressure from opposition parties and at least  three states  that have already gone ahead with their own surveys. A 2011 survey - neither run nor verified by census authorities or released by the government - recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names.\n\nA full count of castes promises a sharper picture of who truly benefits from affirmative action and who is left behind. Advocates say it could make welfare spending more targeted and help recalibrate quotas in jobs and education with hard evidence.\n\nYet in a provocative new book, The Caste Con Census, scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warns that the exercise may harden the deeply discriminatory caste system, when the need is to dismantle it.\n\nThe argument cuts against the prevailing view that better data will produce fairer policy. For Mr Teltumbde, castes are \"too pernicious to be managed for any progressive purpose\".\n\n\"Caste is, at its core, a hierarchy seeking impulse that defies measurement,\" he writes.\n\nMr Teltumbde sees the modern caste census as a colonial echo.\n\nBritish administrators began counting castes in 1871 as a \"deliberate response to the post-1857 unity of Indians across caste and religion\", turning it into an \"effective tool of imperial control\". They held six caste censuses between 1871 and 1931 - the last full caste enumeration in India.\n\nEach count, Mr Teltumbde argues, \"did not merely record caste, but reified and hardened it\".\n\nIndependent India, in Mr Teltumbde's reading, preserved the system under the moral banner of social justice, \"while effectively evading its core obligation of building the capacities of all people, which is a prerequisite for the success of any genuine social justice policy\".\n\nThe obsession with counting, he says, bureaucratises inequality. By turning caste into a ledger of entitlements and grievances, the census reduces politics to arithmetic - who gets how much - rather than addressing what Mr Teltumbde calls the \"architecture of social injustice\".\n\nHe sees the demand for a caste census as a push for more reservations - a cause driven by an \"upwardly mobile minority\", while the majority slips into deprivation and dependence on state aid. Nearly 800 million Indians, he notes, now rely on free rations.\n\nAffirmative action quotas were first reserved for Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - and Adivasis (tribespeople), India's most oppressed groups. But soon, the less disadvantaged \"other backward classes\" (OBCs) began clamouring for a share of the pie. Politics quickly coalesced around demands for new or bigger caste-based quotas.\n\nMr Teltumbde's deeper worry is that enumeration legitimises what it measures. Political parties, he warns, will exploit the data to redraw quotas or convert caste resentment into electoral capital.\n\nFor Mr Teltumbde, the only rational politics is one of \"annihilation of caste\", not its management - echoing what BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's constitution, argued when he said that caste cannot be reformed, it \"must be destroyed\".\n\nBut in an India where even its victims \"see value in its preservation\", that goal feels utopian, the author admits. The looming caste census, Mr Teltumbde argues, will not expose inequality but entrench it.\n\nMany scholars don't quite agree, seeing the census as a necessary tool for achieving social justice.\n\nSociologist Satish Deshpande and economist Mary E John call the decision not to count castes \"one of independent India's biggest mistakes\".\n\nToday, they note in a  paper , caste has come to be seen as the burden only of India's lower castes - Dalits and Adivasis - who must constantly prove their identity through official labels.\n\nWhat's needed, they write, is \"a fuller, more inclusive picture where everyone must answer the question of their caste\". This isn't an \"endorsement of an unequal system\", they stress, but a recognition that \"there is no caste disprivilege without a corresponding privilege accruing to some other caste\".\n\nIn other words, the lack of reliable caste data obscures both privilege and deprivation.\n\nSociologist and demographer Sonalde Desai told me that without a fresh caste census, India's affirmative action policies operate \"blindly\", relying on outdated colonial data.\n\n\"If surveys and censuses could shape social reality, we would not need social policies. We could simply start asking questions about domestic violence to shame people into refraining from wife-beating. We have not asked any questions in the census about caste since 1931. Has it eliminated caste equations?\" she asks.\n\nPolitical scientist Sudha Pai, however, broadly agrees with Mr Teltumbde's critique that counting castes can solidify identities and distract from deeper inequalities based on \"land, education, power and dignity\".\n\nYet she acknowledges that caste has already been politicised through welfare and electoral strategies, making a caste census inevitable.\n\n\"A caste census would be useful if the income levels within each caste group are collected. The government could then use the data collected to identify within each caste the needs of the truly needy and offer them the required benefits and opportunities, such as education and jobs for upward mobility,\" Dr Pai says.\n\n\"This would require moving away from simply using caste as the parameter for redistribution of available resources, to use of both caste and income levels in policymaking.\"\n\nDr Pai argues that if done \"thoughtfully\" - linking caste data to income and educational indicators - it could shift India from a \"caste-based to a rights-based welfare system\".\n\nYet, scholars warn that counting castes and interpreting the data will be fraught with challenges.\n\n\"It won't be painless. India has changed tremendously in the century since 1931. Castes that were designated as being poor and vulnerable may have moved out of poverty, some new vulnerabilities may have emerged. So if we are to engage in this exercise honestly, it cannot be done without reshuffling the groups that are eligible for benefits,\" says Professor Desai.\n\nAnother challenge lies in data collection - castes have many subgroups, raising questions about the right level of classification. Sub-categorisation aims to divide broader caste groups into smaller ones so the most disadvantaged among them receive a fair share of quotas and benefits.\n\n\"Castes are not made of a single layer. There are many subgroups within a single caste. What level of aggregation should be used? How will the respondents in a census respond to this question? This requires substantial experimentation. I do not believe this has yet been done,\" says Prof Desai.\n\nMr Teltumbde remains unconvinced. He argues that endless enumeration cannot remedy a system built on hierarchy.\n\n\"You will be counting all your life and still not solve the caste problem. So what will be the use of that counting?,\" he wonders. \"I am not against affirmative action, but this is not the way to do it.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly98qp99l8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:00:11.235+00:00","title":"Why Ukraine is bracing for its 'worst winter' of the war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine is preparing for its worst winter of the war due to a coordinated Russian strategy targeting power and gas networks, especially in eastern regions.

Oksana Zinkovska-Boyarska lives with daily power cuts. The lift to her eighth-floor apartment often stops, the lights go out and sometimes the pumps maintaining pressure in the gas central heating fail.\n\nShe has a big rechargeable battery pack to keep appliances going, but it costs €2,000 (£1,770) and it only lasts so long. Her husband Ievgen, a lawyer, often has to work by torchlight. Their two-year-old daughter Katia plays by candlelight too.\n\nAmid air raids and cold darkness, Oksana says she and Ievgen worry constantly for Katia. \"I can't describe with words the animal fear when you take your child to the shelter during the explosions.\n\n\"I have never felt anything like that in my life and I wouldn't want anyone to feel anything like that. The thought that she might be scared because there's no light - this is terrible.\"\n\nAll across Ukraine, families are bracing themselves for even tougher times ahead - a long, cold winter in which Russian President Vladimir Putin attempts to finish off his invasion by striking Ukraine's power supplies and networks.\n\nJust last weekend, a massive drone and missile strike left much of the country for a time without power. Ukrainians are now enduring regular power cuts of up to 16 hours a day.\n\nIn winter, temperatures in Ukraine can plummet as low as -20C. One senior government figure told me they expect the next few months to be brutal.\n\n\"I think it will be the worst winter of our history,\" says the official. \"Russia will destroy our energy, our infrastructure, our heating. All state institutions should be prepared for the worst scenario.\"\n\nMaxim Timchenko, the chief executive of DTEK, a large private energy company in Ukraine, says: \"Based on the intensity of attacks for the past two months, it is clear Russia is aiming for the complete destruction of Ukraine's energy system.\"\n\nBut according to one European envoy, it's not just about people being cold at night or without light - there is more to Russia's strategy.\n\n\"[This] is also about them not getting any bread from the bakery in the morning and not being able to go to work because there is no power for the factory,\" says the envoy.\n\nAs the official puts it: \"The goal of the Russians is to kill our economy.\"\n\nSo how exactly will this strategy play out? And given that almost four years of war have taken their toll, what does it mean for Ukraine's people - and the future of this long, hard war?\n\nOn the front line, the news is bleak. There are growing signs that the key eastern city of Pokrovsk may fall, giving Russian forces a boost in morale and a fresh platform to seize more of the Donetsk region.\n\nAnother issue that could impact morale is a massive corruption scandal affecting the government.\n\nProsecutors have accused ministers and officials of taking kickbacks from contracts to build defensive structures around Ukraine's nuclear plants. Both of the ministers accused deny the allegations. But the risk for President Zelensky is that Ukrainians, many of whom are living in the cold and the dark, may lose trust in the administration.\n\nWhat's more, for now, diplomatic efforts to end the war appear to be on hold.\n\nPlans of a summit between Putin and US President Donald Trump are on the back burner after Moscow refused to budge from its maximalist war aims and the US imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas.\n\n\"There is currently a pause,\" a Kremlin spokesman said this week, \"the situation is stalled.\"\n\nAll the while, European nations squabble over what to do with €180bn (£160bn) in frozen Russian assets. They plan to use the cash to raise a so-called \"repatriation loan\" for Ukraine, repaid only if Russia ever pays reparations after the end of the war.\n\nBut a row over how to share the risk has left Kyiv's coffers looking distinctly bare.\n\nYet it is the energy crisis that is worrying the Ukrainian government most, according to those I spoke to. \"People are tired after four years of the war,\" the official tells me.\n\n\"I am afraid they will be demotivated.\"\n\nWalk the streets of Kyiv and you'll pass a sea of tired faces - people's eyes are red from a lack of sleep, their rest broken by the air raid sirens.\n\n\"I am tired of not sleeping enough,\" says Yana Kolomiets, 31, a casting director from Odesa. \"But... people who fight on the front line are tired [too].\"\n\nA recent scientific study suggested that people are three times more likely to suffer from insomnia in Ukraine than in countries at peace.\n\nIt tracked the sleep patterns of around 100 Ukrainians over six months, and found the insomnia persisted even on quiet nights. (The research was published by Texty, a data journalism website based in Ukraine.)\n\nThere have not been many quiet nights. Russia launched vast numbers of ballistic missiles at Ukraine in October - some 268 in all, the highest monthly total since the full-scale invasion, according to analysis published by the Oboz news site. The same month Russia launched 5,298 Shahed and other bomber drones.\n\nDiplomats suggest there is a geographic focus to Russia's tactics, their strikes deliberately targeting gas and electricity transmission networks in eastern Ukraine, rather than power stations in the west of the country.\n\n\"They are trying to cut Ukraine in two in terms of energy,\" one European envoy says. \"They want anywhere east of the river Dnipro to be cold this winter.\"\n\nThe aim, one government source told me, is to \"instigate an insurrection, so that people go against the government in Kyiv… they are trying to destroy social cohesion.\"\n\nSo concerned is the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs it has already issued a formal warning, saying \"the approaching winter poses new risks for Ukrainians... as intensified attacks on energy networks undermine efforts to maintain warmth in homes, schools and health centres\".\n\nUncertainty over the outcome of the various diplomatic initiatives hasn't helped, either.\n\nAnd yet opinion polls suggest people in Ukraine may in fact be more hopeful, not less.\n\nResearch by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, a pollster, suggested that in October 56% of 1,008 Ukrainians interviewed felt optimistic about the country's future, up from 43% in May.\n\nSasha, a Kyiv-based financier, explains that Ukrainian morale is volatile, swinging wildly between optimism and pessimism.\n\n\"If people talk about an end to the war, they feel hopeful,\" he says. \"But then when the talks fail, they despair.\"\n\nOksana, though, is pragmatic: she says that for all the fears for her daughter, they have no choice but to endure it.\n\n\"I always think it is much worse at the front line,\" she adds. \"There are boys and girls on the front line who suffer much, much more.\n\n\"I understand my child should not be raised in these conditions, because it is not normal in the civilised world. But we can hold on for as long as the front needs it.\"\n\nEarlier this week, thick fog enabled Russian troops to move further into Prokrovsk.\n\nThe news out of the city is bleak with daily reports of Russian advances. If it fell, it would be the first major city seized by Russia since Avdiivka in February 2024.\n\nBut Russian forces would still only be about 25 miles (40km) from where they began their full scale invasion in 2022, land gained at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the Russian high command is throwing so much at Pokrovsk not just because it is tactically significant, but because Putin wants a victory he can \"sell\" diplomatically to the White House.\n\nThe Russians hope to convince President Trump they are making battlefield gains that will put pressure on Kyiv to sue for peace.\n\nVadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's former foreign minister and ambassador in London, said Russia wanted to \"force this feeling among Europe and westerners – as Russian propagandists have done before – that you can't do anything with Russia, you can't defeat Mother Russia.\n\n\"They hope that our partners will force us to lose face and sign the Russian deal, whatever that is.\"\n\nWhen I asked President Zelensky if his people could survive the coming winter at a recent press conference, he was clear about the scale of the challenge.\n\n\"I don't know what winter will be but we have to prepare in any case,\" he answered.\n\n\"We understand what we have to do, we understand what we need and our partners also know from us what, in the case of difficulties, what volume of electricity we have to import.\"\n\nUkraine imports gas from across Europe, including Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. But it also has massive storage facilities which Russia could target.\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Centre, says Ukraine is well placed to protect its energy supply from Russian attacks. \"We are better trained, we know how to act, we have no panic,\" he says.\n\n\"We have an understanding of what to do if something is damaged. It will be complicated, it will be a hard winter, there will be a lot of outages but it will be manageable.\"\n\nUkraine's prime minister is confident. Yulia Svyrydenko said Russia's goal was \"to plunge Ukraine into darkness. Ours is to preserve the light.\"\n\nNonetheless, this may be harder to achieve if Trump focuses on other matters and turns his attention away from Ukraine - likewise if European voters elect governments that are less supportive of Kyiv and cannot wean themselves off Russian energy.\n\nThe danger is that war fatigue will overcome strategic patience.\n\nBut for all the bleak realism of the official government source, even he remains confident. \"This winter is the last opportunity for the Russians to defeat us,\" he said. \"And if we make it to 1 April, we will win the war.\"\n\nI asked one western diplomat why Ukrainians were so unyielding. \"They are just bloody-minded,\" the envoy said, and pointed to Ukraine's long history of withstanding hardship.\n\n\"They say they have survived the Germans, the Poles, the Turks, the Lithuanians and now they can survive the Russians.\"\n\nAnd yet for many in Ukraine, life is going on as usual - or as usual as it can.\n\nAt the Dynamo Stadium in Kyiv, beneath the floodlights, a game of football is being played - Dynamo Kyiv versus Shakhtar Donetsk. It's a rough, partisan game where the hardcore fans, known as ultras, wear masks and chant at their opponents.\n\nOne of the few signs that this is taking place in a city at war is the number of people there: the stadium can seat more than 16,000 people but only 4,300 fans are allowed in, owing to the capacity of the stadium's bomb shelters.\n\nThe fans have come from all parts of society – young and old, families and friends. Servicemen and women are there too, earning applause from the crowds, who part to let them pass through.\n\n\"It's really important to continue to live,\" says Anatoliy Anatolich, the match announcer, a TV and social media host.\n\nIn his view, coming to the football in itself is an act of defiance.\n\n\"[It shows] everyone that we are not going to leave our country in this hard period… We've got to be here when we win.\"\n\nFive minutes before the end of the match, the chanting suddenly stops. The fans put their hands on their hearts and sing the national anthem.\n\nSoon the whole stadium was singing as one; a crowd divided by teams, but united by country.\n\nTop image credit: AFP/Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

About Epstein and Trump\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T19:46:16-05:00\n\nHouse Democrats on Wednesday released several emails that were obtained from the estate of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying they showed that President Trump may have been more aware of Mr. Epstein’s conduct than he has publicly acknowledged.\n\nSoon after, House Republicans released more than 20,000 pages of Mr. Epstein’s documents, including a vast trove of his emails and other messages covering a period of many years.\n\nIn a post on social media, Mr. Trump said the Democrats were bringing up the Epstein “hoax” to deflect from the government shutdown. House Republicans asserted that the emails shared by House Democrats revealed little information.\n\nHere are some of the key emails released Wednesday and what they say about Mr. Epstein and Mr. Trump’s relationship:\n\nImportance: High\n\nGmax [email protected]\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n4/2/2011 7:09:39 PM\n\nI have been thinking about that…\n\nJeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\nto Gmax [email protected]\n\nSat Apr 02 at 14:25:45 2011\n\ni want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump...

The tabloids had recently spotted him out and about, trying to return to his old social circles. Mr. Epstein was sensitive to what was being said about him, emailing with his employees about negative news coverage. Mr. Trump, now a star on his reality television show, “The Apprentice,” was talking publicly about running for president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee said on X that the victim the email exchanged referred to was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was 16 when she was recruited by Mr. Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell while she was working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.\n\nWhen Mr. Epstein sent the email in April 2011, Ms. Giuffre had recently gone public for the first time about her experiences with Mr. Epstein, telling a British tabloid that he had abused her and trafficked her to other men and providing the outlet with a now-famous photo of herself, Prince Andrew and Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Giuffre was asked in a civil case if Mr. Trump had witnessed the sexual abuse of minors in Mr. Epstein’s home, and she said, “I don’t think Donald Trump participated in anything.” A representative for Ms. Giuffre’s family declined to comment.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto jeffrey E.

Mr. Epstein was dealing with fallout from his conduct but was far from the infamous figure he is now.\n\nStill, Mr. Epstein continued to socialize with notable people. Among them was the journalist Michael Wolff, who encouraged Mr. Epstein to speak out about Mr. Trump and went on to write a biography of the president early in his first administration.\n\nDuring a presidential debate on Dec. 15, 2015, Mr. Trump did not field any questions about Mr. Epstein, according to a transcript, despite an assertion about a media appearance that day by Mr. Wolff beforehand.

A series of Miami Herald articles showed that he received lenient treatment from prosecutors years earlier, including from Alexander Acosta, who was Mr. Trump’s labor secretary at the time.\n\nMr. Epstein’s schedules showed he had continued to meet with Mr. Wolff, who has said he sat in on some unreleased recorded interviews that Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, had conducted with Mr. Epstein.\n\nSoon after this email exchange, the Justice Department said it was investigating how Mr. Epstein’s plea deal had been handled.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n10/29/2016 12:21:03 PM\n\nThere's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him.

It was unclear specifically what Mr. Wolff believed Mr. Epstein would say or whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message.\n\nOne theme that has emerged from the emails is how Mr. Wolff appeared to act as an adviser to Mr. Epstein and suggested he speak publicly against Mr. Trump.\n\nIn another email exchange earlier in 2016, Mr. Wolff advised Mr. Epstein to take an “anti-Trump position” as a way to get ahead of the upcoming release of the book “Filthy Rich” about Mr. Epstein’s life and crimes.\n\nImportance: High\n\nto jeffrey E.

Mr. Black replied that Mr. Acosta would be by himself, with “perhaps a trump administration to assist and accompany him.”\n\nThe Epstein deal was brought up during Mr. Acosta’s confirmation hearing. Mr. Acosta defended it, saying it was offered based on the evidence he had at the time. Mr. Acosta was confirmed, but he would resign in 2019, after Mr. Epstein was charged in New York.

Government Reopens as Trump Signs Bill to End Nation’s Longest Shutdown\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T01:36:05-05:00\n\nThe federal government began reopening Wednesday night after President Trump signed into law a spending package that narrowly passed the House, ending the longest shutdown in the nation’s history.\n\n“With my signature, the federal government will now resume normal operations,” Mr. Trump said as he signed the legislation alongside Republican House leadership and business executives.\n\nEarlier, the House voted 222 to 209 on Day 43 of the shutdown and days after eight senators in the Democratic caucus broke their own party’s blockade and joined Republicans in allowing the spending measure to move forward, prompting a bitter backlash in their ranks. It was the first time the House had held a vote in nearly two months, after an extended recess during the shutdown.\n\nSome programs like food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could be restored within hours, while other effects could take longer to unravel.\n\nMr. Trump used the bill signing to attack Democrats for what he called “extortion,” blaming them for harm inflicted on air travel and the loss of paychecks for federal workers. Polling, however, shows most Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown.\n\n“People were hurt so badly,” said Mr. Trump, whose administration fought in court to not fund food stamps, tried to fire thousands of federal workers and threatened to withhold back pay from others during the shutdown.\n\n“I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this,” Mr. Trump added. “When we come up to midterms and other things, don’t forget what they’ve done to our country.”\n\nSix Democrats joined Republicans in approving the bill. Only two Republicans voted against it, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump’s budget office championed it in a statement as devoid of “any of the partisan, ‘poison pill’ provisions demanded by the Democrats.”\n\nThat was a reference to what had been Democrats’ chief demand in the shutdown fight, the extension of federal health care subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. Most congressional Republicans strongly oppose such an extension. And while Mr. Trump had initially shown a flash of interest in brokering a bipartisan deal on the issue, as the shutdown dragged on he made it clear that he had no interest in negotiating.\n\nHis refusal to do so ultimately led a critical group of Democrats in the Senate to conclude that with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed, millions of Americans at risk of losing food assistance and millions more facing air-travel disruptions, it was time to find an off-ramp from the shutdown.\n\nIn the House, the six Democrats who voted to reopen the government were Representatives Adam Gray of California; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington; Jared Golden of Maine; Henry Cuellar of Texas; Tom Suozzi of New York; and Don Davis of North Carolina. All represent swing districts.\n\n“History reminds us that shutdowns never change the outcome, only the cost paid by the American people,” Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said. “Over the last 43 days, the facts did not shift, the votes required did not shift and the path forward did not change.”\n\nThe Democratic defections in the Senate prompted outrage among House Democrats who, like most of their colleagues in the Senate, said their party should have held together firmly against any government funding bill that failed to address health care costs.\n\n“We have federal workers across the country that have been missing paychecks,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said. “We have SNAP recipients, millions of SNAP recipients across the country whose access to food stability was imperiled, and we have to figure out what that was for.”\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez said that the Trump administration had inflicted “cruelty” on the American people during the shutdown, including by trying to halt full federal funding for food stamps.\n\n“We cannot enable this kind of cruelty with our cowardice,” she said.\n\nHaving elevated the health care subsidies as a political issue, Democrats are eager to keep the pressure on Republicans to extend them or face the consequences from voters who polls show overwhelmingly want to see them protected.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said he and other party leaders would file a discharge petition — a procedural maneuver to steer around the leadership and force a bill to the floor — to extend the subsidies for three years. Such a measure is unlikely to pick up much Republican support.\n\n“There are only two ways this fight will end,” Mr. Jeffries said on the House floor. “Either Republicans finally decide to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits this year. Or the American people will throw Republicans out of their jobs next year and end the speakership of Donald J. Trump once and for all.”\n\nThe compromise measure the House approved on Wednesday includes a spending package that would fund the government through January, as well as three separate spending bills to cover programs related to agriculture, military construction, veterans and legislative agencies for most of 2026.\n\nThe package includes a provision that would reverse layoffs of federal workers made during the shutdown and ensure retroactive pay for those who have been furloughed.\n\nAnd it includes a measure that would provide a wide legal avenue for Republican senators whose phone records were seized as part of the investigation by Jack Smith, the former special counsel, into the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to sue the government for at least half a million dollars each.\n\nThat provision was quietly slipped into the spending deal by Senate leaders, and provoked wide, bipartisan ire among House lawmakers who have said they are looking for future avenues to strike it down. If they had sought to take it out of the spending deal, it would have prolonged the shutdown, because any changes the House made would have sent the measure back to the Senate for final approval.\n\nRepresentative Chip Roy of Texas, a conservative Republican who was one of the Biden Department of Justice’s harshest critics, said it was “beside my comprehension that this got put in the bill, and it is why people have such a low opinion of this town.”\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday ahead of the vote that House Republicans would introduce legislation to repeal that provision, and would fast-track the measure for a vote as early as next week.\n\nRobert Jimison and Michael Gold contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/shutdown-travel-snap-backpay.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:42:12-05:00","title":"The Shutdown Is Near an End.

When Will Things Get Back to Normal?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T19:42:12-05:00\n\nThe longest government shutdown in U.S. history is poised to end, but it will take some time for the programs and people who were affected by the six-week funding freeze to recover.\n\nFurloughed federal employees will have to come back to work, including those responsible for processing payments to programs that are dependent on government dollars. Industries like the airline and hospitality sectors, which felt the punch of the government’s spending lapse, might need even more time to regain their footing. And the rest of the economy that felt the domino effect of the shutdown may feel the impact for some time.\n\nHere are some of the ways the United States has to recover from the shutdown, and how long that may take after the government officially reopens.\n\nFederal law requires that federal workers whose paychecks were paused during the shutdown be made whole. In the past, it has taken about a week for unpaid workers to receive back pay, though the Office of Personnel Management said it varies by agency.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said that air traffic controllers will receive the first 70 percent of their back pay within 24 to 48 hours of the shutdown ending, but it is not clear if other parts of the government will be on a similar schedule.\n\nIt is also unclear if some departments will take longer to make workers whole, because of increased vacancies in agency payroll offices as a result of the Trump administration’s downsizing efforts. In the past, the back pay arrived in one check, a lump sum much higher than what employees would have received if they were paid on a normal schedule. Because of that, many will be taxed at a higher rate, an issue they will have to sort out with the Internal Revenue Service during tax season next year.\n\nThough the Trump administration fought efforts to force them to use contingency funds to pay out benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, during the shutdown, a spokeswoman for the White House’s budget office insisted this week that beneficiaries will see their accounts fully restored within hours of the federal government reopening.\n\nAbout one in eight Americans — 42 million people — rely on SNAP benefits for help in purchasing groceries.\n\nIt could take up to two weeks for the 20 Head Start early-childhood programs that were forced to close temporarily during the shutdown to come back online, said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association. Head Start is a crucial lifeline for hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged families and children.\n\nIn recent days, 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico that served more than 9,000 children were closed temporarily because of the shutdown, he said. It is not clear how quickly each program will receive the funds it needs to restart. Many Head Start programs that had federal funding lapses stayed open with an infusion of money from other sources, including states.\n\nRepresentatives of the airline industry have estimated it will take about a week for air travel to return to normal after the shutdown. But to keep to that schedule, a few things need to happen.\n\nThe Transportation Department must find that air traffic controllers are returning to work in large enough numbers that the threat of staffing triggers — forced delays when facilities are understaffed — is minimal.\n\nMr. Duffy then needs to lift mandated flight restrictions at 40 airports, which began last Friday.\n\nOn Wednesday night, as the House voted on legislation to end the shutdown, Mr. Duffy and the F.A.A.’s administrator said the agency would continue restricting 6 percent of flights at those airports until further notice.\n\nBut officials are hoping that operations will recover in time for the Thanksgiving travel rush, which ramps up the weekend before the holiday.\n\nWhile national parks generally stayed open during the shutdown with reduced services, Washington, D.C.’s network of Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo, closed to the public within days of the government closing. Representatives for the museums and zoo did not immediately provide guidance on how long it might take to open their doors to the public once Congress restores the federal government’s funding, but noted that they would put a reopening schedule on their websites.\n\nThe last shutdown may prove to be a guide. On Friday, Jan. 25, 2019, President Trump signed a bill reopening the federal government after a shutdown that lasted over 34 days. The Smithsonian museums and the zoo reopened to the public four days later.\n\nThe government shutdown shuttered the statistical agencies that produce data on employment, inflation, consumer spending and other aspects of the economy, leaving policymakers flying blind at a critical moment for the economy. When the government reopens, that fog will begin to lift, but only gradually. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will probably be able to release job market data from September within a few days of the government reopening. Other reports on September, such as data on retail sales, could also come out relatively quickly.\n\nBut the statistical agencies had to pause new data collection during the shutdown, which means they don’t have any information about what happened in October. Collecting that data will take time, and in some cases may be impossible. The White House recently suggested that it doesn’t expect the labor statistics agency to release a Consumer Price Index report for October, although some private-sector economists argue a report is still possible.\n\nEven when the data is released, some of it may come with an asterisk. Many government statistics are based on surveys of households and businesses; when those surveys are delayed, there is a risk that people won’t accurately remember what they were doing during the relevant period.\n\nBen Casselman and Tony Romm contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/trump-homeless-funding.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"21:27:38-05:00","title":"Trump Administration to Drastically Cut Housing Grants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is proposing a sweeping shift in homelessness policy that would cut permanent housing support by two-thirds and redirect over $3.5 billion in Continuum of Care funds toward short-term, work-based programs and police-led encampment removals.

of patients were put at risk after two of the UK's leading transplant centres continued fitting a heart device - despite knowing of concerns it had a higher mortality rate than its rival product.\n\nConcerns were raised by the NHS about the device in 2018. Of the patients who were subsequently fitted with the mechanical pump, half went on to die within three years.\n\nThe mother of Greg Marshall - one of the patients who received the device after concerns were known and who subsequently died - told us she was \"disgusted and appalled\".\n\nThe BBC has also learned that leading cardiologists at both hospitals were paid consultants for the device's manufacturer. The hospitals were aware of this.\n\nBoth hospitals - the Freeman in Newcastle and Harefield in London - continued to use the pump for years, and questioned the reliability of the data flagged by the NHS. The pump's manufacturer, Medtronic, eventually withdrew it on safety grounds.\n\nPatients with a weakened heart, who may be waiting for a transplant or deemed not suitable for one, can be offered a machine called an LVAD, a Left Ventricular Assist Device. It helps the heart pump blood around the body and, for many patients, this is their only chance of survival until a transplant becomes available.\n\nThe device is implanted into the heart, with an external wire coming out of the body - usually at the abdomen - that connects to a controller and external batteries.\n\nLVADs have been life-savers for decades and, for a number of years, hospitals had a choice of two devices - the HeartWare HVAD, sold by the Irish-American company Medtronic, and the Heartmate III, sold by US manufacturer Abbott.\n\nIn October 2018, NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), which oversees transplants in the UK, conducted a preliminary audit comparing how the two pumps had performed. A more detailed analysis followed in April 2019.\n\nThe results were stark. Of the 119 patients who had received the Medtronic device, 45% - or 54 patients - had died within two years. In contrast, just 15% - 15 out of 97 patients - who were given the Abbott pump had died over the same period. Similarly, the number of complications - such as strokes or needing a new pump - were significantly higher for the Medtronic device. The audit said there were \"no significant differences\" between the types of patients who received each device.\n\nOne of the UK's six transplant centres, the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, did not wait for the NHS analysis. It had picked up on the growing international concerns and had stopped using the Medtronic device in February 2018 \"after considering the results of two randomised controlled trials\", as their clinicians \"considered the Heartmate III as superior\".\n\nHowever, Harefield Hospital continued to solely use the Medtronic device until early 2021, shortly after the manufacturer had issued a safety notice. The Freeman Hospital continued until June 2021, when the manufacturer withdrew it from sale \"in the interest of patient safety\".\n\nThe regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), continued to approve the device for use after the 2019 analysis, though it had not been informed by the NHS of the data's existence.\n\nThroughout this time, patients fitted with the Medtronic device continued to die at a higher rate than those with the Abbott device.\n\nBetween October 2018, when the first set of NHS data was produced, and June 2021, when Medtronic discontinued its pump, the mortality rate of the Medtronic device was two-and-a-half times higher than the Abbott device, figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show.\n\nForty-nine percent of those who received the Medtronic device (39 of 80 patients) in that time died within three years. By comparison, 19% of recipients of the Abbott device (20 of 106 patients) died during the same timeframe.\n\nMedtronic decided to withdraw the device in June 2021 after growing evidence that its pump had a higher frequency of strokes and deaths compared with other devices. It also cited a specific malfunction where pumps would experience a delay or fail to restart after they were stopped.\n\nGreg Marshall was one of the patients fitted with the Medtronic device, unaware of the studies about its effectiveness compared with the rival product. A fit and healthy young man, he had ambitions of joining the Royal Marines but he suffered acute heart failure in 2019.\n\n\"It was a massive shock to us all,\" his mother Tessa Marshall remembers.\n\nBy June of that year, Greg was offered the Medtronic device by the Freeman Hospital, several months after the first set of NHS data was known about.\n\nHis family say they were not presented with the long-term risks associated with the device, though an existing patient was brought in to tell them of its benefits.\n\nGreg agreed to the surgery, but a significant complication in theatre - which the family say was never fully explained to them - led to a stroke. Greg lost movement down the left-hand side of his body, and his speech was significantly impaired.\n\nOver time, his health slowly began to recover, but a year later, in July 2020, the heart device suddenly stopped working. When he tried to restart it, it failed to switch back on.\n\n\"The pump was not pumping, and he just slowly went blue,\" Tessa says.\n\nGreg was rushed to hospital, but the device could not be fixed. He was told he could have it removed, but, terrified of having another stroke, he refused the surgery.\n\nThe broken device remained inside him, switched off, as his heart continued to function for a further three years, during which time he was on a transplant waiting list.\n\nIn September 2023, while in hospital, he unexpectedly went into cardiac arrest. By the time Tessa had reached the Freeman, Greg had died aged 26.\n\nHis family, devastated by his loss, say they want answers.\n\n\"We said 'Look, Greg, this is the only option you've got, you have got to go with it,'\" said Tessa. \"I kick myself now, for not doing any more research.\"\n\nThree patients may have died of this failure, the NHS Trust in Newcastle told the Department of Health and Social Care in a letter seen by the BBC.\n\nThe trust has since told the BBC the issue of the device failing to restart in patients first came to light in December 2020 - five months after Greg encountered the issue - when Medtronic published a safety notice.\n\nHospital documents show Greg's responsible health professional was Prof Stephan Schueler, who until recently was head of the Freeman's cardiothoracic department. Described by a former colleague as \"king of the castle\" in the transplant unit, Prof Schueler had a decade-long relationship with the manufacturer of the Medtronic device, public records show.\n\nGreg's family say he did not declare to them his financial relationship with the heart device's manufacturer, despite such a disclosure being a requirement of the doctor's regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC).\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Prof Schueler said that \"there was never a financial incentive nor any salary arrangements with Medtronic for me or anybody else in our team to choose one device over the other\". He did not respond to a direct question about what he had told Greg Marshall about his relationship with Medtronic but said that he \"always worked within GMC standards for good medical practice\" and that consenting patients for a procedure was \"carried out by a whole team of specialised colleagues\".\n\nIt is common for clinicians to work as consultants for medical manufacturer and pharmaceutical companies. Such arrangements are recognised as being mutually beneficial and can lead to better outcomes for patients, though there are rules around what medics need to declare to patients.\n\nThe Freeman said in a statement to the BBC that it offered its \"sincere condolences\" to Greg's family and it was investigating his case.\n\nIt said that, although it was \"aware\" of the NHS data in April 2019, it felt its scientific value was not reliable, and pointed out that it was not accepted in any national or international scientific publication. It said there were other publications at that time which indicated \"excellent outcomes\" for the Medtronic device.\n\nRobbie Burns, a patient representative with NHS Blood and Transplant, obtained many of the documents relating to the hospitals' continued use of the Medtronic device. He believes there should be an external investigation into how it was allowed to happen.\n\n\"It was entirely preventable,\" he said.\n\n\"If I had been in the position of receiving this [Medtronic] device, and looked back at the data, I would be going, 'Why on earth did you do this?'\"\n\nProf Schueler said the Medtronic device had several benefits, including being more suitable for children and small adults. He said the decision to continue using the pump was taken after internal discussions had considered all the risk and benefits carefully.\n\nAnother doctor, André Simon, the director of heart and lung transplantation and ventricular assist devices at Harefield Hospital, had a similarly long-standing relationship with HeartWare and Medtronic, going back to 2014.\n\nThe man who replaced him at the hospital on the edge of west London, Dr John Dunning, told the BBC that Harefield had continued to use the Medtronic device as \"it was the preference\" of his predecessor.\n\nDr Simon, who no longer works at the hospital, did not respond to the BBC's questions. In its statement, the Harefield said it was \"aware\" of his work for Medtronic and that this had been declared in multiple papers. The hospital added that he was one of a number of senior people \"involved\" in choosing which devices were used, and that \"the continued use of the [Medtronic device] had collective support of clinicians at Harefield\" until the manufacturer issued a safety notice in early 2021.\n\nIn separate statements to the BBC, both the Freeman and Harefield hospitals said their decisions to continue using the Medtronic device were based on \"complex clinical decisions\" and stressed that there were \"no clear grounds\" at the time to believe the Medtronic device was significantly inferior to the Abbott device.\n\nHarefield said it commissioned an external review of its services in 2019 from the then-chair of the NHSBT's Cardiothoracic Advisory Group, and this made no comment on its selection of devices.\n\nIn its statement to the BBC, Medtronic said patient safety was its \"top priority\" and that physicians had been notified in June 2021 about the decision to cease the distribution and sale of its Heartware device. It said it continued to provide support to approximately 1,200 patients currently implanted with the device."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/epstein-emails-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"21:01:30-05:00","title":"After Trump Split, Epstein Said He Could ‘Take Him Down’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A batch of over 20,000 pages of emails and messages from Jeffrey Epstein, released by a congressional committee, reveal that Epstein remained deeply fixated on Donald Trump long after their friendship ended.

Could ‘Take Him Down’\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T21:01:30-05:00\n\nPresident Trump’s long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein came to an apparent end in the mid-2000s. But Mr. Epstein remained intently focused on Mr. Trump for years afterward, seeking to exploit the remnants of their relationship up until his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nIn more than 20,000 pages of Mr. Epstein’s typo-strewn emails and other messages released by a congressional committee on Wednesday, Mr. Epstein insulted Mr. Trump and hinted that he had damaging information on him.\n\nBy turns gossipy, scathing and scheming, the messages show influential people pressing Mr. Epstein for insight into Mr. Trump, and Mr. Epstein casting himself as the ultimate Trump translator, someone who knew him intimately and was “the one able to take him down.”\n\nThe release of the messages instantly pushed the two men’s much-scrutinized relationship back into the public eye, re-energizing Democratic attacks on Mr. Trump and his Justice Department for failing to publicly disclose more information from the investigation of Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe emails date to at least 2011, when Mr. Trump was a reality TV star toying with a long-shot presidential run and Mr. Epstein was trying to rehabilitate his image after his conviction and incarceration for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The messages continue through the spring of 2019, when Mr. Trump was president and his Justice Department was building a criminal case against Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe messages hint that Mr. Epstein or his advisers believed they had inside — and potentially damaging — knowledge of Mr. Trump’s far-flung properties and business dealings. Some suggest that Mr. Epstein thought Mr. Trump knew more about his personal conduct than the president has publicly acknowledged.\n\nThe trove doesn’t appear to include messages from Mr. Trump or anyone purporting to speak on his behalf. The president responded on social media on Wednesday, writing that “the Democrats are using the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax to try and deflect from their massive failures, in particular, their most recent one — THE SHUTDOWN!”\n\nThe emails, the latest batch of Epstein-related documents, were obtained from the Epstein estate in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee. They offer a clear window into his day-to-day communications with friends and associates.\n\nBut they are unlikely to quell the furor around the Trump-Epstein relationship. A core part of Mr. Trump’s base believes the mother lode of documents, audio files and video related to Mr. Epstein are in the possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department. A slice of those documents has been released only in small, curated batches.\n\nThe basic contours of their relationship have long been known. Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were friends in the 1980s and 1990s, attending social events in New York or Florida together. One of Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriends has accused Mr. Trump of groping her, an allegation that Mr. Trump has denied. Mr. Trump has said that he cut ties with Mr. Epstein after his associates recruited teenage girls from Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nBut the new emails show that Mr. Epstein was closely following Mr. Trump’s business decisions and political fortunes.\n\nIn April 2011, Mr. Epstein wrote to his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted of helping orchestrate Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation, that Mr. Trump was the “dog that hasn’t barked.” One of Mr. Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, had recently gone public about her experiences with Mr. Epstein — telling a British tabloid that he had abused her and trafficked her to other men, and providing the outlet with a now famous photo of herself, Prince Andrew and Ms. Maxwell.\n\nImportance: High\n\nGmax [email protected]\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n4/2/2011 7:09:39 PM\n\nI have been thinking about that…\n\nJeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\nto Gmax [email protected]\n\nSat Apr 02 14:25:45 2011\n\ni want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump... VICTIM spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.  police chief. etc.  im 75% there\n\nMr. Epstein’s email said that Ms. Giuffre had “spent hours at my house with him” — Mr. Trump — yet Mr. Trump “has never once been mentioned.” Ms. Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that Mr. Trump never had sex with her or even flirted with her.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Epstein emailed one of his lawyers, Reid Weingarten, and suggested that he get someone to dig into Mr. Trump’s finances, including the mortgage on Mar-a-Lago and a $30 million loan Mr. Epstein said that Mr. Trump had received. Reached on Wednesday, Mr. Weingarten declined to comment, saying he was limited by attorney-client privilege.\n\nAs Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign gained traction in December 2015, Mr. Epstein asked Landon Thomas Jr., then a New York Times reporter, “would you like photso of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen”?\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Epstein actually possessed such photos. Mr. Thomas, who has not worked at The Times since 2019, said Mr. Epstein never provided them. Mr. Epstein also told him about a time when he said Mr. Trump was “so focused” on watching young women in a swimming pool that he bumped into a door, “leaving his nose print on the glass.”\n\nA few months later, in March 2016, Mr. Epstein was bracing for the publication of a book, “Filthy Rich,” that detailed allegations against him. The journalist Michael Wolff, who had a longstanding relationship with Mr. Epstein, told him that he needed to serve up a “counter narrative” to the forthcoming book.\n\n“I believe Trump offers an ideal opportunity,” Mr. Wolff wrote. “It’s a chance to make the story about something other than you.” It is unclear whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message and acted on Mr. Wolff’s advice.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n3/18/2016 3:39:39 PM\n\nA few things to think about:\n\nIf the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience.\n\nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps some social media efforts.\n\nA couple of months later, Mr. Wolff told Mr. Epstein that he would be interviewing Mr. Trump. “Anything you think I should ask?” he wrote.\n\nMr. Epstein replied with a list of “provocative” questions, including about the Trump Shuttle airline, a casino bankruptcy and his debts. “otherwise you can just throw easys,” Mr. Epstein wrote.\n\nMr. Wolff did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Epstein repeatedly insulted Mr. Trump. In a January 2018 email to Mr. Wolff, Mr. Epstein referred to the president as “dopey donald” and “demented donald,” saying that his finances were “all a sham.”\n\nLater that year, Mr. Epstein emailed with Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Harvard University president, about Mr. Trump. Mr. Epstein called him “borderline insane.”\n\nImportance: High\n\nLarry Summers\n\nto J [email protected]\n\n12/22/2018 12:52:50 PM\n\nOf course. Who knows whether I'm serious?

I hope someone close to him gets indicted, but not sure, otherwise the pressure of the unkown will force him to do crazy things.”\n\nMr. Summers declined to comment and referred to previous statements in which he acknowledged “regretting my past associations with Mr. Epstein.”\n\nMany of the messages referring to Mr. Trump are banal. Mr. Epstein’s staff discussed whether Mr. Trump’s arrival at the Palm Beach, Fla., airport would impede the movements of Mr. Epstein’s jet. Friends and advisers frequently sent Mr. Epstein links to news articles about Mr. Trump’s political rise, his policies and investigations into his administration and allies. And associates peppered Mr. Epstein with questions about what Mr. Trump’s presidency might mean for geopolitics and financial markets.\n\n“trump ., is scaring the markets not china,” Mr. Epstein wrote in August 2015 to an unidentified acquaintance who had asked about economic turmoil.\n\nBy late 2018, the authorities were closing in on Mr. Epstein. A series of articles in The Miami Herald showed that Mr. Trump’s labor secretary had signed off on Mr. Epstein’s 2008 plea deal. The Herald series prompted the Justice Department to open a wide-ranging criminal investigation into Mr. Epstein.\n\nThat December, Mr. Epstein was texting with an unidentified acquaintance, who wrote that “they’re really just trying to take down Trump and doing whatever they can to do that…!”\n\n“its wild,” Mr. Epstein replied. “because i am the one able to take him down.”\n\n12/02/18 05:26:08 AM\n\nIt will all blow over!

Mr. Kahn called the form “100 pages of nonsense.” He identified nine “interesting findings” about Mr. Trump’s debts, income and charitable foundation.\n\nIt isn’t clear why Mr. Kahn was digging into Mr. Trump’s finances or whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message.\n\nOver the preceding months, Mr. Kahn had sent Mr. Epstein numerous other emails with links to articles about topics like the investigations Mr. Trump was facing over Russian interference in the 2016 election. A lawyer for Mr. Kahn didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt other points, Mr. Epstein asked acquaintances whether they had information on the lawyers who were representing Mr. Trump. It is unclear why Mr. Epstein was asking.\n\nReporting was contributed by Devlin Barrett, Luke Broadwater, Andrew Chavez, Kirsten Danis, Dylan Freedman, Michael Gold, Matthew Goldstein, Will Houp, Teresa Mondría Terol and Glenn Thrush.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33pygprx7zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"03:12:07.549+00:00","title":"Dua Lipa and Coldplay urge government to 'stop touts from fleecing fans'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 40 prominent musicians, including Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Radiohead, and The Cure, have jointly urged UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to introduce legislation that caps resale prices on live event tickets, in response to widespread complaints about touts exploiting fans.

magazine found that some tickets to see Oasis at Wembley Stadium this summer were listed for as much as £4,442.\n\nAccording to analysis by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), tickets sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.\n\nIn January, the government said it was considering a price cap of up to 30%.\n\nDan Smith from indie-pop group Bastille said \"it seems crazy\" that fans aren't protected from price hikes, when countries like Ireland and Australia have introduced caps on ticket resales.\n\n\"It's not surprising that the idea of a price cap has such widespread support from bands and artists,\" he said.\n\n\"With the support of the government we can all move to a situation where people no longer get ripped off by touts and genuine fans can easily resell unwanted tickets for their original price.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Culture said: \"This government is fully committed to clamping down on touts and is going further to put fans back at the heart of live events.\n\n\"We have carefully considered evidence provided in response to our consultation earlier this year and will set out our plans shortly.\"\n\nThe government's consultation also proposed limiting the number of tickets that resellers can offer.\n\nIn the letter, artists including PJ Harvey, Mark Knopfler, Amy MacDonald, Iron Maiden and Nick Cave joined consumer organisations in urging the government to respond to the consultation \"as soon as possible, and commit to include legislation on a price cap in the next King's Speech\".\n\nThey said the move would \"restore faith in the ticketing system\" and \"help democratise public access to the arts\".\n\nThe letter comes as Which?

also found evidence of speculative selling - when tickets are listed on secondary sites even though the seller has not bought them yet.\n\nWhich? consumer law expert Lisa Webb said the joint statement issued on Thursday \"makes clear that artists, fan organisations and consumers reject the broken ticketing market that has allowed touts to thrive for too long\".\n\nResale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub claim a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media - putting them at increased risk of fraud.\n\nIn football's Premier League, where resales are forbidden because the sport must abide by stricter laws than music events in order to maintain segregation in stadiums,  the BBC recently uncovered  a black market for match tickets, with some exchanging hands for tens of thousands of pounds."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/12/arts/podcast-sets-design.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-03-14","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Advancing Human Rights in Migration: A Call for Global Cooperation","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the ongoing challenges in the asylum and refugee system, particularly in the context of increasing global displacement.

That’s by design.\n\nIn a looped video, a series of podcasters take sips of drinks, nod thoughtfully, and speak into microphones.\n\nOnce upon a special sit-down interview, there was Oprah’s couch, Charlie Rose’s circular wooden table and Larry King’s light-up map and pill-shaped microphones.\n\nIn a looped video, a series of podcasters take sips of drinks, nod thoughtfully, and speak into microphones.\n\nToday, video podcasts are the new talk shows, newscasts and commentary gabfests, where many of the most popular and important public conversations are happening.\n\nIn a looped video, a series of podcasters take sips of drinks, nod thoughtfully, and speak into microphones.\n\nLess fussy than expensive TV productions, these shows favor seemingly tossed-off set designs that must telegraph to the viewer a defined sensibility and the kind of idea exchange they’re hoping to foster.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the tropes of the medium.\n\nIn a close-up video, Joe Rogan squints as he speaks into a black tabletop microphone. He wears black headphones and sits in front of a yellow neon sign spelling out his name.\n\nAs both podcast pioneer and the reigning alpha in this ecosystem of unvarnished Dude Talk, Joe Rogan set a simple template: personalized manly minimalism.\n\nIn a close-up video, Joe Rogan squints as he speaks into a black tabletop microphone. He wears black headphones and sits in front of a yellow neon sign spelling out his name.\n\nEach episode, the host appears in front of an exposed wooden wall and neon-lit logo for “The Joe Rogan Experience” — a nod to his comedy club roots.\n\nIn a close-up video, Joe Rogan squints as he speaks into a black tabletop microphone. He wears black headphones and sits in front of a yellow neon sign spelling out his name.\n\nThe less-than-beautiful but always prominent headphones and mics work functionally, and as a signal to audiences.

He wears black headphones and sits in front of a yellow neon sign spelling out his name.\n\nThey also nod back to the radio days of “The Howard Stern Show,” set in a crammed, dank studio, which aired on TV as a proto-video podcast.\n\nIn a close-up video, Joe Rogan squints as he speaks into a black tabletop microphone. He wears black headphones and sits in front of a yellow neon sign spelling out his name.\n\nThe gear setup works in a less literal sense, too. Andrew Moerdyk of the design firm dots, which worked on the sets for Broadway shows including “Oh, Mary!,” said using viewers’ lingering associations with broadcast news gives “the air of something reported, making opinions feel less like an opinion and more like fact.”\n\nHe added: “It signifies objectivity that maybe isn’t there.”\n\nIn a close-up video, Joe Rogan squints as he speaks into a black tabletop microphone.

That is, after all, the most synergistic form of corporate partnership.\n\nShannon Sharpe, in a black T-shirt and green pants, sits in a leather armchair and throws his head back in laughter.\n\n“Being self-conscious about aesthetic is such a traditionally un-masculine thing, so there is a nuance,” said Moerdyk of dots. “How do you make a space where it’s not unmanly to sit with your dude friends and kiki about your secrets?”\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nPolitical and business podcasts, focused less on interior emotions and more on the outside world, tend toward the antiseptic squareness of cable news.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nOn shows like “The PBD Podcast,” where the conservative entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David discusses current events, guests who lean extreme, like the men’s rights activist Andrew Tate and the white nationalist Nick Fuentes, are lent some sober-minded authority…\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\n… by visual throwbacks to the studio legitimacy of Bill O’Reilly and other cable veterans.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nOn Bet-David’s set, known as the Vault, the host is seen behind a news desk within a former bank, complete with safe deposit boxes that conjure security, secrets and financial success.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nThe “PBD” shelves behind him use patriotic props …\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\n… and arcane political ephemera to express a confident, informed worldview.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nIdeologically slanted shows like the right-leaning “Tucker Carlson Show,” from the former Fox News host, and Tim Pool’s “Timcast IRL” — or the progressive equivalent, “The Meidas Touch” with Ben Meiselas — split the difference between cable TV and casual, work-from-home vlogging.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nThese podcasts often have a generic homeyness that invokes a pirate radio truth-teller giving dispatches from his bunker. The Covid pandemic sped up viewers’ acceptance of this in-between space, Korins said, when many guests and even hosts appeared in their own living rooms, instead of before the standard studio background or in stand-up shots on location.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nThis broad-brush domestic look can overlap with business-minded podcasts like the popular “Diary of a CEO,” hosted by Steven Barlett, with its soft-focus background and vaguely luxe trappings that could be called Airbnb-core, or be said to mirror an upscale co-working space.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nIn these rooms, meant to convey serious credibility on behalf of the host and the guest — and therefore the idealized viewer — the books work not necessarily to flaunt personal connections but to demonstrate a studied intellectualism.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\nThe lighting, too, is more purposeful — even clinical — separating the experts from the philistines.\n\nIn a video, Patrick Ben-Davis, wearing a grey suit jacket and white shirt, rests his head on his left hand and nods in approval.\n\n“It makes me think of the Stephenie Meyer, ‘Twilight’ language trick of writing the protagonist with zero specificity so the reader can insert himself in,” Moerdyk said. “There’s a visual way of doing that, too,” a look that is “generically comfortable but actually totally devoid of personality.”\n\nProduced by Elena Bergeron, Sean Catangui, Tala Safie and Amanda WebsterPhoto and video credits: Harpo Productions/Getty Images (“The Oprah Winfrey Show”); PBS (“Charlie Rose”); CNN, via Everett Collection (“Larry King Live”); “Call Her Daddy;” “The Diary Of A CEO;” “The Joe Rogan Experience;” “The Howard Stern Show;” “This Past Weekend;” “Between Two Ferns;” “The Joe Rogan Experience;” “Call Her Daddy;” “The Oprah Winfrey Show;” “Not This Again;” “Club Shay Shay;” “The Joe Budden Podcast;” “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen;” “Bussin’ With the Boys;” Paramount Pictures, via Everett Collection (“Wayne’s World 2”); “The PBD Podcast;” Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images (“The O'Reilly Factor”); “Tucker Carlson Show,” “Diary of a CEO”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/lindsey-halligan-trump-attorney-court-challenge.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:02:18-05:00","title":"Comey and James Challenge Appointment of Trump Loyalist Prosecuting Them","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia, is set to hear arguments over whether U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, appointed by President Trump, was lawfully installed in her position and whether she had proper authority to secure indictments against two prominent political opponents—former FBI Director James B.

But for Federal Workers, the Anxiety Persists.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:02:05-05:00\n\nJessie Holwell, a Veterans Affairs employee in the Phoenix region who has been furloughed for weeks, said it would take a while for her life to go back to normal.\n\n“The exhaustion, the stress, and the constant uncertainty have taken a toll mentally, emotionally and physically,” said Ms. Holwell, a mother of five.\n\nDuring the 43-day government shutdown, she and her family picked up nightly DoorDash gigs, ran up credit card debt, took out a personal loan from her bank and indefinitely postponed their plans for a sixth child.\n\nHer twins turn 12 this week, and she said they still planned on having a modest birthday celebration and a dressed-down Christmas.\n\n“Even with back pay, we’ll still be starting behind and playing catch-up for a while,” said Ms. Holwell, who was unsure when she would receive her missing paychecks, like many other federal workers.\n\nPresident Trump’s signature on a bill Wednesday approving a short-term funding patch brought an end to the longest shutdown in U.S. history, but the uncertainty for federal workers is far from over. Even as they return to work, they will be contending with the significant personal and professional toll caused by the fiscal impasse.\n\nAfter being sidelined for more than a month, they are bracing for the backlog that awaits them, but can only guess at what has piled up because many have not been able to log into their systems with the government shuttered.\n\nThey are coming back to work for a president who has shown little concern about their financial strains. After months of seeking to drastically cut the size of the work force, Mr. Trump used the shutdown to try to lay off more federal employees — an action facing a legal challenge — and threatened not to provide everyone with back pay, even though he signed a law in 2019 guaranteeing such compensation.\n\nOn top of that, federal workers know that they could be back in the same situation several months from now, since the bill that Mr. Trump signed Wednesday only funds the government through Jan. 30.\n\nAll of which has underscored a pervasive sense that the federal government is not a stable place to work, many said.\n\n“It’s been scary because you don’t know what’s coming down the pike,” said David Bump, a quality review specialist for the Veterans Benefits Administration in Portland, Ore. He worries the administration could lay off more people next year. “That’s just the way it is, because your job, which is already difficult, you’ve got people who don’t care about public service, who are running the show,” he said.\n\nMr. Bump, a national representative for the National Veterans Affairs Council, which is part of the American Federation of Government Employees union, said he expected mistakes were made during the shutdown in issuing veterans’ benefits because no one was reviewing what was going out the door.\n\n“There will be several backlogs when I return — emails, processing updates and, of course, quality reviews,” he said.\n\nEven before the shutdown, federal employees had been juggling piles of additional work after hundreds of thousands of their colleagues left this year, a result of firings, layoffs, pressured resignations and retirements. An unknown number of employees retired during the shutdown as well, meaning there could be even more empty cubicles when they went back to the office.\n\nIan Morgan, a scientist with the National Institutes of Health who researches antibacterial resistance, said in many ways, it has felt as if the government had been shut down since Mr. Trump returned to office in January. Mr. Morgan, a steward with his agency’s union, part of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, said the Trump administration halted research and new experiments months ago: “All that kind of stuff — that’s been going on, really, for the last nine months.”\n\nIt has been a traumatic year for federal workers, said Christine Lizotte, the secretary and treasurer of AFGE’s Local 1164, representing workers at the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe shutdown has been particularly difficult for Social Security employees who work at call service centers, many of whom are on the lower end of the pay scale. As excepted employees, they have been working without pay during the shutdown and struggling to cover the costs of commuting and child care, she and others noted.\n\nDuring a call with agency managers last week, Andy Sriubas, who leads the agency’s vast field operations, acknowledged the difficulties they have been facing. “My heart’s breaking because I hear all this stuff across the country,” said Mr. Sriubas, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The New York Times.\n\nA handful of offices around the country have had to temporarily close because of a lack of staff, the agency said.\n\nSome Social Security workers have had their cars repossessed and their power shut off. At least one was evicted and some have not had been able to buy groceries for 30 days, Ms. Lizotte said, adding, “I don’t think people realize how close people live to the edge.”\n\nEven with the government reopening, she said she still plans to work with other labor unions in Maine to provide Thanksgiving baskets with turkey, stuffing and other holiday staples to 1,675 federal workers in the state.\n\nIn the past, it has taken about a week for federal workers to receive back pay, Ms. Lizotte said. The official guidance from the personnel office states that it will be paid “the earliest date possible after the lapse ends.”\n\nIn previous shutdowns, Ms. Lizotte said, her back pay came as a lump sum, which was taxed at a higher rate than her normal paycheck, and she had to wait for her tax refund to get back the money she was owed.\n\nThe financial squeeze could persist for federal employees, even after the government reopens.\n\nThe shutdown caused food insecurity for many workers. Makeshift food banks popped up at airports around the country to help security screeners and air traffic controllers who could not afford to buy groceries.\n\n“While the rest of America will get to go on, and that will no longer be the headline or the news headline, it’s still real for them,” Nick Daniels, the president of the air traffic controllers union, said of his members on Monday.\n\nSome federal workers supported Democrats’ strategy to hold out for a deal that included an extension of health care subsidies, and were now frustrated that the pain they suffered seemed for naught.\n\nRepresentative Glenn Ivey, Democrat of Maryland, who represents about 65,000 federal workers in the Washington suburbs, said many told him to “hold the line,” even as they waited in a line around the block to go to a food bank.\n\n“They were all saying, ‘keep fighting,’” Mr. Ivey said on Monday. “They recognized, in my view, the magnitude of the moment.”\n\nDemocrats’ success last week in off-year elections around the country signaled to many that the party’s strategy around the shutdown had traction.\n\n“There are people who are willing to suffer, already suffering and already sacrificing, because they recognized how big this moment is and how important this moment is, not just for them, but for the country and for democracy, frankly,” Mr. Ivey said, referring to federal workers.\n\nThe question of how to resolve the crisis divided labor union officials. While AFGE ended up backing the G.O.P. plan to reopen the government at current funding levels, some in the union disagreed.\n\nDeclan Farr, vice president of AFGE’s Local 1110, representing employees with the Environmental Protection Agency, said the deal struck in the Senate was a “capitulation,” and not a compromise.\n\n“I am personally very disappointed in any senator who has allowed the shutdown to drag on this long, only to capitulate now,” he said.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Howell said that even after she got her back pay, she, her husband and her five children would continue to pile into their white Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle and spend a couple hours in the afternoons delivering food for extra cash.\n\n“This whole thing made me feel very vulnerable and helpless,” Ms. Holwell said. And she does not want to feel that level of financial insecurity again.\n\nTara Siegel Bernard and Ariana Drehsler contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/house-vote-epstein-files.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:03:59-05:00","title":"What’s Behind the Coming House Vote on Releasing the Epstein Files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan group of 218 representatives, including Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, successfully filed a discharge petition to force a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on a bill requiring the Justice Department to release within 30 days all materials from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

What’s Behind the Coming House Vote on Releasing the Epstein Files\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:03:59-05:00\n\nAfter it received a 218th signature on Wednesday night, a bipartisan effort to force the House to vote on a measure that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files advanced to the next stage.\n\nWith President Trump and House Republican leaders opposed, proponents had turned to an arcane procedural tactic, known as a discharge petition, which allows them to circumvent House leadership and bring bills onto the floor if a majority of members — 218 of them — sign on.\n\nWhen it became clear that they had succeeded, Speaker Mike Johnson, who had gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid a vote on such a measure, relented on Wednesday night and said he would bring the measure to a vote next week.\n\nHere’s how the process will work.\n\nThe House of Representatives operates by majority rule, but in practice, the speaker and the leaders of the majority party control how and whether bills move to the floor.\n\nNormally, when legislation is introduced, it gets referred to a House committee that is controlled by the majority. That committee is not required to act, and bills opposed by the leadership effectively die at this stage. A discharge petition is supposed to provide an end run around this problem. Its name comes from the act of discharging a bill from committee.\n\nIn this case, Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, were looking to force a vote on a bill that would require the Justice Department to release within 30 days material on its investigation into the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe lawmakers turned to a discharge petition after it became clear that Mr. Johnson would not bring the bill, which the White House has fought to kill, to the floor.\n\nMr. Massie and Mr. Khanna began collecting signatures in September. But their petition was only able to reach the 218-member threshold on Wednesday, when Representative Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, signed it just minutes after she was sworn into office.\n\nOnce 218 members have signed a discharge petition, the signatures are effectively frozen, and none can be removed. Mr. Trump spent the hours before the final signature feverishly lobbying Republican signatories to remove their names, including dispatching the attorney general and F.B.I. director to meet with Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, in the White House Situation Room. None budged.\n\nTypically, once it reaches 218 signatures, a discharge petition must “ripen” for seven legislative days — not calendar days, but the days when the House is in session and conducting legislative business. Then, a member can call up the measure on the floor, and the speaker must schedule it for a vote within the next two days.\n\nMr. Massie said on Wednesday night that he had checked with the House parliamentarian and learned that even if one of the members who signed the petition left Congress or died, their signature would still stand.\n\nThat question was particularly relevant because one signatory, Representative Mikie Sherrill, the New Jersey Democrat who was just elected governor of her state, said she would resign from the House next week, while the measure was expected to be ripening.\n\nBecause of the House’s schedule, which includes a weeklong Thanksgiving break, it initially appeared that the House would not vote on the Epstein measure until the first week of December. But the speaker said he would not wait that long.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Mr. Johnson said that he would speed up the timeline and schedule the Epstein vote next week rather than running down the procedural clock on the discharge petition.\n\nMr. Johnson continues to oppose the bill, arguing that it is unnecessary and that a separate investigation into Mr. Epstein by the House Oversight Committee is a more effective vehicle for transparency. As speaker, he could use procedural maneuvers to try and table the bill, as he did with an unrelated discharge petition earlier this year.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson had said that he would bring the measure to the floor if it got majority support, and his decision to move the vote up suggested he saw no reason to forestall the inevitable.\n\nIf every representative who signed the petition also votes for the Epstein measure, it would pass the House.\n\nIn fact, it is expected to draw even more votes than that. Republican leaders expect that some of their members who did not sign the discharge petition — which many lawmakers frown upon as an act of party disloyalty that undercuts their leaders — are likely to vote for the resolution itself. Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska already told reporters this week that he would support the measure, even though he did not join the effort to force a vote on it.\n\nIf the bill does pass the House, it will then be sent to the Senate, where it faces tough odds.\n\nThe Senate is under no obligation to take up bills sent by the House, and it would take 60 votes to force any action on the floor. Democrats hold 47 seats, and so even if they all backed the measure, they would still need 13 Republicans to buck Mr. Trump’s wishes and join them.\n\nIf the bill were to pass the Senate, it would be sent to the president’s desk, and he would be all but certain to veto it. Even if he did not, the only way to compel cooperation with such a measure would be for the House to enforce it by holding the attorney general in contempt of Congress, an exceedingly unlikely scenario.\n\nRepublicans were hoping to avoid a vote on the Epstein files because they did not want to be put in a politically difficult position. Mr. Trump has exhorted his supporters to move on from the Epstein investigation, and he has in the past several months called Republicans with continued concerns “stupid,” “foolish” and “very bad.”\n\nBut many of Mr. Trump’s right-wing supporters were primed to expect explosive revelations in the Epstein files by Mr. Trump and some of his top allies. They were outraged when the Justice Department closed an investigation on the matter in July without releasing all of its files, and have clamored for more information, flooding their members of Congress with phone calls, emails and social media posts pushing them to fight for more transparency.\n\nRepublicans did not want to find themselves in a political jam as they navigated those competing demands from the constituents who elected them and Mr. Trump, who is the leader of their party and wants to keep the matter closed.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/media/michael-wolff-epstein-trump-emails.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:57:31-05:00","title":"Michael Wolff, Chronicler of Elites, Provided Epstein With Advice on Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that Michael Wolff, a prominent journalist and author known for his book 'Fire and Fury,' advised Jeffrey Epstein on how to manipulate the political narrative surrounding Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign.

Chronicler of Elites, Provided Epstein With Advice on Trump\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T17:57:31-05:00\n\nMichael Wolff, a writer, reporter, columnist, author and would-be mogul, has spent his long career building his profile as an insider with gossip on New York luminaries, while sometimes drawing scrutiny from other journalists.\n\nThat profile expanded on Wednesday: Mr. Wolff, it turns out, has been enough of an insider that he once provided advice to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced sex offender, on how to handle his dealings with Donald J. Trump, who was running for president at the time.\n\nThat revelation emerged from emails between Mr. Wolff and Mr. Epstein released by Washington lawmakers, shedding new light on the relationship between the two.\n\nIn one of the emails, from December 2015, Mr. Wolff said CNN planned to ask Mr. Trump about his relationship with Mr. Epstein, and then counseled Mr. Epstein on next steps.\n\n“I think you should let him hang himself,” Mr. Wolff wrote. “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.”\n\nIn October 2016, Mr. Wolff sent Mr. Epstein an email saying there was an “opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him.” The exchange came late in Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign, and weeks after a recording of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women to an “Access Hollywood” host emerged.\n\nBefore the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Wolff disclosed that he had interviewed Mr. Epstein “periodically” for his 2018 book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” which rocketed to the top of best-seller lists with its depiction of a chaotic White House and key officials criticizing the president.\n\nIn 2019, Mr. Epstein was charged in a federal indictment with sex trafficking of minors; he was subsequently found dead in a cell at a federal detention center in Manhattan. The authorities concluded that he had died by suicide. The case against Mr. Epstein, and the circumstances of his death, fueled years of speculation about his relations with top figures in American politics and business.\n\nGiven the public interest in Mr. Epstein, Mr. Wolff released tapes of his interviews with the convicted sex offender shortly before the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“I would say I had a dozen meetings, maybe a dozen and a half meetings, with various outlets, and everybody was interested — everybody was listening, there were a lot of executives in rooms or on Zoom calls — and then everybody passed,” Mr. Wolff said in an interview with James Surowiecki in The Yale Review.\n\nThe Daily Beast published an exclusive on the tapes.\n\nThe latest revelations speak to a well-established reality of recent decades: Journalists’ communications have a way of coming back to haunt them. WikiLeaks released hacked emails from Democratic operatives in 2016, bringing to light the transactional nature of high-profile Washington reporting. Texts and emails that surfaced in a voting company’s defamation suit against Fox News showed that high-ranking network officials disbelieved misinformation about the 2020 election that appeared on the cable channel.\n\nAlso included in the email release is correspondence between Mr. Epstein and Landon Thomas Jr., a New York Times reporter who left the paper in early 2019. A spokeswoman for The Times said Mr. Thomas had left the company “after editors discovered his failure to abide by our ethical standards.”\n\nMr. Thomas said in an interview on Wednesday that Mr. Epstein had been a “longstanding and very productive source” for him.\n\nIn Mr. Wolff’s case, the freshly released material suggests extraordinary coziness between journalist and source. “This is not his job,” said Edward Wasserman, a professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. “He’s becoming a participant, a player and a shaper of the news he’s going to report on.”\n\nMr. Wolff, 72, did not immediately respond to a requests for comment for this article. In comments to ABC News, he said that he couldn’t remember the specifics of the email exchange but that he had been having discussions with Mr. Epstein about his relationship with Mr. Trump. The goal, he said, was to get Mr. Epstein to go public with his comments about Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd in an Instagram post, Mr. Wolff acknowledged the emails between himself and Mr. Epstein and argued that the story of Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Epstein was “central to our time.” The pre-election release of his Epstein tapes, Mr. Wolff lamented in the post, had “little effect.”\n\nIn October, Mr. Wolff sued Melania Trump, whose counsel had sent Mr. Wolff a letter accusing him of defaming her and threatening legal action for more than $1 billion in damages.\n\n“Mrs. Trump’s claims are made for the purpose of harassing, intimidating, punishing or otherwise maliciously inhibiting Mr. Wolff’s free exercise of speech,” Mr. Wolff’s complaint noted. In his Instagram post on Wednesday, he said he thought his lawsuit would enable him to press both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Trump about Mr. Epstein.\n\nMr. Wolff has written several books on Mr. Trump and published his shorter fare in Vanity Fair, The Hollywood Reporter, New York magazine and other outlets. The often eyebrow-raising details in his reporting have long drawn criticism for his tactics. In a 2004 piece in The New Republic, Michelle Cottle wrote that “the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created — springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events.”\n\nHis “Fire and Fury” book in 2018 found an enormous audience among Mr. Trump’s detractors and fact checkers, who cited a number of errors in his reporting. Though some of the concerns were small, a bigger one emerged as Mr. Wolff made the promotional rounds on television.\n\nOn the HBO show “Real Time With Bill Maher,” Mr. Wolff said Mr. Trump was currently having an extramarital affair. Though he declined to name the paramour, he gave Mr. Maher’s audience a hint, saying the telling passage was toward the end of the book. “Now that I’ve told you, when you hit that paragraph, you’re going to say, ‘Bingo.’”\n\nMr. Wolff appeared to be referring to a portion of the book detailing the relationship between Mr. Trump and Nikki Haley, who was serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Haley denied having an affair with Mr. Trump and called the speculation “disgusting.”\n\nIn a 2019 interview with The Times, Mr. Wolff said: “As a journalist — or as a writer — my obligation is to come as close to the truth as I possibly can. And that’s not as close to someone else’s truth, but the truth as I see it.”\n\nJessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-pokrovsk.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:54:53-05:00","title":"I Watched This Haven From War Turn Into a Besieged Wasteland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article describes the transformation of Pokrovsk, a city in eastern Ukraine, from a functioning urban center into a war-ravaged wasteland due to sustained Russian military advances.

The bishops said they “oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and “pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.”\n\n“We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity,” the statement said. “For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.”\n\nThe bishops, who were often divided by American politics in the Pope Francis era, showed a united front in standing behind Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the United States, who has spoken out for immigrants and urged U.S. bishops to do the same.\n\nThe statement, called a special message, is a rare pastoral document that the bishops can issue only at their annual meeting, in order to address pressing circumstances of the day.\n\nThe last time they issued one was in 2013, in opposition to the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama.\n\nFor months, Catholic bishops have pushed back against the federal actions. Prelates have accompanied migrants to courthouses and protested Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill in Congress. But this action sends a particularly strong message not only to the administration, which includes many high-profile Catholics, but also to the millions of the church’s immigrant families.\n\nThe statement outlined a litany of concerns, which many bishops see as more pastoral than political.\n\n“We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement,” it said. “We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.\n\n“We lament that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status. We are troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship and the special nature of hospitals and schools. We are grieved when we meet parents who fear being detained when taking their children to school and when we try to console family members who have already been separated from their loved ones.”\n\nThe statement overwhelmingly passed, with 216 anonymous votes in favor. Five bishops voted no, and three abstained.\n\nBefore the vote, Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, the newly elected president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the room, “I am strongly in support of it.”\n\nPope Leo expressed a specific desire for the bishops to give a united statement on the issue last month, when Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso hand-delivered some 100 letters to him from immigrants.\n\nAfter a full day of public meetings in Baltimore on Tuesday, bishops huddled privately and discussed what to include in the statement for five hours. Some worried that a statement could create backlash from the White House, on issues like religious worker visas, that the bishops are trying to address.\n\nBut unlike some previous annual gatherings, this year, on this issue, the bishops presented a largely united public front.\n\nCardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, where federal agents have conducted immigration raids for weeks, praised the statement’s near-unanimous support.\n\nOn the floor, he had suggested an amendment to make explicit that the bishops opposed the indiscriminate, mass deportation of people. It was quickly approved.\n\n“This is a time of really reflecting on what’s happening, and to not be afraid to respond to the need to defend the dignity of people,” he said in an interview.\n\nSome prelates, like Bishop Oscar Cantú of San Jose, Calif., wished the statement was even stronger.\n\nBut the amendment from Cardinal Cupich “really gave the document gravitas,” said Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami, who had strongly criticized the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. This summer, he drove there on a Harley-Davidson with the Knights on Bikes, a motorcycle ministry, to pray the rosary at its entrance.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, as the bishops discussed the final amendments to the statement, Bishop José María Garcia-Maldonado came to a microphone on the floor.\n\nAs a new bishop, this was his first bishops conference, he told the room. He asked that the statement speak not only to migrant families but also to immigrant priests like him.\n\n“As a migrant person coming from Mexico to the United States, for me and my whole family, thank you for this,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/alaska-phone-voting-anchorage.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:02:17-05:00","title":"Will People Trust Voting by Phone?

Lots of ballots never get delivered, and plenty more arrive too late to be counted. Local election officials hope that the phone experiment will make it easier to vote, while also keeping their elections secure.\n\n“We have a high transient population — military, oil and gas, fishing, tourism — our people are always on the move,” said Liz Edwards, the election administrator in Anchorage. “And so we’ve been trying to make it even easier for them to vote and make it so you don’t really have an excuse not to vote anymore.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

capturing Pokrovsk, a strategic city in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv faces a cruelly familiar choice. It could pull back, concede defeat and save lives. Or it could fight on, delaying a symbolic and tactical victory for Moscow but risking heavier losses of its own.\n\nIt’s a dilemma that has haunted the Ukrainian military throughout the war, as it has struggled to contain Russian advances. Ukraine chose to hold on amid grinding battles in cities like Bakhmut and Avdiivka, both of which ultimately fell to Moscow. Critics argued that a timely retreat could have saved soldiers, Kyiv’s most precious resource in a war of attrition against a much larger adversary.\n\nUkraine’s argument for holding cities as long as possible is that it forces the Russian Army to expend vast numbers of troops, leaving it weakened in the battles to come. There is also a political element, as the two sides wage a battle of narratives. Kyiv wants to prevent Moscow from claiming successes that could sap morale at home and that the Kremlin could use to persuade the Trump administration that supporting Ukraine is a losing wager.\n\nBut with parts of Pokrovsk under Russian control and an adjacent city, Myrnohrad, facing the threat of encirclement, military analysts and some Ukrainian commanders worry that Kyiv may now be repeating past mistakes by staying weeks or months longer than necessary.\n\n“Ukraine has previously held certain positions and cities for too long after the conditions became unfavorable,” said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, who recently visited the front line.\n\nPokrovsk, with a prewar population of 60,000, would be the largest Ukrainian city to fall since Bakhmut in May 2023. Its capture would give Russia a platform to push north and pursue its stated goal of capturing the Donetsk region, about three-quarters of which it already controls.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the difficult situation around Pokrovsk, saying that Ukrainian forces are badly outnumbered. But he has shown no sign of preparing to order a retreat. Instead, he visited Ukrainian troops near Pokrovsk last week and discussed their needs in defending the area.\n\nIf Ukraine keeps fighting for Pokrovsk, it risks being drawn into protracted urban combat as Russia continues to pour its superior resources into the battle. While Moscow has proved capable of replacing its losses through regular army recruitment campaigns offering sizable payouts, Ukraine has long struggled with troop shortages.\n\nVyacheslav Shevchuk, a drone battalion commander in Ukraine’s 68th Separate Jaeger Brigade, who fights in Pokrovsk, said the Ukrainian military was ill-suited for urban combat. It lacks soldiers to clear enemy positions, he said, and cannot use its drones as efficiently in built-up areas that provide concealment for Russian troops. Ukraine is also vulnerable to Russia’s use of heavy guided bombs to smash its defenses.\n\n“It seems to me that the fate of this city is already decided,” Mr. Shevchuk said. “We must take care of our soldiers and withdraw them in time. I see nothing wrong or shameful in pulling our positions back to more advantageous locations.”\n\nPokrovsk and Myrnohrad have long stood as bulwarks against Russian advances in Donetsk. Moscow’s forces began attacking the cities more than a year ago but were held back by Ukraine’s fortified defenses and extensive use of drones to detect and counter incoming attacks.\n\nStill, repeated assaults wore down Ukrainian defenses, and Russian forces now increasingly rely on small assault groups to slip through undermanned Ukrainian lines undetected. They have also exploited recent poor weather, which hampers Ukrainian reconnaissance drones, to push into the city.\n\nIn a video that circulated widely on social media this week, Russian troops entered Pokrovsk from the south, along a road shrouded in fog. The footage, whose location was verified by The New York Times, showed a ragtag column of soldiers on motorcycles and on top of cars, some missing doors. They drove down the road seemingly unopposed.\n\nWhether Ukraine can pin these troops in street fighting in Pokrovsk for an extended period and bleed Russia’s army remains unclear.\n\nIn Bakhmut, fierce combat raged for months over every street and block, leaving the city in ruins.\n\nThe Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank, said in a report last year that holding Bakhmut made sense initially, as it allowed Kyiv to “inflict disproportionate losses” on Russian forces.\n\nBut after Russians advanced far enough to bring Ukrainian supply routes into the city within reach of their artillery, “the disparity in losses became unfavorable for Ukraine,” the report said. Still, Ukraine’s top command decided to hold on so as not to signal weakness, just as it was trying to secure more military aid from Western partners.\n\nOverall, some 10,000 Ukrainian troops were killed or severely wounded in Bakhmut, while Russia suffered four times as many casualties, the report said. The bulk of the Russian force there were convicted criminals recruited from jails by the Wagner paramilitary group, making it significantly easier for the Kremlin to absorb many deaths without stoking discontent at home.\n\nThe report said the best course for Ukraine “would have been to withdraw to a new defense line.”\n\nBy late 2023, the focus of the war had shifted to Avdiivka, a heavily fortified Ukrainian town south of Bakhmut. Russia is believed to have suffered even more deaths there than in Bakhmut — at least 20,000, according to a statistical analysis, based on Russian court data, by the independent news outlets Mediazona and Meduza.\n\nRussian forces pressed on despite the losses. Unlike in Bakhmut, they did not enter the city frontally but gradually moved to encircle it, trying to force a Ukrainian retreat. Moscow would later use that tactic in other eastern Ukrainian strongholds such as Vuhledar.\n\nUkraine kept its forces in Avdiivka even as the Russian noose drew tighter. As the battle came to a close in February 2024, Ukrainian soldiers had to exit through a corridor roughly a mile wide, under heavy enemy fire. Hundreds may have been captured or gone missing during the chaotic last-minute retreat.\n\nThere is now fear that a similar scenario may unfold in Myrnohrad, just east of Pokrovsk.\n\nBuilding on their advance in Pokrovsk and progress to the north, Russian forces have created pincers around Myrnohrad, leaving a corridor less than two miles wide for troops to exit, according to a map by DeepState, a Ukrainian group monitoring battlefield developments. Bohdan Yanush, a deputy battalion commander in Ukraine’s 79th Air Assault Brigade, said several hundred Ukrainian soldiers were most likely still fighting in the pocket.\n\nMr. Yanush said he was concerned about a possible encirclement, but he and other commanders in the area said there was none for now. Some roads into the city remain usable, soldiers said, and the same fog that helped Russian troops move into Pokrovsk has allowed Ukraine to rotate soldiers into the Myrnohrad pocket.\n\n“Reserves are working, the command is reacting and we see that the line holds,” said Oleksandr Bannikov, a sergeant with Ukraine’s 38th Marine Brigade.\n\nUkrainian soldiers fighting in Myrnohrad said that they had received no orders to retreat, and that they were focused on inflicting as many casualties on attacking Russian troops as they could.\n\nThe question, as in Bakhmut and Avdiivka, is when the attrition balance will turn against Ukraine and whether Kyiv will then decide to concede defeat.\n\nThe relentless Russian assaults have opened gaps along the front that Moscow has exploited to push forward. In recent days, Russian troops have captured half a dozen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region, southwest of Pokrovsk, in an unusually rapid advance.\n\nIf troops are not withdrawn from Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, “we could end up in a situation where there is no one to plug the gap in the front,” Vitaliy Deinega, the founder of Come Back Alive, a major Ukrainian charity that supports the military, wrote on Facebook. In that case, “the fortifications we have dug in our rear will quickly fall into enemy hands,” he said.\n\nAnatoly Kurmanaev, Kim Barker and Arijeta Lajka contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/world/asia/pakistan-trump-lobbying.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:00:21-05:00","title":"How Pakistan’s Spending Blitz Helped Win Over Trump and Flip U.S. Policy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, Pakistan launched a coordinated and substantial lobbying campaign in Washington, spending significantly more than India on contracts with prominent U.S. lobbying firms tied to former Trump administration figures.

high-priced contracts with prominent Washington lobbying firms this spring, just weeks before the White House announced favorable new policies that gave the country one of the world’s more enviable tariff rates and an edge over its archrival, India.\n\nThe policy changes heralded a turnabout in Pakistan’s previously rocky relationship with the Trump administration and have largely been attributed to shrewd diplomacy by Islamabad, which has lavished President Trump with the kind of public accolades and big-ticket business deals he relishes.\n\nBut the lobbying contracts, which totaled millions of dollars and held out the promises of lower tariffs and access to Mr. Trump, suggest an additional reason for Pakistan’s improved standing: a campaign to influence the president, which included employing some of his closest confidants.\n\nIn April and May, as Pakistan ramped up its charm offensive, it spent at least three times as much as India on lobbying in Washington, according to contracts filed with the Department of Justice. As Islamabad rapidly hired lobbyists, including Mr. Trump’s former business partners and bodyguard, its relationship with the United States blossomed and India’s deteriorated.\n\nMany factors may help explain India and Pakistan’s recent divergent trajectories. One is that Pakistan agreed to credit Mr. Trump with ending its military dispute with India in May and to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India refused to do either, arguing that U.S. involvement had nothing to do with the cease-fire. Islamabad also eagerly pitched what became a $500 million mineral extraction agreement and opened its markets to American farm goods.\n\nBut the timeline of events and the speedy U.S. warming toward Pakistan also coincides with the lobbying effort.\n\n“You can sort of look at the dots connecting themselves,” said Michael Kugelman, formerly the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, who added that Pakistan’s lobbying effort was one of several key factors in its turnaround.\n\n“There were lobbyists charged with dealing with the tariff issue, then Pakistan’s tariffs come down,” he added. “There are lobbyists contracted to promote economic cooperation, then you have all this interest from the U.S. in critical minerals and energy.”\n\nOver the course of a turbulent few weeks this spring, as the Trump administration raised tariffs on countries around the world and Pakistan found itself on the brink of war with India, Islamabad entered contracts with six Washington firms for nearly $5 million in eventual retainer fees.\n\nAmong the firms Pakistan hired was Seiden Law LLP, which subcontracted Javelin Advisors, a government relations venture. Javelin’s founders include George Sorial, a longtime Trump Organization executive, and Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s former bodyguard, who served as director of Oval Office operations during the first Trump administration.\n\nA million-dollar contract signed between Pakistan and Seiden Law on April 8 promised “a mutually agreed upon number of meetings to enhance Pakistani-U.S. leadership level engagements at the White House.”\n\nAnother agreement with Javelin was inked on April 24, just two days after militants killed 26 people in a terrorist attack in India-controlled Kashmir, and Pakistan and India found themselves on a path to war.\n\nJust weeks after the contracts were finalized, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, the senior-most leader in Pakistan’s powerful military, arrived in Washington, where he met the Javelin principals.\n\nThe following afternoon, June 18, Field Marshal Munir had a private lunch with Mr. Trump at the White House. It was a remarkable meeting: Pakistani Army chiefs had accompanied civilian leaders to presidential meetings, but there is no record of one meeting on his own with a president at the White House.\n\n“We realized we needed to establish a channel at the most senior level,” Mr. Seiden said. Citing attorney-client privilege, he declined to discuss the details of the sit-down with the field marshal, but in a statement his firm said the Pakistanis credited it with its improved fortunes in Washington.\n\n“Many people were instrumental in this that didn’t involve us,” Javelin Advisors said in a statement to The New York Times. “The Pakistani personnel told us we were instrumental in the progress made with the U.S. government.”\n\nAn official familiar with the discussions said Javelin approached one of the president’s aides to facilitate a meeting, but the lunch was ultimately organized by the National Security Council.\n\nPakistani Embassy officials did not respond to requests for comment about efforts to improve their relationship with the White House.\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that Pakistan has been a “vital partner” in countering “radical Islamic terrorism” since the start of the administration. Mr. Trump’s use of tariffs to “end the conflict between India and Pakistan,” she added, “enhanced the president’s positive relationship with Pakistani leaders.”\n\nBy the fall, Mr. Trump had called Pakistan’s army chief his “favorite field marshal” and the nation’s support for his Gaza peace plan “incredible.” It was a sharp turn for a country that Mr. Trump had said in his first term offered “nothing but lies and deceit.”\n\nOn April 2, President Trump announced a 29 percent tariff on Pakistani goods. Six days later — the same day it hired Seiden Law — Islamabad signed a deal with Orchid Advisors, a lobbying firm, which then subcontracted with the firm Squire Patton Boggs.\n\nThe contract with Orchid promised “direct advocacy efforts with the Trump administration regarding tariffs and trade” and to “reset the diplomatic, military and commercial relationship” between the countries.\n\nSquire has employed the president’s former economic adviser Everett Eissenstat, and his former defense secretary, Mark Esper.\n\nFour months after the contract was signed,   Mr. Trump cut tariffs on Pakistan to 19 percent — one of the lower rates among major Asia economies — and increased India’s rate to 50 percent, in large part over President Trump’s frustration that it was still buying Russian oil.\n\nIn a statement, Squire said it “cannot comment on client engagements without their permission.”\n\nForeign governments paying American lobbyists to influence public officials is nothing new. Since 1938, the Foreign Agents Registration Act has compelled Americans working on behalf of foreign governments to register with the Department of Justice and publicly disclose contracts signed with them.\n\nBut at the same time that Pakistan was ramping up its campaign, the Trump administration was moving to loosen limits on foreign lobbying.Recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi, herself a former lobbyist, disbanded the Justice Department’s Foreign Influence Task Force, which prosecuted cases of influence peddling, and narrowed the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nIndia also hired new lobbyists in the spring, and ramped up its efforts in the summer as it was being outspent in Washington by Pakistan.\n\nIn April, India inked a deal with SHW Partners LLC, run by the longtime Trump adviser Jason Miller, who worked on all three of the president’s campaigns. That contract promised India “strategic counsel” and help building “government relations,” but does not specify particular areas.\n\nAnd in August, India hired Mercury Public Affairs, whose partners include Danielle Alvarez, a former senior adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign, and Bryan Lanza, the former communications director for Mr. Trump’s transition team. Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, was also formerly employed by the firm as a lobbyist.\n\nThe Indian Embassy did not respond to a request to comment.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/world/europe/france-paris-terrorist-attacks-anniversary.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:19:05-05:00","title":"How France Remembers the November 2015 Terrorist Attacks in Paris","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France is commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Nov. 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed over 130 people and injured more than 500, marking the worst such assault in post-World War II history.

France Remembers the November 2015 Terrorist Attacks in Paris\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T02:19:05-05:00\n\nFor Djamel Cheboub, memories of the terrorist attacks in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, are painfully vivid.\n\nHe was at La Belle Équipe, a cafe in the 11th Arrondissement, when men with assault rifles sprayed the terrace with gunfire, killing a friend who was with him. Mr. Cheboub was hospitalized for a year and a half. His right foot was blown away by a bullet and replaced with a prosthesis. His left arm was shattered, and he had to undergo major reconstructive surgery.\n\nBut even as many survivors and families of the victims remember the attacks with agonizing clarity, the country’s collective memory has grown fuzzier.\n\nA series of surveys conducted since 2015 have revealed a sharp decline in the number of people who know the three sites where the attacks occurred: an area outside the national soccer stadium, the Bataclan concert hall, and cafes and restaurants in central Paris. Last year, 31 percent could not identify them, compared with just 3 percent in 2016, when the first survey was conducted.\n\n“After 10 years, people don’t talk about it so much,” Mr. Cheboub said. He is not bitter, but his own mind won’t let him forget. “The memories often come back,” he said. “That will never change.”\n\nFrance is making a significant effort to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which killed more than 130 people and injured more than 500. The coordinated shootings and suicide bombings by Islamic State extremists were the worst assaults in France’s post-World War II history and inflicted lasting damage on the nation.\n\nTwo survivors who later died by suicide have been recognized as official victims.\n\nIn recent weeks, there has been a flurry of books, shows, documentaries, exhibits and events tied to the assault. Paris is dotted with plain blue posters bearing the city’s motto — Latin for “She is rocked by the waves but does not sink” — which became an ode to resistance after Nov. 13.\n\nOn Thursday, a commemorative garden of crisscrossing paths and blocks of granite that symbolize the targeted locations will be officially inaugurated in central Paris. A museum to memorialize a number of terror attacks in France is expected to open in the coming years.\n\nGradually, though, a disconnect has grown between those who experienced the horror of the attacks firsthand, and a majority of French people for whom Nov. 13 has become like a chapter in a history book. Important, but distant.\n\nDenis Peschanski, a historian who is coleading a 12-year, multidisciplinary research program to study how the attacks were remembered, spoke of a “dual phenomenon”: a decade later, people remember Nov. 13 more than any other terrorist attack in France, though their memories of key details has waned.\n\nMr. Peschanski said that memories of Nov. 13 have persisted far more than those of other terrorist incidents in France, like the January 2015 attacks in Paris, or the 2016 Bastille Day massacre in Nice. It remains the Islamic State’s deadliest and most elaborate plot in Europe, and the 10-month trial, when 20 men were convicted in 2022, received intense media coverage.\n\nOne survey last year found that more than 80 percent still remembered where they were when the Nov. 13 attacks happened. And the fact that they were perpetrated by children of immigrants who grew up in France and Belgium has fueled anti-immigrant sentiment. The attacks also exposed intelligence failures and led to sweeping antiterrorism laws that critics have called overreaching.\n\nYet the details have slipped from many people’s minds. For some, the Bataclan — where 90 people were killed — has become shorthand for the attacks as a whole, which pains victims from other sites, Mr. Peschanski noted.\n\n“The brain is always efficient, whether for individuals, groups or society as a whole,” he said. “We remember what is sufficient to explain an event.”\n\nFor some victims, the feeling that their experience is becoming a historical footnote was initially difficult to process.\n\n“I did struggle in the beginning with people not remembering,” said Mandy Palmucci, an American who was at La Belle Équipe with some friends by chance because their table at a nearby restaurant was not ready.\n\nMs. Palmucci was not struck in the attack but nearly everyone around her was shot or killed. She has returned to Paris every year for commemorations, and said that she only feels stronger after years of therapy. “I’m a lot more forgiving when people forget about it, or forget that there were restaurants hit,” she said. Still, she added, “there’s a hierarchy in that night of what people experienced and of memory when it comes to the terrorist attacks.”\n\nFor others, it is expected — necessary, perhaps — that society should move on.\n\n“There comes a point where you have to let go of the thing that obsesses you,” said Arthur Dénouveaux, the president of Life for Paris, a victim support association that will officially disband on Thursday after the 10th-anniversary commemorations.\n\nLike many, Mr. Dénouveaux was shaken by the death by suicide last year of Fred Dewilde, a Bataclan survivor who had explored his pain through graphic novels.\n\n“I hadn’t considered before Fred’s suicide whether it is possible to heal from trauma if society itself is still traumatized,” he said, an ever-present question in a country where soldiers patrolling the streets are a reminder that the terror threat is still high.\n\nOne of the main studies in the Nov. 13 memory research program, which was inspired partly by similar work in the United States after Sept. 11, 2001, has been collecting and analyzing thousands of hours of testimony from more than 900 people. They include survivors, families of victims, residents of the targeted areas, other Parisians and inhabitants of other French cities, who are questioned every few years.\n\nAnother study, using a smaller sample size of 200 volunteers, aims to better understand the brains of those suffering from post-traumatic stress, why some victims developed such disorders but others did not and how intrusive memories can be mitigated.\n\n“Ten years ago, in France, we knew very little about post-traumatic stress syndrome,” said Francis Eustache, a neuropsychologist who led the research program with Mr. Peschanski.\n\nFor Mr. Cheboub, the survivor of the attack on La Belle Équipe, healing has come only gradually.\n\nAfter the attacks, local authorities in Paris helped him move into a handicapped-equipped apartment; a few years later, he and his partner had a baby girl; and after several trips to Iceland, Mr. Cheboub, a former clothing designer, started a business there renting glass-roofed cottages to look at the northern lights.\n\n“It’s like a therapy when you see the immensity of nature, you feel smaller and you can rationalize it all,” he said. “I thought by doing this project, it could also be healing for others.”\n\nBut Mr. Cheboub has not told his 7-year-old daughter what happened to him. For many survivors, sharing their memories of the attacks with loved ones is the hardest experience of all.\n\n“I don’t want her to grow up thinking ‘Papa was there, and that could happen to me too,’” Mr. Cheboub said. “I will wait to tell her when she is old enough to understand.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/in-explaining-his-gaffe-heritage-foundation-leader-pleads-ignorance.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:03:30-05:00","title":"In Explaining His Gaffe, Heritage Foundation Leader Pleads Ignorance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin D.

Roberts is the president of the Heritage Foundation, a powerful think tank at the center of conservative politics. He makes more than $800,000 a year. He manages a budget of $100 million. He has a doctorate in history.\n\nNow, he is trying to escape a gaffe that could derail his career. So he is asking allies to believe something at odds with his sophisticated credentials: He erred out of ignorance, because he does not follow current events.\n\n“I actually don’t have time to consume a lot of news,” Mr. Roberts told staff members at the Heritage Foundation last week. “I consume a lot of sports.”\n\nA few days before that, Mr. Roberts had appeared to throw the full weight of the Heritage Foundation onto one side of a bitter conservative family fight over the rise of the white nationalist Nick Fuentes. After the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson conducted a friendly interview with Mr. Fuentes, Mr. Roberts posted a video on social media that defended Mr. Carlson and called his critics “the globalist class” and a “venomous coalition.”\n\nMr. Roberts, who quickly faced blowback within his own organization, apologized and sought to shift blame. He said the words he read aloud in the video had been written by an aide, who has since resigned.\n\n“I didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy,” he said in the staff meeting, according to a video posted online by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet. “I still don’t.”\n\nThat has not satisfied Mr. Roberts’s critics, who wanted him to delete the video and make a more forceful denunciation of Mr. Fuentes’s racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Some of them, in fact, saw Mr. Roberts’s excuse as a new kind of insult — asking them to believe the implausible.\n\n“Who could believe that the head of a think tank doesn’t think?” said Charles Jacobs, the president of the Jewish Leadership Project, which resigned from a Heritage Foundation task force meant to fight antisemitism after Mr. Roberts’s video was released.\n\n“If it’s true, he’s incompetent, and he should leave for that reason,” Mr. Jacobs said. “And if it’s not true, he’s a liar.”\n\nThis controversy has thrown a new spotlight on Mr. Roberts, who took over the Heritage Foundation in 2021 and has recently remade the 52-year-old institution in Mr. Trump’s image.\n\nMr. Roberts has also appeared to remake himself, from the affable leader of a Catholic college into an activist who uses the ominous language of the far right. Last year, for instance, he said in a podcast interview: “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.”\n\nSome conservatives have said he has shirked the responsibility that comes with leading a venerable Republican institution.\n\n“Playing these games, refusing to confront radicals, represents an abdication,” wrote Oren Cass, a conservative economist who previously contributed to the Heritage Foundation’s policy blueprint called Project 2025.\n\nIn an essay posted on Sunday, Mr. Cass criticized Mr. Roberts for claiming to be like the clueless fictional news anchor Ron Burgundy, who would read anything that came across the teleprompter. “He must have mentally processed the words he was speaking,” Mr. Cass wrote.\n\nMr. Roberts declined to comment, as did the board of trustees, which ultimately controls Mr. Roberts’s fate. Instead, the foundation provided a statement from its chief advancement officer, Andrew Olivastro.\n\n“Dr. Roberts has long been a target of these attacks because of his unwavering fight to save our Republic,” Mr. Olivastro said. “Under his leadership, Heritage has grown more successful by almost every measure.”\n\nTax filings show that, under Mr. Roberts, the group’s staff has grown while its revenue has stayed roughly flat. In 2023, the filings show, the foundation ran a $6.7 million deficit after years of large surpluses.\n\nMr. Roberts, 51, was born in Lafayette, La., an oil town that fell into an economic slump when he was young. In interviews, he has said his parents divorced when he was 4. Mr. Roberts became an outstanding high-school debater, enamored by the conservative ideas of the right-wing figure Pat Buchanan, who was a fierce critic of Israel’s influence on U.S. politics.\n\nMr. Roberts received a doctorate in history from the University of Texas at Austin, diving into primary-source documents to write a dissertation on how the composition of enslaved people in Louisiana evolved in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nIn 2013, he found a job that blended academia and conservative activism, as president of the tiny Wyoming Catholic College. Mr. Roberts built a national media presence off the school’s fiercely independent “Cowboy Catholic” personality. The school drew attention both for its strict morality rules — couples were permitted hand-holding and “an occasional hug” — and for its rejection of federal student aid and the outside oversight that came with it.\n\n“It allows us to practice our Catholic faith without qualifying it,” Mr. Roberts told a New York Times reporter in 2015.\n\nAfter three years in Wyoming, he joined the Texas Public Policy Foundation, an Austin-based think tank that helped push the already red state further to the right — calling for lower property taxes, championing charter schools and questioning the science of climate change. Mr. Roberts eventually became the group’s chief executive for about seven months in 2021.\n\nBut in a state capital full of big personalities, Mr. Roberts was overshadowed by others, particularly Brooke Rollins, a charismatic activist who had led the organization from 2003 to 2018. Ms. Rollins later joined the first Trump administration, and is now secretary of agriculture.\n\n“I always thought of him as the follow-on,” said James Henson, who leads a project on Texas politics at the University of Texas. “She was the real engine for building T.P.P.F.”\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Roberts joined the Heritage Foundation, which had four times the budget of the Texas think tank but was mired in questions about its direction.\n\nHeritage calls itself the country’s “most influential policy organization,” and it had more than 400 staff members dedicated to mapping out conservative ideas and lobbying for their adoption. But it had repeatedly changed to remain in the Republican mainstream, adapting to policy shifts from Reaganism to the Tea Party.\n\nThe organization helped staff the first Trump administration, seeking to steer it toward more traditional Republican policies. But it was out of sync with the policies that animated Mr. Trump while he was out of power. And it had competition. Newer pro-Trump think tanks — including one led by Ms. Rollins — were wooing the same donors.\n\nIn 2023, the Heritage Foundation invited a Trump rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, to address its gala, but not Mr. Trump — considered a public snub by Mr. Trump’s inner circle.\n\nOnce Mr. Trump brushed aside Mr. DeSantis and took control of the 2024 Republican primary, the Heritage Foundation scrambled to get itself in line with Mr. Trump’s views. Mr. Roberts spoke about knowing “what time it is in America,” casting Mr. Trump’s ideas as the movement’s future.\n\nHe adopted Mr. Trump’s attacks on the legitimacy of the 2020 election, which have been repeatedly found to be baseless.\n\n“Do you believe that President Biden won the 2020 election?” he was asked by a Times reporter in early 2024.\n\n“No,” Mr. Roberts said. But he conceded that he did not have proof that Mr. Biden’s win was fraudulent. “Is it possible he won? Sure. But can I say definitively that he won? No,” he said.\n\nThe culmination of Heritage’s turn toward Trumpism was Project 2025, in which Heritage oversaw and financed the compilation of a nearly 900-page plan for Mr. Trump’s second term. It echoed some of Mr. Trump’s priorities, like the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, the end of the Department of Education and the erosion of the Justice Department’s independence. But it also contained ideas out of step with Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, like a call to outlaw pornography.\n\nAfter shifting the group’s politics, Mr. Roberts began to change his own public personality. In July 2024, when he made the “remain bloodless” comment, an uproar over the remark provoked a backlash from Mr. Trump and those close to him.\n\nDemocrats used Project 2025 to attack Mr. Trump during his 2024 campaign, and Mr. Trump sought to disavow it. Mr. Trump’s aides issued a statement indicating they believed the Heritage Foundation was improperly speaking for Mr. Trump, saying the project’s demise “would be greatly welcomed.”\n\nHeritage responded by firing one of Mr. Roberts’s subordinates: Paul Dans, who had overseen Project 2025’s director. The group told a conservative news outlet that Mr. Dans had been pushed out for “abusive and demeaning behavior” toward colleagues and shared documents showing he had demanded $3.1 million in severance. Mr. Dans felt he was scapegoated.\n\n“The Heritage Foundation continues to trash my good name and professional reputation for their benefit,” Mr. Dans said at the time. He has since announced his candidacy for a Senate seat in South Carolina, and settled his differences with the Heritage Foundation. “Kevin Roberts is a patriot,” he said in an interview last week.\n\nMr. Roberts survived that controversy, though Heritage seemed to have lost its place as the unquestioned leader of conservative policy thinking. Some rivals run by those closer to Mr. Trump zoomed upward, though their budgets are still far smaller than the Heritage Foundation’s.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump won a second term, he did adopt many of Project 2025’s ideas. Mr. Roberts showcased his connections to the new administration by releasing a book with a foreword written by Vice President JD Vance. (Mr. Vance has not spoken publicly about him since his video defending Mr. Carlson, and declined a request for comment from The Times).\n\nThen, Mr. Roberts jumped into the debate about Mr. Fuentes.\n\nMr. Fuentes leads a movement of so-called groypers, who oppose diversity and immigration and believe the United States was better off when Christian white men were in charge. On Oct. 27, Mr. Carlson posted an amicable interview he conducted with Mr. Fuentes, who said that “organized Jewry” undermined American cohesion.\n\nThe interview has been condemned by Republicans including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Mr. Roberts posted his video jumping to Mr. Carlson’s defense. Jewish Republicans objected not only to his support for Mr. Carlson, but also to the language he used to describe Mr. Carlson’s critics, like “globalist,” which could be seen as a coded reference to Jews.\n\nIn his meeting with staff, Mr. Roberts said those remarks had been written by his chief of staff, Ryan Neuhaus. “When the script was presented to me, I understood from our former colleague that it was approved,” he said.\n\nMr. Neuhaus was reassigned after Mr. Robert’s video defending Mr. Carlson was posted, and then left the foundation, the organization said. Mr. Neuhaus declined to comment.\n\nIn Mr. Roberts’s meeting with Heritage Foundation staff last week, Amy Swearer, a senior legal fellow, accused him of a “master class in cowardice” for dodging blame for the video. She used his own words against him.\n\n“Those are not the actions of a man who knows what time it is,” Ms. Swearer said, according to the video. “Frankly, I’m not even sure they’re the actions of a man who knows how to tell time.”\n\nJulie Tate contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/arts/television/late-night-trump-epstein-emails.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"02:57:58-05:00","title":"Late Night Pops Off on Trump Popping Up in Epstein Email Thread","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Wednesday, House Democrats released private emails from Jeffrey Epstein that allegedly state President Donald Trump 'knew about the girls,' sparking widespread media and political reaction.

James and Maurene Comey\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:03:37-05:00\n\nThe government of North Korea practices “kin punishment,” which means that the state penalizes those who commit political offenses and their relatives as well. With at least one prominent family, the Trump administration has apparently adopted a similar model.\n\nIn a pretrial hearing scheduled for Thursday in Alexandria, Va., James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, will challenge the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the federal prosecutor who signed his indictment in September. Mr. Comey is the first former senior official to face criminal prosecution by the Trump administration, but the case against him turns on the application of well-established legal principles. Are the charges vindictive? Does the indictment clearly specify criminal acts? Did Mr. Comey, in fact, give false testimony? The outcome of the prosecution will resonate widely, but only Mr. Comey will experience the consequences of the verdict.\n\nMaurene Comey, his eldest daughter, was fired July 16 by the Justice Department from her position as a career federal prosecutor, and she, in turn, sued to get her job back. Pretrial proceedings in her civil case are now underway in the same New York courthouse where Ms. Comey used to represent the government.\n\nBoth cases are potential landmarks in the history of American justice, but the legal precedent established by the daughter’s case may turn out to be far more consequential than the finding in her father’s. The resolution of Ms. Comey’s challenge to her dismissal could affect the legal rights of nearly all federal employees.\n\nMs. Comey’s claim is straightforward. She spent a decade as an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. In that role, she enjoyed the protections of the federal Civil Service, which has been in existence for more than a century.\n\nAccording to the latest version of the law, passed in 1978, employees are entitled to “fair and equitable treatment … without regard to political affiliation … and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights,” and personnel actions (including firings) must be based on merit and fitness, and must not be arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. According to her legal claim, Ms. Comey was fired in violation of these provisions.\n\nHer lawsuit is a nearly perfect test case, because she had an impeccable record as a prosecutor. Through her decade of service, she received consistently “outstanding” performance reviews, and she was promoted to leadership positions within the Southern District office. She handled some of the department’s highest-profile cases, including the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, for sex trafficking, before his suicide and she later successfully prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell. Shortly before she was fired, she was part of the team that won only a partial conviction of Sean “Diddy” Combs for various sex-related offenses. Ms. Comey has maintained that there was never any allegation, much less proof, offered to her that her performance was deficient.\n\nSo why was she fired? Throughout 2025, Ms. Comey was a target of Laura Loomer, the right-wing social media influencer whose public denunciations of several members of the Trump administration, including Gen. Timothy Haugh, director of the National Security Agency, led to their dismissals. Ms. Loomer has positioned herself as the president’s protector and uses her presence on social media to lead the charge against those she accuses of insufficient loyalty to the commander in chief. Ms. Loomer called for Ms. Comey to be fired as a “national security risk” because of her “proximity to a criminal,” that is, her father.\n\nThe formal notice of Ms. Comey’s dismissal, which came in a brief email from a Justice Department official in Washington, gave no reason for her termination. Rather, she was told only that she was being fired “pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution,” the provision that defines the powers of the president. Those brief words — and notably what the firing message omitted — reveal the legal stakes of Ms. Comey’s lawsuit.\n\nThe president has the absolute right to fire political appointees, like cabinet members and other senior officials in his administration. But the vast majority of federal employees, including line prosecutors like Ms. Comey, have been protected by the Civil Service rules, and that’s what the Justice Department didn’t address in the email informing her of her dismissal.\n\n“Ms. Comey has a very good case that she was fired in violation of the Civil Service act, which says you have to be fired for cause, and they have stated no cause for firing her,” said Richard Pierce Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, who is an authority on Civil Service law.\n\nCivil Service has deep roots in American government. “The fight over the ‘spoils system’ defined American politics in the late 19th century,” said Daniel Carpenter, a professor of government at Harvard. “When Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, defeated Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, in 1888, the first thing Harrison did was fire 40,000 postal workers so he could replace them with Republicans. The entire system was inefficient and corrupt.”\n\nThe Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was intended to establish job qualification, rather than political affiliation, as the primary criterion for federal employment, but the law wasn’t widely carried out until the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, in the Progressive Era heyday of the early 20th century. “The idea was to move most federal jobs to a merit system, and to outlaw politically based firings by a new administration in town,” Professor Carpenter said. With various tweaks, as in the 1978 law, the Civil Service remained largely politically untouchable, until now.\n\nJudicial recognition of presidents’ constitutional right to fire federal employees without giving a reason, and in plain violation of Civil Service rules, would be an enormous expansion of executive power. That’s what President Trump has attempted to do in a number of areas, including tariffs, immigration and war powers — all according to a theory of constitutional law known as the unitary executive.\n\nIn this term, the Supreme Court will be testing the limits of this theory when it considers whether Mr. Trump has the right to fire the leaders of purportedly independent agencies, like the Federal Reserve, before the end of their fixed terms. Ms. Comey’s case raises a further question about the extension of executive power: whether the president can also fire — for any reason or no reason — hundreds of thousands of other federal employees.\n\nThere’s already one sign of the priority that Mr. Trump assigns to his claim that he can fire any federal employee. The leading academic spokesperson for the idea that the Constitution gives the president nearly unfettered authority over the federal work force was a law professor at Catholic University of America named Jennifer Mascott, and Mr. Trump rewarded her for her views with a nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. She was confirmed by the Senate last month. Neither Comeys’ case will be appealed to the Third Circuit, but the elevation of such a prominent voice for presidential power over federal employment may reverberate throughout the federal judiciary.\n\nThanks to Civil Service laws, most federal employees were able to believe that they served outside the churn of electoral politics and that their work would continue seamlessly from one administration to the next. That insulation from partisan upheaval is often a major attraction for people like Ms. Comey, who was aptly described by her lawyers as “an exemplary, dedicated and highly decorated public servant.”\n\nThe greatest risk of putting the tenure of all federal employees at the whim of the president is not that he will fire them all; it’s that people like Ms. Comey will not seek out the work in the first place.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The wind howled, raking the pitch. A mammoth storm had descended on the Faroe Islands but the players just wiped their faces and kept going, running drill after drill under the misty floodlights. In just a few days, they will play the game of their lives for a chance to etch their tiny archipelago into soccer history.\n\nThis is the Faroe Islands men’s national soccer team, and it is the biggest underdog story in the qualifying stages of the World Cup.\n\nThe Faroes have only 55,000 people. The climate is brutal. Most of the players are not full-time professionals and they have never gotten this close.\n\nBut the Faroes team, whose roster includes carpenters, electricians, a C.E.O. and a car salesman, is on a three-game winning streak and has performed shockingly well against much higher-ranked opponents. On Friday, the Faroe Islands have a do-or-die match against Croatia, an international powerhouse. If they somehow win or even draw, they will keep alive their chances of becoming one of the smallest territories ever to play in the World Cup.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of the Faroe Islands, you’re not alone.\n\nThey’re an archipelago of 18 hilly islands between Scotland and Iceland in the North Atlantic and a self-governing  part of the Kingdom of Denmark with even more autonomy than, say, Scotland’s relationship to the United Kingdom. The Faroes were settled by Vikings centuries ago and according to the team’s members, that’s where they get their grit.\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nThe New York Times\n\n“Everything we’ve done has been against the odds,” said Eydun Klakstein, the head coach. “It’s been against the elements, against the wind, because, you know, this is not the perfect place to build a society.”\n\n“Our ancestors lost men on the seas and women in labor,” the coach went on, in what was quickly turning into an off-the-field pep talk.\n\n“But despite all these circumstances, we built one of the richest, safest, nicest societies in the world,” the coach said. “Everything we do is against the odds, and this isn’t just a question of football. It’s a question of a country. It’s a question of a people. It’s a question of: We have to, we must.”\n\nIt’s not easy building a competitive soccer program here. The Faroes are one of Europe’s soggiest places; it rains about 270 days a year.\n\nIt’s so windy, barely any trees grow, and the long bushy grass has a battered look. The other day, the wind was gusting at 45 miles per hour, enough to shake cars on the road. Still, when it came time for soccer practice, everybody showed up.\n\nThere’s no full-size indoor soccer fields, so in winter, when it’s icy and snowy, the team can’t play much. Most players have to work other jobs, and often it’s hard work. A decade ago, one of its most promising young stars was crushed to death on a dock by a load of fish.\n\nWith just days to go before the big Croatia match, Rene Shaki Jensen, a Faroese midfielder and an electrician, was on his knees drilling holes in a garage. Sometimes, he says, they play an away game in Europe and the next day he’s up on a roof, in the wind and the rain, stringing up wires.\n\nIt’s not ideal, he said, “but I don’t complain.”\n\nContrast that with the eating-sleeping-playing routine of most professional soccer players, many of whom are millionaires. Croatia’s national team, for instance, is stocked with athletes who play in Europe’s top leagues, and its captain, Luka Modric, is a living legend, considered one of the best midfielders of his generation.\n\nWhat’s it like to step onto a field and play against someone like that?\n\n“It’s very cool — the first couple of seconds,” said Hallur Hansson, a carpenter who is a centerpiece of the Faroes team but out with a knee injury. “But then you realize how good they are and you just can’t follow that level, and it’s more frustrating than cool.”\n\nThe Faroese players are stars within their own little universe. Everyone on these islands seems to know one another, and when the players drop in at the bakery or the lumber shop, they are instantly spotted.\n\nBeing from a small place has its advantages — many members of the World Cup squad have been playing together since they were boys. They communicate almost instinctively and cover for each other. Their defense is especially tight.\n\n“It’s difficult to crack them open,” said Tomislav Pacak, the spokesman for the Croatian Football Federation, speaking on the phone from Zagreb about the upcoming game.\n\nHe had only praise for the team, calling it “a tough, organized team that knows how to play together.”\n\n“Let me put it like this,” Mr. Pacak concluded. “The Faroe Islands aren’t going to win the World Cup. But they’re not going to beat themselves.”\n\nThe squad’s success comes as conversations about independence from Denmark intensify. In harbor towns and on old sheep farms, there’s a strong sense of what it means to be Faroese. They have their own language (which is close to Icelandic); their own flag; their own national dress; and their own cuisine (fermented meat is a specialty).\n\nAnd they are geographically much closer to Scotland and Iceland than Denmark, which is fighting to keep its realm together as President Trump eyes Greenland, the other overseas Danish territory.\n\nThe half-dozen Faroese players interviewed were much more comfortable talking about corner kicks than politics. But all said they were pro-independence. FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, allows the Faroes to compete as a separate nation, just as it does for Palestine, Scotland and, for that matter, England. The Faroese players are fully aware that a World Cup appearance would be a major boost for their independence dreams.\n\nBut they’re going to need a string of miracles for that to happen, starting with the next game. Croatia considers itself a small place, too — 4 million people. But it fields one of the world’s best teams.\n\nThey placed third in the previous World Cup and second in the one before that. Miraculously, when the Faroes faced Croatia in September, the Faroes held them to one goal and narrowly lost.\n\nBut that game was played on the squall-magnet of a pitch in Torshavn, the Faroes’ capital, which is their forte. This time, they must travel to Croatia and take on the heavyweights at home.\n\nFor them to advance, the other leading team in their group, the Czech Republic, will have to lose or draw in its next game against Gibraltar. But Gibraltar is considered one of Europe’s weakest teams, and the Czechs stomped them earlier this year, 4-0.\n\nEven if the Faroes’ team wins and the Czechs lose, the Faroes will still need to pull off more upsets in an additional knockout stage to get a place in the cup, which will be held next summer in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe players know there’s a rough road ahead.\n\nBut the coach’s message is simple.\n\n“We have a small chance,” he said. “But we have a chance.”\n\nTariq Panja contributed reporting from London, and Regin Winther Poulsen from the Faroe Islands.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/style/michelle-obama-the-look.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:02:38-05:00","title":"Michelle Obama’s New Book Is a Historical Document Dressed Up as a Coffee-Table Tome","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michelle Obama’s new book, 'The Look', is a historically significant work that documents how fashion became a deliberate instrument of diplomacy and cultural representation during her time as first lady.

It is a glossy photo book full of fashion. It is the story of the expectations that were heaped upon the first Black first lady. And it is the third installment of a trilogy of books by Mrs. Obama that focus on self-realization, including her memoir, her advice book on overcoming adversity and, this time, a meditation on the power of clothes.\n\nBut most of all it is a historical document, capturing a pivotal moment in the evolution of the role of first lady when clothing became an even bigger part of communication. When, in other words, dress became an officially recognized part of the job. That’s a bigger deal than it might appear.\n\nMrs. Obama was, after all, the first first lady to have a stylist — or “valet,” as Meredith Koop was called — on the East Wing payroll, one employed to help define the visual strategy of the first lady for every occasion, from public hula hooping to major moments of pageantry.\n\nBefore the Obamas entered the White House, first ladies like Jacqueline Kennedy, Nancy Reagan and Hillary Clinton may have worked with a designer on their dresses for inaugural balls or state dinners, but the relationship was more grace and favor than structural. It was more about pageantry and propriety than diplomacy, and the first ladies tended to choose one designer (Oleg Cassini, James Galanos, Oscar de la Renta) and stick with him.\n\nAfter Mrs. Obama, however, Melania Trump and Jill Biden each employed a stylist — Hervé Pierre for Mrs. Trump and Bailey Moon for Dr. Biden — who served as a liaison between fashion brands and the East Wing. They worked with many designers, for pretty much every occasion, often with a specific set of political priorities in mind. A new template had been created, and it became the norm.\n\nWhy that happened is, in large part, the subtext of “The Look,” which was released by Crown last week, and it is why the book matters. It lays bare, in an unprecedented (and easy-to-read) way, how a wardrobe was transformed into a vehicle of soft political power.\n\nIn some ways, it was unavoidable.\n\nAs the first Black first lady, Mrs. Obama knew that her every move was sure to be scrutinized, including every outfit. She had to represent all sides of a fractious country, and she had to do it as the first first lady of the social media age. The ability of the world to see and track her every appearance was far greater than it had ever been, and the ability of the world to comment on her every appearance was also greater. Her image — the pictures making their way around Instagram and Twitter and Facebook — mattered in a way it never had before, and thus the choices involved with creating that image mattered. The stakes had changed when it came to clothes.\n\nAs Mrs. Obama admits in the book. There had been speculation about the purpose behind many of her fashion choices as first lady in a number of books, including “Everyday Icon” by Kate Betts and “Michelle Obama: First Lady of Fashion and Style” by Susan Swimmer (not to mention in numerous articles by critics like me). But this is the first time she has overtly addressed the subject of her style and credited the team — Ms. Koop, the stylist; the hairdressers Yene Damtew, Njeri Radway and Johnny Wright; the makeup artist Carl Ray — that helped make it happen.\n\nThus, she writes, the decision to choose Jason Wu, then a young, relatively unknown Taiwanese-born New York designer, to design her inaugural gown was about demonstrating “that I was going to champion people and voices and talents that were too often overlooked.”\n\nOnes who, she went on, “represented the diverse talent of American fashion design that I wanted to showcase to the world.”\n\nThus the approximately 100 different looks from Mrs. Obama’s time as first lady memorialized in “The Look,” not counting what she wore during the campaigns or after the Obamas left the White House. That’s a lot of clothing for one woman to wear, or shop for, in only eight years.\n\nEspecially when the criteria for each look being chosen also included diplomatic outreach, as when Mrs. Obama turned to a designer whose background bridged the United States and one of its allies for a state dinner or visit — all the better to, as she writes, “pay respect.” (See, for example, the dress by Tom Ford, an American designer working in London, that she wore during her state visit to Britain; or the gown by Versace, the Italian brand, she wore for the Italy state dinner.)\n\nEspecially when there were also practical concerns to take into consideration — not just the mores of different countries, but the fact that Mrs. Obama’s clothes couldn’t restrict her movement, had to allow her to hug someone if desired and had to be invulnerable to makeup that might rub off during contact.\n\nThough Mrs. Obama writes about all of that in “The Look,” as well as the often racist criticism she received for wearing sleeveless dresses, one subject she avoids is cost. She does note that she tried to introduce “affordable but fashionable brands into my closet,” including J. Crew, but there’s no avoiding the fact that acquiring this many outfits is an enormous expense — a burden borne by the first family, not the state. One of the ways this cost is managed is for a designer to “gift” an outfit for a major public event to the country, which means that while the first lady may wear a gown once or twice, it goes into the national archive or a presidential library rather than her closet.\n\nStill, that doesn’t change the takeaway of “The Look.” Just how much Mrs. Obama adapted her own style to the style she felt the country needed became obvious once she left the White House, with her subsequent book tours and related fashion experiments. A Canadian tuxedo! Thigh-high Balenciaga boots! Straight-from-the-runway Chanel!\n\nAnd that further underscores the point of this book: For any first lady selecting the (many) garments that will define her tenure is not something that happens by accident. Nor should it be: It’s work.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/opinion/trump-elections-virginia-new-york.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:03:54-05:00","title":"Welcome to the Washington Demolition Derby","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the political fallout from the U.S. government shutdown, focusing on Democratic infighting over ending the shutdown without preserving Affordable Care Act subsidies, and highlights the growing scrutiny of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

2025-11-13T05:03:54-05:00\n\nBret Stephens: Hi, Frank. The Senate finally voted on Monday to reopen the government, and the House just agreed to do the same. So what — other than dividing their own caucus and canceling a lot of flights and terrifying people on food stamps and (with their entirely predictable capitulation) infuriating their base — did the Democrats accomplish with the shutdown?\n\nFrank Bruni: Here’s what Democrats accomplished, Bret: They exceeded my expectations when it comes to their talent for self-injury. After last week’s elections, the party was riding high, and the big political stories were President Trump on the ropes and ugly MAGA infighting over Nick Fuentes. Now we have ugly Democratic infighting over an end to the shutdown without any continuation of Affordable Care Act subsidies. By either not being able to hold ranks or not making sure at the start that Democrats were all on the same page, the party has snatched discord from the jaws of victory. Impressive stuff, don’t you think?\n\nBret: Reminds me of the great Will Rogers line: “I don’t belong to any organized political faith. I am a Democrat.” But maybe the party will catch a break if the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosures manage to stick to the president — though I tend to doubt they will.\n\nFrank: Whether they stick or not, the “Epstein files” will dominate the news again for a while. And with Mike Johnson, the House speaker, now forced to swear in Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of New Mexico, the House members who have been pressing for a vote about the release of all of the files seem to have the support they need to make that vote happen. Republicans are in a real bind: They don’t want to defy and infuriate Trump, but they also don’t want to open themselves up to the accusation that he and they are keeping secrets from the public. Good times.\n\nBret: The only way any of this sticks, politically, is smoking-gun, red-letter evidence that Trump had a sexual relationship with one of Epstein’s victims. Otherwise, it doesn’t do much but provide fodder for a few manic hours on MSNBC. Democrats need to focus a lot less on Epstein and start worrying a lot more about winning over normal voters with better ideas about governance.\n\nFrank: Just to round out the record, plenty of Republicans have been as or more obsessive about Epstein — or at least about the files. I point you to Representatives Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, for just two examples.\n\nBret: Well, to my point: It’s an obsession for fringe politicians. We should be thinking instead about making politics work again. Are you at least relieved that John Thune, the Senate majority leader, resisted Trump’s pressure to reopen the government by ending the filibuster?\n\nFrank: I am. Very much so. But I feel more than relief. I feel hope — a little, precious seedling of it. There’s a growing number of examples of Republicans pushing back at Trump and at the ugliest parts of MAGA. The fever isn’t exactly breaking, but maybe its temperature has dropped a quarter degree? I just won’t attribute that to Tylenol.\n\nBret: Yep — thank God congressional Republicans refused to throw away their institutional prerogatives simply to appease the whim of a demolitionist president. Democrats should think twice whenever they have a majority again and are tempted to do away with the filibuster.\n\nBut back to the elections: We did have those impressive results in Virginia and New Jersey, which delighted me, along with Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City, which, uh, did not.\n\nFrank: Not happy about Mamdani, Bret? Really? You were so mysterious about your true feelings about him until now.\n\nBret: What’s your read on the results?\n\nFrank: Simple. Most Americans — be they in New York, New Jersey or Virginia — are rightly upset about the cost of living, desperately want some help and are utterly unimpressed with Trump’s performance along those lines. While they struggle to make ends meet, they see images of the East Wing in rubble and read about the opulent, ostentatious ballroom that the president who’s supposed to be their champion is replacing it with. It’s like some Gilded Age caricature, and the dissonance rankles. I’m not sure the lessons of Nov. 4 are a whole lot more complicated than that. You?\n\nBret: My takeaway was this: Centrism wins. New Jersey and Virginia could have been somewhat tight races. New York should have been a cakewalk for whoever won the Democratic nomination in June. It turned out to be just the opposite. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey romped to victory because they appealed to middle-of-the road voters, while Mamdani, for all the hype, got a bare majority against two deeply flawed candidates by running on an ultra-left-wing platform — and that despite the progressive inclinations of many New York City voters. The lesson is that, outside of deep-blue precincts, polarizing candidates are a Democratic dead end.\n\nFrank: While I agree with you for the most part that centrism — or something close to it — is Democrats’ best bet, I find New York City to be so different from New Jersey and Virginia that I’m not sure the three can be combined into any one ideological story line. Also, I think we political analysts are sometimes too quick to apply the left-versus-center, liberal-versus-moderate prism to results. Maybe the more valuable takeaway for Democrats is, hey, voters like candidates who aren’t getting senior-citizen discounts and hip replacements. Sherrill: 53. Spanberger: 46. Mamdani: 34. Not a coincidence and not irrelevant.\n\nMamdani did very, very well with voters under 45, whose turnout is among the reasons that more than two million New Yorkers cast ballots for mayor for the first time since 1969. I can tell you from my conversations with the college students I teach that Mamdani’s style of communication really resonated with them. Excited them. They weren’t responding, for the most part, to his proposals. There was a generational kinship.\n\nBret: It would be good for both parties to have an informal ban on running candidates anywhere north of, say 70. That way, we might have avoided both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nThe other imperative is for parties to meet their voters where they are. Trump is president again because Democrats didn’t seem to be living on the same planet as most voters. Until last year, they were the party that wanted to pretend there was no crisis at the southern border, that inflation was “transitory,” that Joe Biden was fitter than a fiddle, and promised that “every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care they desire and need,” as Kamala Harris put it in 2019. Now candidates like Sherrill and Spanberger are saying: We want better schools and lower costs and an executive who doesn’t scare the bejesus out of you — like a certain exterior decorator in the White House.\n\nFrank: Before I respond more fully, Bret, what is a bejesus? I’ve used the word myself many times and now realize I have absolutely no idea. And does a bejesus do battle with Beelzebub?\n\nBret: No, Bejesus was a discarded character from “Beetlejuice.”\n\nFrank: As for Democrats opening the door to Trump by tacking too far left on various social and cultural issues, you know I agree with you on that. One thousand percent. But that’s not the only moral of Sherrill’s victory or of Spanberger’s. And I’d note that the examples you just gave mash together “wokeness,” bad governance, aloofness and lies. The border: terrible governance. The claim that inflation wasn’t a big deal or would soon pass: suicidally dismissive. The insistence that Biden was at his peak: the summit of mendacity. What I see in much of that isn’t far-left madness. It’s the arrogance of power.\n\nBret: My core political conviction for many years now is MASA: Make America Sane Again. The last 10 months of manic misgovernance creates a huge opportunity for Democrats, provided they don’t just try to ape Republicans by steering left and becoming obnoxious online gits. Like, for instance, a certain well-coifed governor from the left coast.\n\nFrank: OK, here we reach our most heated disagreement, Bret. You have me really worked up now. Painstakingly coifed, sweepingly coifed, unctuously coifed — these do not equal well-coifed.\n\nBret: You’re-so-vainly coifed?\n\nFrank: Cue Carly Simon. More seriously, you’ve put your finger on what gives me the greatest pause about Gavin Newsom, though I congratulate him on leading the successful effort to pass a voter referendum for redistricting in California. I don’t think we move beyond Trump by mirroring or mimicking him. For Democrats, the answer to Trump’s “owning the libs” isn’t owning or subletting or time-sharing the Trump cultists. It’s giving exhausted Americans a more inspiring alternative. That’s how Biden won in 2020. His decline afterward was so quick and messy that we tend not to remember what he did right during that campaign.\n\nBret: Different subject, Frank: the Supreme Court. On Monday, the justices declined an effort to revisit their 2015 Obergefell decision, which legalized same-sex marriages. And, in oral arguments about the legality of Trump’s imposition of tariffs without congressional consent, they sounded very leery of the government’s position. I think this is a better court than some of my liberal friends give it credit for.\n\nFrank: Um, which liberal friends would those be?\n\nBret: I have some. Really.\n\nFrank: You have many, in fact. There — I ratted you out! I was just wondering if you were pointing your finger at me.\n\nBret: Hey, I’m still pals with Gail!\n\nFrank: Look, the long view here is that just when you think you have the Supreme Court figured it out, along come rulings that let you know that you don’t. Has happened again and again, decade after decade. That seedling of hope I mentioned before? It has a companion seedling, planted by the recent Supreme Court developments you mentioned. I think it’s foolish for anyone to make any firm assumptions about what Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett will do. Especially Justice Barrett. As for Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, I expect nothing good from them. They’re apparently monarchists who finally deemed it safe to come out of the closet.\n\nBret: The court always surprises. I doubt anyone would have guessed that the two most consistently interesting justices, Gorsuch and Barrett, would be Trump nominees. Then again, I’m old enough to remember when progressives went berserk over the nomination of … David Souter. One of the great advantages of life tenure for judges is true independence — something liberals ought to think about when they fantasize about term limits for justices.\n\nOh, before we go, I hope readers didn’t miss Penelope Green’s hilarious, heartbreaking and altogether fabulous obituary in The Times for Maria Riva, the actress and memoirist whose mother was Marlene Dietrich. Dietrich was a monster of a mother and a prodigy as a lover. A sample:\n\nUntil Ms. Riva was a teenager, her mother’s many male and female suitors left the house before dawn, keeping up the ruse, for The Child, that they were just good pals. (In those early years, to name just a few, the cast included Mr. von Sternberg, Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and the poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta, who was also a lover of Greta Garbo’s.)\n\nThey often reappeared in the morning, freshly dressed in their street clothes, for breakfast. Dietrich was as enthusiastic about her cooking as her nighttime adventures. But the pantomime must have grown exhausting to all the players, Ms. Riva assumed, as her mother began billeting her with governesses in hotels and rented houses.\n\nWell, uh, wow. She reminds me, actually, of my grandmother.\n\nFrank: I love that. Here’s one more recommendation. Our colleagues Adam Nagourney, Heather Knight, Kellen Browning and Laurel Rosenhall wrote an excellent story after Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement from Congress at the end of her current term. It chronicled the time she spent in the 1980s, as a relatively new member of the House, at the bedsides of constituents in San Francisco who were dying of AIDS. I remember the AIDS epidemic, Bret. And I remember how friends I lost to the disease were treated like pariahs. What Pelosi did back then mattered, and it says as much about her — and about the true meaning of public service — as any of the many major accomplishments in her career.\n\nBret: Her finest hour.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Now, He’s Running for Court Clerk.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:01:48-05:00\n\nThe criminal clerk in New Orleans oversees an ever-expanding archive of old-school paper records: warrants, motions, judicial orders, jury instructions.\n\nCalvin Duncan learned how hard it can be to obtain those records while serving a life sentence for murder at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. He became a self-trained authority in the rules of criminal procedure, as an effort to secure his own freedom evolved into a passion that has defined his life.\n\nEven after he was released from prison and eventually exonerated, he pored over the case files of other inmates who felt their sentences were unjust and hoped their records could prove it. The next stage of that mission, as he sees it, is getting elected clerk of court himself. He is trying to convince voters in New Orleans that no one knows the importance of preserving and modernizing court records more than someone whose fate has depended on them.\n\n“The struggle I went through to get my records,” he said, “I don’t want it to happen to anyone else.”\n\nMr. Duncan, 62, entered the clerk’s race facing long odds, taking on an incumbent from a well-known New Orleans family in a contest that typically draws little attention. Yet last month, he ended up forcing the incumbent, Darren Lombard, into a runoff election that will take place on Saturday.\n\nMr. Duncan’s campaign gained momentum — and a bottom-of-the-ballot race became one of the most closely watched in the city — after Mr. Lombard started claiming that Mr. Duncan had, in fact, never been absolved of the murder in 1981 that had sent him to prison.\n\nIn a city with one of the nation’s highest rates of known wrongful convictions, Mr. Lombard struck a nerve, just not in the way he intended. His suggestion was assailed by prominent lawyers, legal scholars, activists and other political figures in New Orleans.\n\n“Lombard had been seen as a competent clerk,” said Clancy DuBos, a longtime political journalist and commentator in New Orleans. “And then his attacks just blew up in his face.”\n\nThe race has shined a spotlight on the quiet work of maintaining records and evidence — an aspect of the justice system that does not tend to show up on episodes of “Law & Order” or true crime podcasts.\n\nAs he campaigns, Mr. Duncan has stressed to voters, often in personal terms, how that work is essential to the pursuit of justice and how he believes the criminal clerk’s office has long fallen short.\n\nHis campaign has tapped into the frustrations of lawyers and others who need access to records. Elsewhere in Louisiana, court records are available online or at least easily retrievable. But in New Orleans, many see the clerk’s office as “operating the same way it could have operated 100 years ago,” said Richard Davis, the legal director of Innocence & Justice Louisiana, a nonprofit legal group that represents inmates.\n\nDigitizing the files and creating a more streamlined system would allow lawyers to dedicate “more time to the substance of the document,” Mr. Davis said. “Not just find where it is.”\n\nMr. Lombard, 59, who was elected clerk in 2021, has strenuously denied running a disorganized office. His office is in the process of digitizing records to improve public access, according to his campaign website. “The records will soon all be online!” he wrote in a recent Instagram post. “Keep up the momentum of our office by voting to continue with the current leadership!”\n\nLast week, he was endorsed by Helena Moreno, who was elected mayor in October.\n\n“He has the proven experience and knowledge to effectively manage our courts and institutions,” the mayor-elect said of Mr. Lombard in a social media post. Mr. Lombard and his campaign representatives did not respond to an emailed list of questions.\n\nMr. Lombard has gotten good reviews for his other main role as clerk, serving as the chief elections officer in New Orleans.\n\nBut 10 days before last month’s election, Mr. Lombard unsuccessfully sought a restraining order against Mr. Duncan, in part to stop him from referring to himself as “exonerated.”\n\nMr. Duncan was convicted in the murder of a 23-year-old man who was shot during a robbery in 1981. In 2011, after lawyers with Innocence Project New Orleans, which later became Innocence & Justice Louisiana, found evidence that poked holes in the case, prosecutors agreed to vacate his murder conviction if he pleaded guilty to lesser charges, ensuring his release from prison.\n\nA decade later, a judge found Mr. Duncan to be factually innocent, and the plea was expunged from his record.\n\nBut last month, Mr. Lombard cited a letter that Louisiana’s Republican attorney general, Liz Murrill, wrote to Mr. Duncan in September, arguing that because he had pleaded to the lesser charges, it was a “gross misrepresentation” to claim he had been exonerated.\n\nMore than 160 attorneys signed a public statement contending that Mr. Duncan qualified as exonerated under any reasonable definition and met the standards of the National Registry of Exonerations, an independent clearinghouse maintained by scholars.\n\n“The facts, the law and the procedural history are clear,” the letter said. “Calvin Duncan was wrongfully convicted, he has proved his innocence, and he is now fully exonerated.”\n\nBefore he was charged with murder at age 19, Mr. Duncan was raised in the Ninth Ward, an area of New Orleans that has long struggled with poverty and violence. He and other children in the neighborhood would jump rope to a nursery rhyme about being shipped off to the state prison, known as Angola, even before they knew what it was.\n\nHis arrest set him on an improbable journey. He became a jailhouse lawyer who worked on cases that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. At 60, he graduated from law school.\n\nIn jail, soon after his arrest, an older inmate suggested that if Mr. Duncan could not afford a lawyer, he had to become one.\n\nHe wrote his first motion by hand on a legal pad, asking the court for a copy of the state’s Code of Criminal Procedure. Then, he started filing civil rights lawsuits on behalf of other inmates. He secured dentures for older men who could not chew their food. He accepted candy bars as payment.\n\nAlvin Abbott, 61, grew up with Mr. Duncan and remembered him as a protector, standing up for other children in the neighborhood. At Angola, where they were incarcerated together, he saw him play a similar role.\n\nAt first, Mr. Abbott, who was serving a 33-year sentence for four armed robberies, focused on lifting weights as a way to cope.\n\nHis old friend had no patience for that.\n\n“You want to stay in prison, you stay on the iron pile,” Mr. Duncan told him.\n\nMr. Abbott got the message, and they worked together to chip away at his sentence. They succeeded, and he was released in 2001.\n\nMr. Duncan became an inmate counsel substitute at Angola, essentially working as a paralegal supporting other prisoners. He taught packed classes on the law and tracked court decisions, trying to match rulings to inmates’ cases. One of his rare infractions was for overuse of Westlaw, the online legal database.\n\nHe also taught fellow prisoners about the power of records, which could shed light on flaws in the cases against them and lead to releases or reduced sentences.\n\nInmates would sell their plasma and save the meager earnings from their prison jobs, all to pay for records.

Asia\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T05:00:12-05:00\n\nThe first bomb threats bearing the name of Takahiro Karasawa churned out of fax machines in Japan 13 years ago. Then, they appeared in South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.\n\nBut there have been no bombs. Mr. Karasawa, a Japanese lawyer, has said he has nothing to do with this. There have been arrests in connection with the threats but they have kept coming, causing panic, evacuations and investigations in multiple Asian countries.\n\nNo one has a clue about who is sending them and why.\n\nMr. Karasawa’s name has come back under the spotlight in recent months with a spike in threats in South Korea. Several schools and malls in Seoul, the capital, were evacuated after they received faxed threats.\n\nThe next month, a staff member at Ajou University, south of Seoul, received an email with the subject, “Everyone at Ajou University will die.” It said bombs had been planted at 38 locations on the campus, and was sent from an account named Takahiro Karasawa.\n\n“We panicked at first and immediately reported it to the police,” said Lee Byeong-hee, a university spokesman. Dozens of police officers and firefighters arrived at the university. One of the officers, a bomb expert, said that there were no signs of any explosives, and that another university had received a similar threat earlier that day.\n\nThe authorities believe the sender to be the same person who sent threatening faxes and emails since August 2023.\n\nSouth Korea has opened an international investigation. Its National Police Agency said last month that it had sought help from the Japanese authorities and Interpol. A South Korean official said the agency was also in touch with U.S. law enforcement agencies because the threats were sent through an American company that allows people to send faxes from the internet.\n\nInterpol did not respond to a request for comment. Japan’s National Police Agency said it does not comment on requests it has received from police officials in other countries.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no end in sight for Mr. Kurasawa, who did not comment.\n\nHe has blamed the threats on users on internet forums, who he says have targeted him because he represented victims of online harassment a decade ago.\n\nA decade after the first threats appeared in 2012, the police in Japan appeared to have a breakthrough. A man in his 20s was arrested in Tokyo on charges related to threats bearing Mr. Karasawa’s name that were sent to railway facilities.\n\nThen, in August 2023, the police in Tokyo arrested two men, both in their 20s, in connection with bomb threats that were faxed to a university.\n\nBut the messages did not just keep coming, they also spread to South Korea and other countries in the region.\n\nEmails bearing his name targeted government offices and embassies in Singapore in August 2023, triggering lockdowns. No bombs were found, and the police in Singapore said at the time that the sender was also behind similar hoax threats in South Korea.\n\nIn the Philippines, the police said last year that emailed threats to government offices, schools and railway facilities in 2023 and 2024 were traced back to a single email address bearing Mr. Karasawa’s name.\n\nAnd in Malaysia, threats were sent to a state police chief and a city council from someone claiming to be Mr. Karasawa in February last year. Malaysia’s national police said it closed the investigation after failing to identify the suspects.\n\nIn South Korea, the messages bearing Mr. Karasawa’s name are among a wave of hoax threats that have caused nationwide alarm, with at least 20 locations targeted in the last three months. No bombs were found and the police had little trouble tracking down the culprits. The threats under Mr. Karasawa’s name have yet to stop, though.\n\nEven if there is no actual threat, experts have said these messages cannot be dismissed as mere pranks.\n\n“They paralyze public institutions, schools and public facilities, and they result in excessive consumption of law enforcement resources,” said Lee Man-jong, president of the Korean Terror Studies Association. “They cause tangible harm. It’s quite serious.”\n\nMr. Karasawa said he hoped his impersonators would stop.\n\n“I have a deep affection for South Korea,” Mr. Karasawa said in a recent interview with SBS, a South Korean broadcaster. “I hope the perpetrators are caught and receive severe criminal punishment.”\n\nKiuko Notoya contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Zunaira Saieed from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/business/luxury-electric-vehicles.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:01:55-05:00","title":"The Luxury Electric Vehicle Is in Trouble","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The F-150 Lightning electric pickup, once a major success for Ford, is now in crisis due to the elimination of federal tax credits by Congress and President Trump, leading to a sharp drop in sales and the halt of production.

Ford has stopped making the truck, whose price starts at $55,000 and can rise to more than $85,000 for premium versions with added features, and it won’t say when or whether production will restart.\n\nThe Lightning’s struggles are part of a bigger shift. For many years, many of the electric vehicles that Americans bought were luxury models, like the Tesla Model S, the GMC Hummer and the Porsche Taycan, which all typically sell for more than $80,000.\n\nBut that’s changing fast. Sales of expensive electric vehicles have stalled, and buyers are gravitating toward models like the Chevrolet Equinox and Hyundai Ioniq 5, which have starting prices of around $35,000.\n\n“When the subsidy went away, the higher-dollar vehicles really began to slow down,” said Tim Hovik, whose dealership, San Tan Ford in Gilbert, Ariz., once sold dozens of Lightnings a month.\n\nLike Ford, General Motors has halted production of its Hummer EV. The Michigan factory that made that model and others is supposed to restart in January, but will run only one eight-hour shift a day instead of two. G.M. is also slowing production of electric Cadillacs.\n\n“It’s really going to be into early next year when we’re going to know what true E.V. demand is,” G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a conference call last month.\n\nTesla, the electric vehicle pioneer, has significantly cut back production of its three luxury vehicles — the Model S, the Model X, and the Cybertruck. Honda has discontinued the Acura ZDX sport utility vehicle. Stellantis canceled an electric Ram pickup before it hit showrooms.\n\nRivian, a newer automaker, is slowing production of its premium electric S.U.V.s and pickups and is preparing for a lower-priced model that is expected next year. The company recently laid off about 600 workers and lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter.\n\nEuropean automakers are also changing their plans because of the shifting industry landscape and the import tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed.\n\nMercedes-Benz had been selling electric versions of its luxury sedans and S.U.V.s in the United States but recently said it would stop importing them. Volkswagen has slowed production of the ID.Buzz, an upscale electric van that’s made in Germany.\n\nPorsche, the German sports-car maker controlled by Volkswagen, announced in September that it was halting development of several new electric cars and would spend heavily to add new gasoline-powered models. The shifts in its strategy have not been good for the company’s finances. Porsche had an operating loss of nearly one billion euros ($1.1 billion) in the third quarter.\n\n“We have seen a clear drop in demand for exclusive battery electric cars, and we are taking that into account,” Oliver Blume, chief executive of Volkswagen and Porsche, said in a conference call in September.\n\nFor most Western automakers, the decline of the electric vehicle market has a silver lining. Except for Tesla, most have been losing money on such models, with the largest losses from luxury models. But now fewer sales will mean smaller losses.\n\nIn October, U.S. electric vehicle sales fell about 33 percent from a year earlier, to 64,500, according to estimates by J.D. Power. Sales of the F-150 Lightning fell 12 percent, to 1,543 vehicles. Acura sold just 25 ZDXs, down from more than 1,200 a year earlier.\n\n“A lot of people thought that the high-end, luxury E.V. segment was going to be sustainable and it would continue to grow,” said Jessica Caldwell, vice president of insights at Edmunds, a market researcher. “But with all the changes that have come to the industry, it’s just not as big as we thought.”\n\nWhile the $7,500 tax credit was a relatively small discount on luxury cars, it helped automakers come up with lease deals that attracted affluent car buyers. Another factor in leases is the expected value of a vehicle after two or three years on the road. The values of previously leased electric models have been falling, and that has pushed up monthly payments on new leases.\n\nMr. Hovik, the Ford dealer in Arizona, said about 75 percent of the electric models he was selling were leased. “But without a strong lease proposition on those vehicles, they became very much on the high end from an affordability standpoint,” he said.\n\nHis dealership has about 75 Lightnings, and he’s hoping Ford will offer incentives to help him sell them off. Other manufacturers have already jacked up discounts. Mercedes is offering discounts of $10,000 or more on some electric models and as much as $50,000 on a Maybach EQS, which has a starting price of $180,000.\n\nThe move away from expensive electric models is also good for consumers who cannot afford them even with big discounts. Around a dozen electric models now start at less than $40,000. And Nissan and G.M. recently introduced versions of the Leaf and the Chevrolet Bolt that cost less than $30,000.\n\nAs for the Lightning, it was a milestone vehicle when it was introduced in 2022 — an electric version of the top-selling vehicle in the United States.\n\nFord set up an assembly line near Detroit and hoped to sell 150,000 a year. Initial demand was so strong that Ford increased production in 2023. But demand soon began to falter, partly because the company raised prices significantly to make up for higher costs. In 2024, Ford sold 33,000 Lightnings.The decision to halt Lightning production was also influenced by a fire at a supplier plant that produces aluminum for F-150 trucks. Facing a tight supply of aluminum, Ford decided to use the material it has for gasoline models of the truck.\n\nA Ford spokeswoman said the company has an ample inventory of Lightnings as the supplier recovers from the fire, and in the meantime it is focused on producing gas-powered and hybrid F-150s.\n\nWhile Ford won’t commit to bringing the Lightning back, its executives have said they are working on new, lower-cost models. The first — a pickup that is smaller than the Lightning — will arrive in 2027. The company says the truck’s starting price will be around $30,000.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/business/economy/private-equity-roofers-contractors-blackrock.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:01:02-05:00","title":"How Private Equity’s Vision for a Roofing Conglomerate Went Bust","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Private equity firms have pursued aggressive consolidation in the home improvement sector, particularly in roofing and remodeling, by acquiring family-owned companies like Reborn Cabinets, Dreamstyle Remodeling, and Minnesota Rusco.

October, as Nathan Hendricks drove to a cabinet installation job in Elk Grove, Calif., he got a call from his office. His employer, Reborn Cabinets, had shut down. All its workers were supposed to return their company vehicles and iPads by the following day.\n\nHe was not entirely surprised. The company had changed a lot since Audax Group, a private equity firm, bought it in 2022 and added it to a collection of home improvement brands called Renovo Home Partners. It started using lower-grade materials, forced employees to buy their own protective gear and pushed them into subcontracting roles, Mr. Hendricks said.\n\n“When I got word of this, my heart did sink,” Mr. Hendricks said. “My main concern was, what am I going to do now? Am I still going to get paid and all that?”\n\nHe didn’t get his last paycheck, or reimbursement for the $400 he spent on gas driving to job sites over the previous two weeks. About 1,500 employees were abruptly terminated, along with their health insurance. Customers were left with unfinished roofs, basements and bathrooms. Renovo’s websites, email addresses and social media went dark. Nobody answered the phone.\n\n“I thought Reborn Cabinets was going to be a family company for years to come, but they did kind of sell out,” Mr. Hendricks said. He found work with a small painting company this week, and said he would avoid private equity-owned companies in the future.\n\nRenovo’s sudden closure shows how private equity ownership can go wrong for an industry that has been flooded with funds seeking to roll up small businesses with a few million dollars a year in revenue and good reputations in their local markets.\n\nThe thesis is simple: After gaining efficiencies of scale, acquirers can sell the integrated bundle, or platform, to someone else, doubling or tripling their money. But that bet hasn’t paid off in recent years. Many home-improvement companies have stagnated as interest rates have risen and the housing market has slowed.\n\n“There’s been a lot of consolidation activity, lots of platforms launched, mostly by private equity funds, but very few have gotten to that exit,” said Randy Korach, who started a roofing company, then became chief executive of a much larger one when a private equity company bought it and several others in 2021.\n\nThe newly named Roofing Corporation of America was sold in 2023 to a public company with a range of property services. “There’s probably going to be a lot of successful platforms built, but probably others that maybe didn’t mitigate against market downturn risk,” Mr. Korach said.\n\nRenovo took shape in 2022 when the Audax Group, a Boston-based private equity firm, started buying up family-owned remodeling companies that were leaders in their regions.\n\nMinnesota Rusco had been around for 70 years, and was known for its catchy television jingle. Dreamstyle Remodeling was founded in 1989 in Albuquerque by a husband-and-wife team who amassed a 125,000-person client list. Newpro, which a family started in 1945 as a window replacement business, grew into one of the largest remodeling firms in the Northeast.\n\nThey were among seven purchased with about $150 million from some of the largest private lenders in America: BlackRock, Apollo and Oaktree Capital Management. By 2022, Renovo ranked eighth on Qualified Remodeler’s list of the largest home improvement companies, with 2,700 employees and $653 million in annual revenue.\n\nSome executives stayed on to help run their companies, but knitting them together proved difficult. Management was centralized in a “top-heavy” office of people who didn’t all have experience in home improvement, said Melanie Marfoglio, who was vice president of Reborn Cabinets when it was acquired and stayed with the company until July.\n\n“The execution was all wrong, because they didn’t take into consideration individual cultures,” Ms. Marfoglio said. “These are different customers, too, so a one-size-fits-all doesn’t really work.”\n\nCost cutting drove away top performers, said Douglas Elam, a project manager for Dreamstyle from 2021 to 2023. He left for another private-equity-owned remodeling company that closed in 2024, then rejoined Dreamstyle this year.\n\n“The biggest expenditure is labor, so they start renegotiating with the installers and say, ‘The 10 to 12 percent you were making is now going to be 8,’” Mr. Elam said. “The A team walks out the door, and we’re left with the B’s and the C’s. So quality went down, and complaints went up.”\n\nAt the same time, higher prices for labor and materials put pressure on costs. Higher interest rates dissuaded homeowners from moving, which weighed on the kind of remodeling activity that happens when houses change hands.\n\n“Renovo looked really good on the surface,” said Aaron Toomey, a managing director at Anchor Peabody, an investment advisory firm for the building industry. “Everyone who watched this industry or thought about it carefully knew that the post-Covid boom was pulling a lot of demand forward.”\n\nAlthough Dreamstyle was the worst performer, the other companies started faltering too, as aggressive expansion plans didn’t pan out and the company went through several layoffs. Qualified Remodeler reported the company’s revenues dropped to $449 million in 2024. The lenders acknowledged that Renovo wasn’t making debt payments as scheduled in late 2024, and in April 2025, BlackRock essentially foreclosed on Audax, wiping out its equity interest.\n\nBlackRock tried to restructure Renovo with new executives and more investment in integrating internal systems, and said its performance had improved. In the fall, BlackRock put the company up for sale.\n\nBut there were no offers. On the evening of Oct. 27, Renovo executives were told that the company was out of money, and that BlackRock wouldn’t put any more in. The next morning, they told their direct reports, who broke the news to everyone else, including Mr. Hendricks in Northern California.\n\nTelling workers at the company’s call centers was particularly difficult because many worked paycheck to paycheck, said Doug Herring, the former vice president for inside sales. He had been asked to set goals for the next year, had just signed a contract with a new vendor and had been approved to hire new employees.\n\n“This really came out of nowhere,” Mr. Herring said. “I’ve been doing this 30-plus years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.”\n\nA few days later, Renovo filed for bankruptcy, seeking to dissolve the business rather than reorganize it. Its petition listed less than $50,000 in assets and more than $100 million in liabilities, with hundreds of creditors. According to screenshots viewed by The New York Times, Renovo processed a last round of payroll for headquarters employees, but not for workers at its subsidiaries.\n\n“BlackRock committed substantial resources to support Renovo’s turnaround in an effort to manage investments we make on behalf of our clients,” said Patrick Scanlan, a spokesman for the company.\n\n“Despite the efforts by BlackRock and other investors to stabilize the company, significant performance and cash flow challenges persisted, and a sale process found no buyers. This ultimately led the Renovo board to determine that liquidation was the only viable option for the company.”\n\nPrivate equity is a copycat industry. In the mid-2010s, firms bundled up HVAC, pest control and plumbing contractors, which promised recurring revenue and considerable economies of scale. Many contractors, like Renovo, have been consolidated into platforms with different services that can be promoted to customers once they’ve tried one.\n\nRoofers are the latest fashion. Although homeowners don’t need a new roof very often, it’s also not something they can defer, which means it’s less subject to the ups and downs of the housing market. Demand is increasing as damaging storms become more frequent and insurance requirements tighten up.\n\nAfter a five-year acquisition spree, private equity groups own most of the largest roofing companies in the country, according to Roofing Contractor magazine’s top 100 list.\n\nJosh Sparks took private equity investment for his roofing company in 2021, and has since accumulated 25 brands under the umbrella Infinity Home Services.\n\n“It has been an all-in, full-frontal attack,” Mr. Sparks said on a roofing industry podcast. “Anybody who owns a roofing company or, heck, anyone who has a company that starts with the letter R, they’re being solicited by private equity firms.”\n\nMr. Sparks said there could be trade-offs. “They will deploy the private equity 101 model, which is what everybody’s afraid of and should be afraid of,” he said. “My question is, what value does that create for the customer?”\n\nSean Shapiro sold his roofing company to a private equity firm in 2021 and now serves as a broker for other roofing company owners looking to sell. Even with economic pressure mounting on home improvement companies, Mr. Shapiro said, he doesn’t see private equity’s appetite abating.\n\n“They’re using other people’s money for the most part, so they’re still going to go deploy it even if they are not as bullish on that industry,” Mr. Shapiro said.\n\nErie Home was founded in 1982 in Toledo, Ohio, and acquired by Gridiron Capital in 2021. Soon after, Erie pushed out some of its long-tenured executives. Bad reviews describing high-pressure sales tactics piled up.\n\nHarrison Dilthey, who worked as a salesperson in Erie’s Boston office in 2023, described the company’s tactics as predatory. Midway through his time there, Erie reduced the share of sales it would pay in commissions. That prompted representatives to open with an offer significantly higher than the true cost, Mr. Dilthey said.\n\n“The pressure of selling and the culture there was really toxic,” he said. Churn was high. Although he made $70,000 in five months and was among the company’s top performers, he said, Mr. Dilthey left after five months once he had paid off his student loans.\n\nIn September, Gridiron sold Erie to another of its portfolio companies, Leaf Home, the second-largest remodeling firm in the country, with $1.8 billion in sales. The company took on $4 billion in equity investment and debt from Apollo and Ares Management to finance the transaction.\n\n“The support and expertise of our investment partners have allowed us to build a resilient, robust and sustainable organization that will continue delivering premium products and services to homeowners for many years to come,” said Jenilee Common, chief executive of Leaf Home.\n\nDoug Farr, who worked for Erie for 20 years, left when Gridiron took over. He opened his own company, Great Lakes Remodeling, and isn’t looking to sell. But he said it was getting harder to compete against private equity-backed rivals with cash to pour into recruiting, technology and advertising.\n\n“Then you’ve got little old me, and I’m fighting that,” Mr. Farr said. “It’s a lot more difficult today because the industry is filled with a bunch of private equity money being thrown everywhere.”\n\n"}]}
