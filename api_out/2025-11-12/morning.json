Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A powerful burst of energy from the sun is streaming past Earth, disturbing energized particles in the highest levels of the atmosphere and painting stunning aurora borealis displays across the night sky as far south as Texas, Alabama, Georgia and even Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Several eruptions of energy from the sun, known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are expected to reach Earth’s magnetic field over the next two nights. The Space Weather Prediction Center issued a G4 “severe” geomagnetic storm watch for Tuesday and Wednesday. G4 is the second-strongest level on the five-step scale.\n \n\n   \n    What a G4 storm means\n \n\n   \n  Geomagnetic storms happen when the solar wind rushes through Earth’s magnetosphere. Charged particles from the sun interact with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing stunning northern lights, or glowing curtains of green, red and purple light that ripple across the sky.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all beauty and wonder; a G4 storm brings potential for voltage control problems in power systems, GPS navigation errors and intermittent issues with radio and satellite operations.\n \n\n   \n  This latest round of solar eruptions includes several CMEs from an active sunspot cluster. Shawn Dahl, a space weather forecaster at the Space Weather Prediction Center, notes that an additional, even stronger CME is expected midday Wednesday — along with the chance to see the northern lights farther south than normal.\n \n\n   \n  For most people, the impacts will be limited to breathtaking skies, not power outages. But it’s a good reminder that no matter how advanced we become as a society, the sun still calls the shots.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/jack-schlossberg-jfk-grandson-us-house-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:14:00-05:00","title":"Jack Schlossberg, John F.

Ultimately,  eight members  of the Democratic caucus crossed lines to move a step closer to breaking the stalemate on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the focus is on the House, where GOP leaders believe lawmakers will end the stalemate this week.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.\n \n\n   \n    It’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  The Senate-passed package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through t﻿he remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin GOP majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson told his members Monday to start making their way back to Washington and put them on 36-hour vote notice after the Senate passed the continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m stating the obvious: All my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible,” the Republican leader said Monday.\n \n\n   \n    When will the House vote?\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to begin voting on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer.\n \n\n   \n  The vote will take place as early as 4 p.m., per the notice, which forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The House Rules Committee voted on party lines early Wednesday morning to advance the Senate-passed package to reopen the government, a key hurdle the bill needed to clear before a floor vote.\n \n\n   \n  The panel did not adopt any amendments offered in committee during the seven-hour meeting, including amendments extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Next, the full House will have to take a procedural vote on the rule, expected to happen on Wednesday, before moving to vote on final passage of the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The House hasn’t voted or been in legislative session since September 19.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the lawmakers to watch?\n \n\n   \n  Johnson will have to work closely with the White House to muscle this deal through the House, given it is unclear how many Democrats will cross over to support the package and Republicans hold such a narrow majority.\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen moderate House Republicans had wanted to see the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies extended and had their  own bill   to address the issue at the center of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, House Democratic leadership is actively working to prevent rank-and-file members from voting for this bill because they say it falls short of what Democrats fought for during the shutdown. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who is not seeking reelection and has been known to vote with Republicans, is among those to watch.\n \n\n   \n    What are House Democratic leaders saying?\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his team hope to limit the number of Democrats who support the plan, which will maximize pressure on House Republicans to land the votes themselves. And House Democratic leaders are officially whipping against the Senate funding compromise, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The House Democratic leader reiterated to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that Democrats will “strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican health care crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to reopen the government. We’ll continue to stand by our hardworking federal employees and civil servants. But we have a responsibility to make sure that we extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so that tens of millions of Americans don’t experience dramatically increased health care costs that’s going to prevent them from being able to see a doctor when they need one,” Jeffries said on “The Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n    Does the government open as soon as the House passes the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Not quite yet.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What does Trump think of the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has already endorsed the Senate plan to reopen the government, calling the funding deal a “positive development” toward ending the record-long shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” a White House official said in a statement. “The action in the Senate is a positive development and we look forward to seeing it progress.”\n \n\n   \n  And adding to expectation that Trump will sign the measure, the president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I would say so,” when asked whether he personally approved of the deal making its way through Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said Monday. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the funding package?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap measure through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/americas/el-salvador-prison-cecot-venezuela-hrw-cristosal-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Dozens of Venezuelans deported from US to notorious Salvadoran prison subjected to torture, rights groups claim in new report","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A joint report by Human Rights Watch and Cristosal alleges that dozens of Venezuelans deported from the United States to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) in early 2025 were subjected to widespread torture, sexual violence, and psychological abuse.

They describe being beaten by guards, with some being taken to solitary confinement as punishment for protesting, and others being driven to the brink of suicide.\n \n\n   \n  The report accuses El Salvador’s prison system of systematic human rights violations and the Trump administration of complicity in torture, enforced disappearances and other violations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a CNN inquiry, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defended the administration’s decision to send the migrants to Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  “At President (Donald) Trump’s direction, DHS deported nearly 300 Tren de Aragua and MS-13 terrorists to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) Prison in El Salvador, where they no longer pose a threat to the American people,” said a statement attributed to   Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reached out to the Salvadoran presidency and the Salvadoran prisons directorate for comment. In the past, El Salvador’s government has said that it respects the human rights of people in its custody, “regardless of their nationality,” and that its prison system complies with safety and order standards.\n \n\n   \n     They ‘arrived in hell’ \n \n\n   \n  “The nightmare began the moment they took me off the plane,” the report quotes Gonzalo, a 26-year-old from Zulia, Venezuela, as saying. Gonzalo claims the migrants were beaten upon landing in El Salvador and that the mistreatment continued when they were transferred to Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  He said a prison official told them, “You have arrived in hell.”\n \n\n   \n  He and others interviewed by HRW and Cristosal alleged that guards periodically assaulted them with kicks, punches and batons during daily cell searches.\n \n\n   \n  Three of the people interviewed said they were subjected to sexual violence, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the inmates reported being humiliated by the guards, who allegedly told them they “would never get out alive,” that “nobody knew they were there,” and that “their families had abandoned them.”\n \n\n   \n  Several inmates reported having suicidal thoughts, and at least one said he attempted suicide.\n \n\n   \n  “I fell into depression. I wanted to kill myself because I thought I would be better off dead. In the end, the only thing that gave me strength was God … and my family, my wife, my daughter, and my mother,” another detainee, Nelson, says in the report.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the findings in the report match what several former detainees told CNN in late July, days after being released from Cecot and repatriated to Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Welcome to the hell of Cecot,” Venezuelan makeup artist  Andry Hernández  recalled in a CNN interview about his arrival at the Salvadoran prison.\n \n\n   \n   Jerce Reyes ,  José Mora and Rafael Martínez  all told CNN   they were frequently beaten by guards – often for disobeying the prison’s strict rules or for reasons they considered unwarranted. They also accused Salvadoran prison authorities of denying them of basic human rights, including access to attorneys and adequate living conditions.\n \n\n   \n  On a hot day, Reyes said he showered to keep cool at a time he wasn’t allowed to. The guards caught him, entered the cell, beat him up and sent him to a smaller isolated cell as punishment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Martínez alleged that he was once punished for putting his head through the cell bars when he felt sick. He said he was taken to a different cell, where about eight guards beat him and fractured his right arm.\n \n\n   \n  “(The guards) tortured us physically and psychologically,” Mora said.\n \n\n   \n  The men also spoke about going on strike to demand basic rights, including communication with the outside world. But their protests were met with a fierce response from guards, they said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we protested, they shot at us point-blank with rubber bullets, point-blank into the cell,” Mora told CNN. “We were like chickens or rats locked up … and they shot us with rubber bullets.”\n \n\n   \n     Claims of criminal involvement  \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration accused the deportees, without proof, of being linked to the Tren de Aragua criminal organization.\n \n\n   \n  Human Rights Watch and Cristosal claimed in their report that approximately half of the Venezuelans sent to Cecot had no criminal records and only 3% had been convicted in the United States for a violent or potentially violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  In its response to CNN, DHS insisted the nearly 300 detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs, saying the groups are “some of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth” and asserted that they “rape, maim, and murder for sport.”\n \n\n   \n  Reyes, Mora and Martínez said they were wrongly accused by US officials of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang and, despite their denials, were deported from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  According to records, Martínez faced robbery charges in the US, pleaded guilty, and was released on bail before being arrested and sent to a Salvadoran prison.\n \n\n   \n  Mora, meanwhile, was imprisoned in Venezuela for drug-related offenses and served his sentence. In the United States, he received traffic violations, according to official records.\n \n\n   \n  CNN verified that Reyes has no criminal record in his home country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/japan-takaichi-china-taiwan-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00-05:00","title":"How Japan’s new prime minister has brought China’s ‘wolf warriors’ back out","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, has reignited a tense diplomatic standoff with China by stating that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan would be a threat to Japan’s survival, a statement that directly challenges Beijing’s claims over the island.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the end, there was no honeymoon period.\n \n\n   \n  Just two weeks ago,  Japan’s  new prime minister Sanae Takaichi was shaking hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, relations between the two Asian nations have dramatically soured, with escalating nationalist rhetoric in  China  and even an apparent threat of beheading from one of its diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi, who was elected as Japan’s  first female prime minister  just last month, has become embroiled in a growing row with Beijing over Taiwan – the democratic island that China’s ruling Communist Party claims as its own, and a red line  it has warned  other countries not to cross.\n \n\n   \n  The furor began when Takaichi  told the Japanese parliament  on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan – which lies just 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Japanese territory – would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival” and could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of the island and has ramped up the frequency and complexity of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “ strategic ambiguity .”\n \n\n   \n  Wading into the thorny issue of Taiwan’s defense has gotten other world leaders in hot water with Beijing before. Former US President Joe Biden set off a diplomatic panic during his time in office when he  said multiple times  that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan – forcing the White House to repeatedly walk back his comments, and sparking anger each time in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s remarks were met with an even more vehement response.\n \n\n   \n  “The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” wrote the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  The fallout has  spiraled  since, with Japan criticizing Xue’s “extremely inappropriate” post and Taiwan voicing concern about Xue’s “threatening” remarks, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, meanwhile, has defended its position and Xue’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry on Monday accused Japan of “grossly interfering with China’s internal affairs,” saying Xue’s post was simply responding to Takaichi’s “erroneous and dangerous remarks.”\n \n\n   \n  For some, the controversy harks back to China’s “ wolf warrior ” diplomacy – an aggressive style of foreign policy that emerged in the early 2020s, which often saw Chinese officials take to social media platforms to hit back directly - and often colorfully - at any criticism of China, but has since been dialed back as Beijing looked to win back lost goodwill among Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  And within China, where there is already significant streak of anti-Japanese sentiment, state media and other prominent voices this week have further fanned outrage over Takaichi’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily condemned Takaichi as “recklessly shooting her mouth off,” and warning: “No one should harbor any illusion that they can cross the line on the Taiwan issue without paying a price.”\n \n\n   \n  A social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV asked: “Has her head been kicked by a donkey?”\n \n\n   \n  Hu Xijin, a Chinese pundit and former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times, offered a more violent warning, echoing the threats from the diplomat Xue.\n \n\n   \n  “China’s battle blade for beheading invaders has been sharpened to a very keen edge,” he wrote in a post on Tuesday. “If Japanese militarism wishes to come to the Taiwan Strait to sacrifice themselves on our blades, we will fulfill them.”\n \n\n   \n    A tangled relationship\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi said Monday that her comments were “hypothetical,” and said she would avoid making similar comments in parliament again. But the prime minister is walking a  tightrope  every Japanese leader has had to balance.\n \n\n   \n  China remains Japan’s largest trading partner, and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes.  At the same time, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative views, like her mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity and criticized Beijing’s growing military presence in the region.\n \n\n   \n  This uneasy relationship was on display when  Takaichi met Xi  at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October. The two leaders agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship,” Takaichi said afterward; however, she also raised with Xi the hot-button issue of China’s activity in the East China Sea, including around islands claimed by both countries.\n \n\n   \n  Even before she took office, Takaichi’s stance on Taiwan was clear. She visited the island earlier this year and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. During the APEC summit, she also met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  The current spat comes during a year when Japan-China relations are already strained, in part because of Tokyo’s colonial and war-time past.\n \n\n   \n  September marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Beijing commemorated with a  massive military parade . There’s longstanding historical hostility between the two countries; China was a crucial Allied partner, fighting against Japan’s full-scale invasion that ended only with Tokyo’s formal surrender in 1945.\n \n\n   \n  The scars of that era run deep. Japanese Imperial troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the  Nanjing Massacre  – one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the parade, Chinese officials ramped up their rhetoric and accused Japan of whitewashing history. Adding fuel to the fire, China also released at least  four WWII films this year,  including some that depict the Nanjing Massacre and the sinking of a Japanese vessel.\n \n\n   \n  Fearing a spike in anti-Japanese sentiment ahead of the parade, the Japanese embassy in Beijing warned its citizens to stay cautious and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public – perhaps mindful that in recent years, there has been a spate of  violent attacks  against  Japanese nationals in China .\n \n\n   \n  That complex history involves Taiwan, too.\n \n\n   \n  The island was once a Japanese colony that Imperial China had ceded to Imperial Japan. After Japan was defeated in WWII, China’s ruling Nationalists took control of Taiwan – then, several years later, fled to the island and moved their seat of government there after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n \n\n   \n  Today, the CCP views the self-ruling island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary. Party leaders and state media have repeatedly claimed that the end of WWII marked the island’s return to Chinese rule and liberation from Japanese occupation – a view Chinese officials alluded to this week as they berated Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan holds historical responsibility towards the Chinese people regarding the Taiwan issue, having committed unmentionable crimes during the 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan,” said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday when asked about Takaichi’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Eighty years ago, we defeated the Japanese aggressors, restored Taiwan, and ended their occupation and plunder,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Should anyone again attempt to challenge China’s core interests” or thwart reunification with Taiwan, Chen said, “will never accept or tolerate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/mega-millions-billion-dollar-jackpot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Mega Millions jackpot nears $1 billion after there were no big winners in Tuesday’s drawing","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Mega Millions jackpot is nearing $1 billion after no big winners in Tuesday’s drawing, with the estimated prize for Friday’s draw at $965 million—the eighth-largest since the game began in 2002.

\nUpdated: \n        3:36 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – is his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/thailand-suspends-peace-accord-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:59:00-05:00","title":"Thailand ‘halts’ peace agreement with Cambodia hailed by Trump after landmine explosion injures troops","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thailand has reversed its commitment to a peace agreement with Cambodia, signed in late October 2025 in Malaysia and witnessed by US President Donald Trump, after a landmine explosion on the border injured four Thai soldiers, including one with a severed leg.

Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Malaysia in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  hailed the declaration  as further proof of his ability to end wars but within less than a fortnight the agreement has begun fraying.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the supreme commander of Thailand’s armed forces, Gen. Ukris Boontanondha, said he was “halting all agreements until Cambodia clearly and sincerely demonstrates that it will not be ‘hostile’,” according to a Facebook post from Thailand’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sihasak Phuangketkeow said they would clarify their decision to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent major U-turn came after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand, on the volatile border with Cambodia Monday.\n \n\n   \n  One soldier’s right leg was severed in the blast, while another suffered shrapnel wounds to the leg, the army said. The incident happened while troops were on a “routine patrol along a frequently used route,” said Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army.\n \n\n   \n  After visiting the wounded soldiers near the contested border on Tuesday Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said, “Today, we consider that the agreement we had in place to move toward peace has ended.”\n \n\n   \n  “Thailand belongs to us. The ground we are standing on right now is Thailand. No one can claim sovereignty over Thai territory,” Anutin added.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand accused Cambodia of violating the joint declaration by laying fresh landmines following the removal of a barbed wire fence, which was discovered on November 9.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot independently verify the claims that Cambodian troops laid fresh landmines.\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government said in a statement it “categorically denies the allegations,” adding that it has not deployed new landmines “and will never do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia also said it is “gravely concerned” about reports that Thailand has suspended the peace declaration and it remains committed to implementing the peace accord.\n \n\n   \n  “Most minefields, from nearly three decades of Cambodia’s civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s, along the Cambodia-Thailand border have not yet been cleared due to the difficult terrains and the un-demarcated status of the border areas,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation remains calm,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson said Tuesday after military forces from both sides communicated following the landmine explosion.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Thailand also calls into question the already tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, who were scheduled to be handed over under the terms of the declaration. Thailand’s Defense Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit said the expected release would not go ahead.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile peace agreement\n \n\n   \n  In late October, Trump traveled to Malaysia as part of his three-leg tour of Asia and presided over the signing of a  peace declaration  between the leaders of Thailand Cambodia amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts in the border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was considered by Trump as a major diplomatic victory, and another fillip to his much vaunted –  and often over-exaggerated  – campaign to have ended several wars.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought brief skirmishes in recent decades over their disputed border and the fighting earlier was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had warned the two leaders that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration included a commitment to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, de-mining efforts, and to de-escalate tensions that erupted into the brief but deadly border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement was built on the truce signed in July, but fell short of a “peace treaty,” despite Trump  repeatedly describing  it as such. And  analysts had cautioned  of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.\n \n\n   \n  Anutin had qualified the signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration. And Thai diplomats were carefully reticent about the joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire  both sides agreed  to in July.\n \n\n   \n  Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia announced at the time “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of landmines along the Thai-Cambodia border has also been a major point of contention for the Thais. The most recent border flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry.

an already tense year \n       \n  Analysis by Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:27 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a bustling  Delhi  neighborhood, forensics teams combed through the charred skeleton of a car. Less than 24 hours later, the air outside  Islamabad’s  judicial complex was thick with the aftermath of a suicide bomb.\n \n\n   \n  The two deadly attacks are separate, and no evidence currently links the two. But for the two South Asian rivals, the political shockwave caused by the blasts are a stark reminder of the  lingering security issues  that fester below the surface throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  Explosions in their heavily fortified capitals are a rarity, and two in as many days have put officials in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan on edge, potentially  reigniting a cycle  of suspicion and blame after what has already been a tense year for all countries.\n \n\n   \n  A suicide bombing in Islamabad on Tuesday killed at least 12 people and injured 20 more, marking the deadliest such attack to strike the Pakistani capital in nearly two decades. It came just a day after a rare car explosion tore through a historic Delhi neighborhood, killing at least 10 and leaving more than a dozen wounded.\n \n\n   \n  The twin tragedies have handed political hardliners in both New Delhi and Islamabad a potent weapon, ratcheting up domestic pressure on each government to act decisively.\n \n\n   \n  The blame game ignited almost immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, without providing evidence, accused “Indian terrorist proxies” for the Islamabad attack, claiming it was “backed by India” from Afghan soil. New Delhi fired back, rejecting the “baseless and unfounded allegations” as “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the Delhi blast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring “all those responsible… to justice.” He labeled the incident a “conspiracy” but stopped short of officially designating it a terror attack.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi has not named Pakistan in connection with the explosion, and authorities have so far remained tight lipped as to who they believe might be responsible. But in past attacks, India has frequently  pointed the finger  at Islamabad, which is what makes this week’s twin attacks potentially fraught.\n \n\n   \n  “We are witnessing an increasingly fragile security environment across South Asia,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “South Asia cannot afford further confrontation; the region is being held together by fragile ceasefires with no long-term resolution. What’s needed now is restraint, reflection, and a commitment to reset the regional course toward stability.”\n \n\n   \n    Secure capitals\n \n\n   \n  While both India and Pakistan have historically faced significant security threats, their capitals are meant to be fortresses – home to the seats of government, military leadership, and the diplomatic corps.\n \n\n   \n  In Delhi, the attack struck near the iconic Red Fort, a landmark and tourist hub teeming with crowded bazaars and street vendors. It came hours after police found thousands of kilograms of explosives from a village in Faridabad, a city just outside New Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Faridabad police official confirmed to CNN that police are investigating whether the recovery of these explosives was linked to the Red Fort blast. Police in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been conducting a joint operation across these states, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Modi has  built his brand  on a muscular national security policy, casting himself as the nation’s “watchman” and opposition politicians immediately seized on the alleged security lapse.\n \n\n   \n  “If the country is not safe… if the people are not safe… Questions will be asked,” Supriya Shrinate, a national spokesperson for the Indian National Congress, told local news agency ANI. She criticized the prime minister for traveling to Bhutan a day after the attack. “People… are starting to feel that the country is not in strong hands,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Across the border in Islamabad, the explosion occurred in the parking lot of the judicial complex, an area situated within a district that is home to numerous high-ranking government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan experiences chronic instability at the hands of militants, but Islamabad rarely witnesses such attacks thanks to a heavy security presence with Tuesday’s explosion being the deadliest to strike the capital since 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been carrying a heavy burden and a great distress in my mind,” advocate Jaseem Ahmed Bhutto, who witnessed the attack, told Reuters. “It’s a sense of confusion and concern that if the courts, where every ordinary and prominent person goes and where cases are resolved, are not safe, then who is safe in this city?”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP) behind some of the country’s deadliest attacks over the past decade, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement seen by CNN. The TTP, however, distanced itself, according to its spokesman Mohammad Khursasani.\n \n\n   \n  The bombing prompted a furious response from the government. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif declared a “state of war” and described the attack as a “wake-up call” regarding Afghanistan – a reference to Pakistan’s allegation that militant safe havens on Afghan soil are the source of its problems.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in militant violence since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021, fueling cross-border tensions that recently erupted into the  worst clashes  the two countries have seen in years.   Recent talks  in Qatar and Istanbul aimed at ending the latest cross-border fighting in have made little progress.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban have denied backing the Pakistani Taliban and expressed “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding Tuesday’s attack in Islamabad.\n \n\n   \n  According to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, this year “has been particularly bad” for Pakistan and Afghanistan, “not just in terms of the loss of life of Pakistani soldiers, but many officer ranked personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  This, he noted, is something “the political and military leadership in Pakistan has taken very seriously.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A moment of great volatility’\n \n\n   \n  The cycle of accusations and hyperbole following attacks in India and Pakistan is a well-documented political pattern. And while this rhetoric serves both government’s political needs, it also has the potential to push the countries into dangerous standoffs.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s attacks come “in a moment of great churn and volatility in South Asia,” according to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.\n \n\n   \n  With Pakistan blaming Taliban-backed militants it sees as being   sponsored by India, the situation could escalate, he said. “We’re looking at a potential crisis that could engulf not two but three countries of South Asia: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India,” Kugelman added.\n \n\n   \n  This blame game is fueled by deep-seated narratives on both sides.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Pakistan has accused India of sponsoring terrorism on its soil, claiming that Indian intelligence uses Afghanistan as a base to support anti-Pakistan militants like the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, India has long accused Pakistan of supporting and harboring militants that carry out attacks. Both sides deny each other’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s blaming of India for Tuesday’s suicide attack comes just months after the two nuclear-armed rivals engaged in their most intense fighting in decades: a  four-day conflict  in May featuring clashes with fighter jets, missiles, and drones.\n \n\n   \n  That deadly conflict was  triggered by a massacre  at a scenic mountain spot in India-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Following a familiar script, India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied. Modi  redefined  India’s policy on terrorism in the aftermath, which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered “an act of war.” New Delhi launched airstrikes against its neighbor, which prompted a swift military retaliation from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  According to Humayun, many in Pakistan might have been watching the aftermath of the Delhi blast with “bated breath,” anxious to see if the familiar finger-pointing from India would begin. He highlighted the initial “restraint on the Indian side” as a departure from that script.\n \n\n   \n  But if the Indian government suggests the blast was a terrorist attack, “the public will likely expect something big in response from the Indian government,” Kugelman said. “That said, I don’t think there will be as much pressure on New Delhi.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s principal counter-terrorism body, the National Investigation Agency, has taken over the probe.\n \n\n   \n  As governments separately attempt to get to the bottom of both attacks, the citizens of Delhi and Islamabad are left cleaning up the debris and mourning their dead.\n \n\n   \n  Both capitals had, for years, been largely “insulated from these kinds of incidents,” Humayun said.\n \n\n   \n  That they can now occur in these cities suggest that this type of vulnerability “is no longer just a symptom of the hinterland. It’s coming to major metropolises.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-domestic-talent-jobs-h1b-visas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:12:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump Says U.S. Doesn’t Have Talented People to Fill Jobs Domestically","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, in a Fox News interview, argues that the United States lacks sufficient skilled workers to meet domestic job demands, particularly in complex industries like battery manufacturing.

 Donald Trump  told Fox News in an interview that aired Tuesday night the United States doesn’t have talented workers to fill jobs needed domestically, defending the  H1-B skilled worker visa program. \n \n\n   \n  Pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether his administration would  reduce H1-B visas  over concerns it would depress wages for American workers, Trump told Ingraham, “I agree — but you also do have to bring in talent.”\n \n\n   \n  When the Fox host responded, “We have plenty of talented people here,” Trump replied, “No, you don’t, no you don’t … you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory where we’re going to make missiles.’”\n \n\n   \n  The president pointed to the  September ICE raid of a Georgia Hyundai facility , which saw authorities arrest and deport hundreds of South Korean contractors over their immigration status, as evidence of the country’s need for skilled foreign workers.\n \n\n   \n  “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments come just two weeks after he told reporters traveling with him to South Korea that he was   “very much opposed” to the raid  carried out by federal officers as part of his administration’s immigration crackdown at US worksites.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signed an executive action in September to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas. The move marked the latest in a series of efforts from the administration to crack down on immigration and place sharp new limits on the types of foreigners allowed into the country.\n \n\n   \n  The H-1B visa is a work visa that’s valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US.\n \n\n   \n  In the first part of the Fox News interview that aired Monday, Trump  took a swipe at the nation of France  while defending the enrollment of Chinese students at universities in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually think it’s good to have outside countries,” the president said when asked about enrolling Chinese nationals at American universities.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not the French. They’re the Chinese. They spy on us. They steal our intellectual property,” Ingraham responded.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you think the French are better?” Trump said. Ingraham replied, “Yeah,” to which the president said, “I’m not so sure.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/zhimin-qian-cryptocurrency-fraud-scheme-jailed-uk-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Chinese ‘cryptoqueen’ who had royal aspirations jailed in UK over $6.6 billion Bitcoin scam","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zhimin Qian, a Chinese woman known as the 'cryptoqueen,' was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in a UK court for running a $6.6 billion Ponzi scheme between 2014 and 2017, defrauding over 128,000 people in China.

pounds ($6.6 billion) in Bitcoin after defrauding more than 128,000 people in China in a Ponzi scheme was sentenced by a UK court on Tuesday to over 11 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Police said the investigation into Zhimin Qian, 47, led to officers recovering devices holding 61,000 Bitcoin in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets.\n \n\n   \n  When she attracted the attention of Chinese authorities, Qian fled to the UK under a fake identity. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month, and tried but failed to buy multimillion pound properties in a bid to convert the Bitcoin.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators found notes Qian had written documenting her aspirations — including her “intention to become the monarch of  Liberland , a self-proclaimed country consisting of a strip of land between Croatia and Serbia.”\n \n\n   \n  They said other notes showed Qian detailing her hopes of “meeting a duke and royalty.”\n \n\n   \n  Judge Sally-Ann Hales said Qian was the architect of the crimes from start to finish.\n \n\n   \n  “Your motive was one of pure greed. You left China without a thought for the people whose investments you had stolen and enjoyed for a period of time a lavish lifestyle. You lied and schemed, all the while seeking to benefit yourself,” Hales said.\n \n\n   \n  The businesswoman, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering offenses and transferring and possessing criminal property, was sentenced Tuesday to 11 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court.\n \n\n   \n  She was sentenced alongside her accomplice Seng Hok Ling, 47, a Malaysian national who was accused of helping Qian transfer and launder the cryptocurrency. Ling was jailed at the same court for four years and 11 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of transferring criminal property.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/toy-story-5-teaser-watch-now","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-05:00","title":"Screens are the enemy in new ‘Toy Story 5’ teaser trailer","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'Toy Story 5' poses a modern parenting dilemma by introducing a frog-framed tablet named Lilypad to Bonnie Anderson, the sister of Andy, signaling a potential shift in children's entertainment from physical toys to digital screens.

is the fateful question posed by the new teaser trailer for “Toy Story 5,” released by Pixar on Tuesday, which picks up on the familiar parenting conundrum about screentime.\n \n\n   \n  The brief clip, set to the strains of INXS’ “Never Tear Us Apart,” shows a new package being delivered to Bonnie Anderson, little sister to Andy, who inherited all his toys back in 2010’s emotional “Toy Story

opened to reveal a frog-framed tablet named Lilypad, who beckons to Bonnie, “Let’s play!”\n \n\n   \n  Judging from the girl’s enthusiastic reaction, the toys in this story will have their work cut

aquarium without access to daylight or fresh air, saying their living conditions are “utterly unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  The 15 Gentoo penguins are housed in an enclosure at the Sea Life London Aquarium, located next to the River Thames, a short distance from the Houses of Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, first opened its penguin exhibit in May 2011, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.\n \n\n   \n  Campaigners say the penguins “are a small colony, in a tiny enclosure, that does not meet their physical and social needs and does not allow them to enjoy their natural behaviours.”\n \n\n   \n  “Their enclosure offers just 6-7 feet of depth in which to dive — a pitiful fraction of the 600ft they can dive to in the wild,” animal advocates say in a petition that’s been signed by more than 37,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Now, more than 70 members of parliament have signed a letter sent to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), asking the government to “consider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioural, ecological and physiological needs,” PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The letter was coordinated by David Taylor, a lawmaker from the ruling Labour party.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s un-British to keep penguins trapped in a basement with no daylight or fresh air. No animal should live like that, with their rights appearing to be traded for hard cash,” said Taylor.\n \n\n   \n  Another signatory, Danny Chambers, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democrat party, said the penguins were kept in “utterly unacceptable” conditions.\n \n\n   \n  “They are denied fresh air, natural light and the space they need to thrive,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign to release the penguins and to cease all breeding programs at the aquarium has gained traction in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Broadcaster and environmental campaigner Chris Packham attended a protest outside the aquarium last month, calling the living conditions “completely obscene,” adding: “It must not go on.”\n \n\n   \n  “These 15 penguins are currently being housed underground with no access to daylight or fresh air in a basement that has continuously held penguins since May 2011. One penguin, Polly, has been held there for over 14 years,” said Packham in the social media post.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from the Merlin Entertainments’ Conservation, Welfare & Education team said in a statement that it had a team of specialists that ensure the penguins are “healthy and thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  The facility where the penguins are housed was designed in conjunction with vets and penguin specialists, they added, and told PA media that the facility is on the ground floor of the aquarium rather than the basement.\n \n\n   \n  “Releasing them into the wild simply isn’t a safe option for these penguins, who have always lived in human care,” said the spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a complex issue. There’s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what’s best for the animals.”\n \n\n   \n  A DEFRA spokesperson told CNN in a statement: “This government is committed to the highest standards of animal welfare.

Rhodes said he expects that suit to go to trial.\n \n\n   \n  “The most important consequence was that, you know, if you act like a bully, you try to weaponize the criminal justice system against the press, there’s going to be a price to pay, and that price is now measured in millions,” Meyer said. “This is just the first shoe of two shoes to fall. This is the county portion of it. The city was the main instigator of this raid.”\n \n\n   \n  Meyer noted that press freedoms are still under attack across the country and more needs to be done to stop incidents like this from happening elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  “This is kind of a part of the system these days where the Justice Department is weaponized against political enemies, where laws are stretched to their breaking point, where … if you want to enforce some law, you can go out and do whatever you want unless somebody challenges it in court. Well, guess what? Somebody did challenge it in court, and we won,” Meyer said.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement means Joan Meyer’s death was not in vain, Rhodes said.\n \n\n   \n  “Her death prompted this rallying cry by press organizations across the world, not just the United States, but across the world, that it’s time to stand up to these bullying techniques,” the attorney said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/uk-suspends-caribbean-intelligence-sharing-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00-05:00","title":"Exclusive: UK suspends some intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Kingdom has suspended intelligence sharing with the United States regarding suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean, citing concerns that US military strikes—killing 76 people—violate international law and constitute extrajudicial killings.

intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:22 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the UK, which controls a number of territories in the Caribbean where it bases intelligence assets, has helped the US locate vessels suspected of carrying drugs so that the US Coast Guard could interdict them, the sources said. That meant the ships would be stopped, boarded, its crew detained, and drugs seized.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence was typically sent to Joint Interagency Task Force South, a task force stationed in Florida that includes representatives from a number of partner nations and works to reduce the illicit drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  But shortly after the US began launching lethal strikes against the boats in September, however, the UK grew concerned that the US might use intelligence provided by the British to select targets. British officials believe the US military strikes, which have killed 76 people, violate international law, the sources said. The intelligence pause began over a month ago, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last month that the strikes violate international law and amount to “extrajudicial killing.” The UK agrees with that assessment, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The British embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official told CNN that the department “doesn’t talk about intelligence matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, Cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights — something the UK was happy to help with, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has argued that the US military can legally kill suspected traffickers because they pose an imminent threat to Americans and are “enemy combatants” who are in an “armed conflict” with the US, according to a memo sent by the administration to Congress. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel  issued an opinion , which is still classified, reinforcing that argument, CNN has reported, and Trump has designated a number of drug cartels as “foreign terrorist groups.” The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say the Law of Armed Conflict  would still apply to civilian drug traffickers , and the designation of a group as a foreign terrorist organization does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force. Several boats hit by the US have either been stationary or were turning around when they were attacked, CNN has reported, undermining the administration’s claim that they posed an imminent threat that could not be dealt with through interdiction and arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US defense officials have also expressed skepticism of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey,  offered to resign  during a tense meeting last month with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey will leave his post in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful. Hegseth’s spokesperson has previously denied that any lawyers involved in the operations have dissented.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, another key US ally which has helped the US Coast Guard interdict suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean for nearly two decades, has also distanced itself from the US military strikes. The sources told CNN that Canada intends to continue its partnership with the Coast Guard, called Operation Caribbean. But the country has made clear to the US that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Canada’s defense  told Canadian press  last month that “it is important to note that Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbean, conducted in co-ordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct” from the US military strikes on suspected drug vessels.\n \n\n   \n  Colombian President  Gustavo Petro  said Tuesday that he had similarly ordered his country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the attacks in the Caribbean stop, saying in a post on X, “The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/supreme-court-extends-hold-on-full-snap-payments","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Keeps Full SNAP Payments on Hold with Short-Term Order","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court extended a short-term administrative stay that blocks the Trump administration from paying full SNAP benefits for November, prolonging a legal standoff over whether the USDA must provide full food assistance during a government shutdown.

     6:43 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended a short-term order that allows the Trump administration to withhold paying for full food stamp payments in November, a move that appeared designed to put off the case a few days in the hope that Congress approves a pending  agreement to reopen the federal government .\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving emergency appeal at the Supreme Court over Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that help more than 40 million Americans – as well as several lawsuits playing out in lower courts – would almost certainly be dismissed as moot if the historic shutdown ends in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  But until that happens, the “administrative stay” that  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued Friday  will continue to block a lower court order that required the administration to provide full federal food benefits.\n \n\n   \n  In a new brief order on Tuesday, the court said it was extending the administrative stay through the end of the day Thursday. Jackson dissented from the extension.\n \n\n   \n  Along with canceled flights, the spiraling legal battle over food stamps became a defining and tangible impact of the shutdown. The groups challenging the administration told the Supreme Court in a brief earlier Tuesday that SNAP beneficiaries had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food” and that millions of Americans, including children, were going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps on a staggered basis throughout each month. Nearly 27 million should have gotten their allotments by Monday, according to estimates by Code for America, which works with governments to improve access to safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive around $350, on average, each month to help them buy food, though for many families, the assistance is spent quickly.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration countered that a lower court that ordered full SNAP payments was out of line, requiring the US Department of Agriculture to transfer about $4 billion out of one fund and into another. And, the Justice Department warned, the lower court orders on food aid “inject the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Under a separate court order that was not before the Supreme Court, the administration relied on contingency funds to pay partial food stamp benefits for November. The question before the Supreme Court, then, was whether the administration could be required to pay the full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the multiple and varied USDA guidance memos to states stemming from the court actions, a number of states sent either full or partial November benefits to their residents. At least 16 states have provided beneficiaries with their full allotments for the month, and another five states have sent partial payments, according to a CNN tally.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in government funding.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The nonprofit groups challenging President Donald Trump raced back to US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island last week to argue that the court should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. The administration quickly appealed to the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, who handles emergency appeals from the 1st Circuit, issued what’s known as an “administrative stay” on Friday, effectively putting McConnell’s order on hold for a few days so lower courts could review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s emergency order was set to expire a few minutes before midnight on Tuesday. The justice did not explain her decision to dissent from the court’s extension.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/cleto-escobedo-iii-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-05:00","title":"Cleto Escobedo III, Jimmy Kimmel’s bandleader and childhood friend, dies at 59","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleto Escobedo III, the saxophonist and bandleader for Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!', died at the age of 59.

Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other.\n \n\n   \n  “We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we’ve been pals ever since,” Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University’s Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire’s Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n \n\n   \n  “Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,” Kimmel told WABC in 2015. “And there’s nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, on Escobedo’s 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom’s car.\n \n\n   \n  “Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,” Kimmel recalled.\n \n\n   \n  News of Escobedo’s death comes after Thursday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show’s guests. The date and cause of Escobedo’s death weren’t immediately known.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.\n \n\n   \n  “Jimmy asked me, ‘Who are we going to get in the band?’ I said, ‘Well, my normal guys,’ and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I’d invite him to gigs, and if he didn’t have anything to do he’d come check it out, so he knew my guys,” Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. “Then he just said, ‘Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn’t that be kind of cool?’ I was like, ‘That would be way cool.’”\n \n\n   \n  In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.\n \n\n   \n  “Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it’s more of a young man’s game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I’ve learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they’re babies; you come back and then they’re talking, it’s like, ‘What?’” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:39 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of  Israeli  settlers launched an arson attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress is passing a bipartisan funding bill to end a prolonged federal government shutdown, with the House set to vote on Wednesday after the Senate approved it.

federal government? \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:45 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Congress is  moving quickly  to pass a funding package that would end the longest federal shutdown in the nation’s history.\n \n\n   \n  The House is set to vote on Wednesday on a compromise bill after the  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the legislation extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement with Republicans does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the bill, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The bill would provide funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions would continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The legislation would fully fund the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The deal would also replenish SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund would also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many have missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that would require the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/byheart-baby-formula-recall-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:32:00-05:00","title":"ByHeart Recalls All Baby Formula in U.S. Amid Infant Botulism Outbreak Investigation","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"ByHeart, a U.S. baby formula company, has issued a nationwide recall of all its infant formula products after the FDA and CDC identified a possible link between its Whole Nutrition formula and a multistate outbreak of infant botulism.

investigation \n       \n  By Jacqueline Howard, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:32 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The baby formula company  ByHeart said Tuesday  that it has recalled all of its infant formula products nationwide, including cans and single-serve sticks.\n \n\n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating a  multistate outbreak of infant botulism  that may be tied to ByHeart’s “whole nutrition” infant formula products.\n \n\n   \n  Epidemiologic and laboratory data has shown that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, the germ that causes botulism, the FDA said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  According to the FDA, as of Monday, 15 children with suspected or confirmed infant botulism who had also been exposed to ByHeart infant formula have been  reported in 12 states : Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  All 15 infants, who ranged in age from 16 days to 157 days, were hospitalized and given  BabyBIG , an intravenous antibody treatment for infant botulism. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism happens when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum   spores, which can grow in the gut and produce botulinum neurotoxin,  according to the CDC . Signs and symptoms – which can take several weeks to develop – may include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing and a weak and altered cry, which can progress to difficulty breathing and respiratory arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Since August, 84 infants have received treatment for infant botulism nationwide, based on data from the California Department of Public Health’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, according to the FDA. Among those infants, 43% had been exposed to powdered infant formula. And among those who had powdered infant formula exposure, more than 40% consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula.\n \n\n   \n  “This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,” according to the  FDA . “Investigations remain ongoing but have not identified any other infant formula brands or shared exposures that pose a risk to infants.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘All ByHeart product must be discarded’\n \n\n   \n  Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the co-founders of ByHeart,  said in an online letter  Tuesday that they have provided the FDA with access to all of their facilities and products.\n \n\n   \n  “Upon learning about this outbreak on Friday evening, we immediately began conducting our own extensive testing on all ByHeart batches. Additionally, we are providing the FDA complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation, which has been done regularly at our owned facilities. We will share the results of our own testing as they become available,” Funt and Belldegrun wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “At this moment, the most important thing for you to know is that all ByHeart product must be discarded. We know that switching formulas is not an easy process or decision. We have resources to help,” they said, providing a link to a guide on  how to switch infant formulas . “We are so sorry, and are committed to doing anything we can to support you.”\n \n\n   \n  Several states are testing leftover formula, the FDA said, and the results are expected in the coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n   Preliminary lab results  that the California Department of Public Health released Saturday suggested that the bacterium that causes botulism was present in an open can of ByHeart infant formula, which was fed to an infant with botulism.\n \n\n   \n  “Infant botulism is a very rare disease that occurs when babies inhale or swallow spores of the toxin-producing bacteria that cause infant botulism, which leads to progressive muscle weakness including trouble breathing if not treated in time,” Dr. Erica Pan, California Department of Public Health’s director and state public health officer,  said in a news release  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have tested a sample of the specific powdered infant formula linked with these cases and preliminary tests are positive,” Pan said. “We are urging parents to stop using ByHeart formula immediately.”​\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive for Clostridium botulinum spores or toxin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/nba-mavericks-nico-harrison-fans","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Mavs fans wanted Nico Harrison fired.

Every Mavs fan knew the moment the trade happened that Nico would eventually be fired,” he said. “This still does not change that (owner Patrick) Dumont knows nothing about basketball. … Unless they bring Dirk (Nowitski, a franchise legend) back into the fold with an official position, preferably general manager, I will have no faith in Dumont or who he hires to make good decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Slovak’s frustration runs deeper than Harrison’s front-office record. He blamed ownership – the Dumonts and the Adelsons — for what he sees as a series of tone-deaf decisions that alienated fans.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s close to impossible to root for an organization that they own,” he said, adding that the only thing keeping him invested is  the potential of phenom Cooper Flagg. \n \n\n   \n     Hope and heartbreak \n \n\n   \n  For Skylar Alcala, who adored Dončić when he played on the Mavs, the firing brought an emotional mix of relief and lingering pain.\n \n\n   \n  “First initial reaction, THANK THE LORD!” she said. “With how the Mavs have started this season, I’m glad Dumont realized that what Nico did to this team was detrimental.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Alcala said the damage runs deep.\n \n\n   \n  “The way I feel about the Mavs now is still heartbreak. … There’s definitely a slight weight lifted off my shoulders knowing Nico is gone, but the Mavs organization has a-ways to go to build back trust,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  And the Dončić trade still stings: “The hardest part in all of this is seeing Luka dominate for the Lakers while we watch and wish every day for him to be back in a Mavs uniform.”\n \n\n   \n     A chance to heal – and rebuild \n \n\n   \n  John Tarrant – who, despite the Dončić trade, continued to cheer for the team and brings his sons to games – called the move long overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about time. The only person upset is Jerry Jones because he’s no longer the second-worst respected GM in DFW,” he quipped. “This organization and fan base needs to heal, and this is a first step.”\n \n\n   \n  Tarrant said fans are ready to move forward and build around young star Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  “Next steps need to happen. Anyone associated with Harrison’s tenure – including Anthony Davis – needs to be moved. Let’s rebuild this from the ground up around Flagg,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, he couldn’t hide his frustration at the trade that defined Harrison’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  “To trade a 25-year-old superstar for an injury-prone, aging veteran who has only played 14 of 46 games still makes zero sense,” Tarrant said. “Can Cuban buy back the team?”\n \n\n   \n     The bottom line \n \n\n   \n  The firing of Harrison may close one painful chapter, but the Mavericks’ front office faces immense pressure to get the next one right. Fans have made it clear: firing Harrison was a start – not a solution.\n \n\n   \n  As Slovak put it, “It’s not impossible to salvage the situation, but there’s been no indication over the last year that leadership is capable of making the decisions required to bring back the fans.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/fda-cder-pazdur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:24:00Z","title":"Longtime FDA Oncology Leader Named Agency’s Top Drug Regulator","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Richard Pazdur has been appointed as the new head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the agency’s largest division overseeing drug approvals and regulation.

flood victims file lawsuits claiming gross negligence after 27 girls and counselors died \n       \n  By Pamela Brown, Shoshana Dubnow, Holly Yan, Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:28 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The families of 13 girls and two counselors who died in the catastrophic flooding that swept through Camp Mystic this summer are suing the Texas camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence, according to four lawsuits filed this week.\n \n\n   \n  The flurry of litigation marks the first wave of legal action by victims’ families against the all-girls Christian camp since  25 girls and two counselors died  in the  July 4 disaster .\n \n\n   \n   Many of the youngest victims  were housed in the cabins closest to the Guadalupe River, which swelled to a deadly torrent amid epic rainfall and flooding. Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  One lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  A second lawsuit was filed by the family of 8-year-old Eloise “Lulu” Peck.\n \n\n   \n  A third was filed by the family of  9-year-old Ellen Getten .\n \n\n   \n  And a fourth was filed by the families of six other campers: Virginia Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane Hunt, Lucy Dillon and Kellyanne Lytal.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants in each lawsuit include Camp Mystic and members of the Eastland family, which owns the 99-year-old camp in Kerr County.\n \n\n   \n   “ Tragically, due to lack of planning, the absence of any evacuation plans, lack of training, inadequate warning systems, and other acts and omissions of recklessness and gross negligence, Plaintiffs’ daughters suffered terrifying, brutal, and horrific deaths,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.\n \n\n   \n  While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the lawsuits allege\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors claims Camp Mystic didn’t have adequate safety plans and prioritized money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.”\n \n\n   \n  On the morning of July 4, “the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp “chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp,” it continued. “Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  Another lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at  Bubble Inn cabin .\n \n\n   \n  The camp’s directors should have known about emergency alerts in the area before the calamitous flooding and should have been on “high alert,” the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  But there was no plan to evacuate campers until 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” the third lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of six girls slammed “Camp Mystic’s so-called ‘Emergency Instructions.’” A wrinkled copy of those instructions was found in a counselor’s flooded trunk.\n \n\n   \n  Under the “Floods” section, the instructions say “Campers and counselors NEVER wander away from your cabin” and “All cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”\n \n\n   \n  “Tragically, the last two sentences of Camp Mystic’s instructions caused the loss of Plaintiffs’ children’s lives,” that lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence. Further, to state that ‘[a]ll cabins are constructed on high, safe ground’ was patently false, misleading [and] created a false sense of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  Photos from inside one cabin show “the water rose so close to the ceiling (5 ¾ inches) [that] the girls ran out of air space and were tragically swept into the raging flood waters,” the lawsuit states. Eight-year-old Lucy “did not make it out of the cabin where she lost her life.”\n \n\n   \n  All four lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court and compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n  The first three lawsuits each seek more than $1 million in damages. The fourth suit does not specify an amount.\n \n\n   \n    The camp responds\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n  The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said, noting camp leaders helped evacuate 166 girls.\n \n\n   \n  But a photo in the lawsuit filed by the six families – which attorneys say was timestamped at 3:26 a.m. – showed some campers wading in floodwater to get to higher ground.\n \n\n   \n  Watts challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  next summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  The news stunned Steward, who still doesn’t know where her daughter is.\n \n\n   \n  “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter’s body,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/how-to-help-food-insecurity-iyw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00-05:00","title":"How to Help Those Facing Food Insecurity","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown, delays in SNAP benefits are causing severe food insecurity among millions of Americans, particularly low-income older adults.

At a time when the party base has lambasted Senate Democrats, who have been accused of “caving” to end the  weekslong shutdown , most of those to speak out have rejected the Senate deal.\n \n\n   \n  The  deal to end the shutdown  would fund the government through the end of January and offer a reprieve from layoffs for federal workers. Under the agreement, the Senate plans to vote on legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, Democrats’ main funding priority. The deal does not, however, guarantee a vote will happen in the House, which has become the main sticking point for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “If we knew we were going to get a vote in the House, I’d probably support this deal,” New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose district went for Trump by 5 points last year, said during a  radio interview  with Brian Lehrer on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leadership is encouraging members to vote against the Senate deal,  CNN has reported , and one centrist coalition within the party also opposes the agreement. The moderate New Democrat Coalition on Tuesday came out against the deal, a position that required approval from two-thirds of the group’s 116 members. Ten of the 13 Democrats in Trump districts are members of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what the 13 crossover district Democrats — based on lines drawn before  this year’s redistricting battles  — have said about the deal to end the government shutdown:\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Josh Harder of California\n \n\n   \n  Harder said he is a “hell no” on the deal in  an X video  his office posted Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t a deal at all,” he said. “It’s a surrender that is doing absolutely nothing to lower health care costs and premiums for millions of Californians.”\n \n\n   \n  Harder blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats who voted for the deal, calling it an “unacceptable” capitulation to the Trump administration, and said he would push to stop it in the House. Schumer publicly opposed the deal and voted against it.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York\n \n\n   \n  Suozzi told WNYC on Monday he wasn’t ready to endorse the Senate deal because it doesn’t guarantee a vote in the House to address the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. Like many Democrats opposed to the funding bill, Suozzi said he was worried the Senate might pass a measure to address the expiring tax credits, only for the House not to take it up.\n \n\n   \n  “That would be a real kick in the head,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Nellie Pou of New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Pou called the agreement a “bad deal” in  a statement on X  and said she would oppose any measure that doesn’t extend the premium tax credits.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be voting no to any so-called government funding package that will not stop Republican price hikes on health care premiums,” Pou said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan\n \n\n   \n  McDonald Rivet said she’s opposed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently need a bipartisan budget with real solutions to fix these costs and open the government,” she  said in a statement on X . “I remain ready to work on it, but caving without health care solutions would fail countless working families who are struggling to get by.”\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio\n \n\n   \n  The Ohio lawmaker  told Spectrum News  that she will not vote for the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s at stake are the health insurance bills and the cost of health insurance for millions and millions of Americans and their families, and we cannot take their benefits away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    The other lawmakers\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina  wrote on X  that he is reviewing the deal and is focused on “ending the government shutdown responsibly and addressing the high cost of living families are facing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat, expressed concerns about the funding bill  to a local ABC affiliate , saying the deal “doesn’t get anywhere close” to resolving premium increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t help to fix the health care crisis that we are facing, not just in New Mexico but across the country,” Vasquez said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to spokespeople for Reps.

to leave Chicago as early as this week, sources say \n       \n  By Priscilla Alvarez, Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:58 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in cities, along with his agents, are planning to leave Chicago as early as this week as they eye other locations to ramp up arrests, according to three US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino  has become the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there — first in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his officers are expected to head to Charlotte, North Carolina, then continue to New Orleans, according to two of the officials, who stressed plans are still being finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office “has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began. CBS News first  reported  Bovino planned to leave Chicago soon.\n \n\n   \n    Potential move comes after personal rebuke from judge\n \n\n   \n  The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally  called out  by a federal judge.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, “unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.”\n \n\n   \n  That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is  appealing  the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be  delayed  while an appeals court panel considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were “violent rioters and assaultive subjects.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a “reportable use of force” because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. “In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    President has publicly discussed other cities for operations\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  While Bovino and his team’s relocation is not yet final, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the news Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Greg Bovino’s legacy in Chicago is chaos, criminality, and terror,” Johnson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the grassroots resistance to Bovino that has forced them to retreat,” the mayor added. “Bovino did nothing to make our city safer. He will not be missed in Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  “This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety — this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets,” said a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Dianne Gallagher and Danya Gainor contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/nfl-donald-trump-kickoffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:59:00-05:00","title":"Donald Trump Really, Really Doesn’t Like the NFL’s New Kickoff Format","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump criticized the NFL’s new dynamic kickoff format during a live appearance on Pat McAfee’s ESPN show, calling it 'terrible,' 'demeaning,' and unromantic, arguing it undermines the spirit and pageantry of football.

like the NFL’s new kickoff format \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:59 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump called into Pat McAfee’s show on ESPN on Tuesday, discussing his admiration for the nation’s veterans on Veterans Day, the impending end of the government shutdown, the role of sports in his political life and the big money in college sports.\n \n\n   \n  But there was one topic that really got the president fired up:  The NFL’s new kickoff format. \n \n\n   \n  “I  hate  the kickoff,” Trump said to protestations from McAfee.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so demeaning, and I think it hurts the game. It hurts the pageantry. I’ve told that to Roger Goodell, and I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other, and … it’s the opposite of what the game (is supposed to be). The ball is in the air, and nobody’s moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to move.\n \n\n   \n  “You walk in and the pageantry of the game is so badly hurt. And I don’t think NFL, you know, they don’t, they do what they want to do, but I don’t think they’ll change.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been a frequent critic of the NFL’s revamped kickoff format, adopted for the first time last season in an effort to decrease the intense collisions that frequently resulted in injuries.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the league for comment on Trump’s latest criticism on the so-called dynamic kickoff.\n \n\n   \n  Under the old rules, the kicking team started at its 35-yard line and tried to kick the ball as far downfield as possible to give their defense a better chance of stopping the offense far from the end zone. Meanwhile, the receiving team tries to move the ball as far as they can up the field. With two teams running at each other at top speed, collisions between players were often devastating.\n \n\n   \n  The new version still sees the ball kicked from the kicking team’s 35-yard line, but every player on the kicking team other than the kicker himself now lines up with at least one foot on the returning team’s 40-yard line.\n \n\n   \n  Players must also wait to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20-yard line. Any kick that is caught or lands in the landing zone must be returned, while any kick that falls short of the landing zone will be ruled a touchback and spotted at the returning team’s 40-yard line. If a kick hits the landing zone and then goes into the end zone, it has to be returned or downed by the receiving team.\n \n\n   \n  Among other things, it basically means players are closer together and are not colliding into each other with as much speed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has complained about the rule almost since it first debuted. But on Tuesday, he went even further with his lamentations.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope college football doesn’t change, because the power of the kickoff is, we’re so beautiful, and now it, you know, I don’t want to say what it reminds me of, because I’ll get myself into big trouble,” Trump said. “It is not football, and I have no idea what you guys – you guys may disagree with me. I don’t think it’s going to help.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so bad. It’s so bad. It’s so unromantic, and it just is demeaning to football. I don’t think they have a right to do that to the game,” Trump went on to say. “You know, the game is so important. I don’t think the people that approve that. I don’t think anybody has the right to do that to the game. And I hope college doesn’t change, and I hope that someday the NFL will stop it and go back to football.”\n \n\n   \n  The league has maintained that the new system is safer than the old and also results in more exciting plays.\n \n\n   \n  Kickoffs have long been one of the most dangerous plays in the game and were four times more likely to cause a concussion than a play that involved running or passing, according to  data  from the NFL. Since the change in format, the league has been buoyed by the early results.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the NFL  published data  from the 2024 season that showed a “significant decrease in concussions.” As intended, the new rule slowed average player speeds, which led to a lower concussion rate – down 43% from 2021-2023.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL said returns increased 57% in the 2024 regular season and that there were seven kickoffs returned for touchdowns – the most since 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, told CNN that the new rule makes the game safer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been an overwhelming success,” Sills said.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Last year, if you look at our data, significantly higher return rate but the injury rate was one of the lowest that we’ve seen. So, that was what we were looking for with the play, is to make it more exciting yet also safer. So, we looked at space and speed. It went down, which is what we expected from the play. We, again, saw more excitement. And here’s an unexpected benefit: Because the average starting point for drives was further out, closer to the 30-yard line, we had fewer punts, which is also good from a health and safety standpoint because pun is one of our more injurious plays.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:35:00Z","title":"Former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik to Face Probe Over Online Comments About Rival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is under investigation by FIDE for bullying and harassment stemming from repeated, unsubstantiated accusations of cheating against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died unexpectedly at age 29.

29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that.

We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator.

pile up in the eastern Great Lakes from a brief bout of Arctic air gripping the eastern US.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen cities, reaching as far south as Fort Myers, Miami and Naples, Florida, toppled or tied daily record lows for November 11.\n \n\n   \n  This morning is the coldest so early in the fall since 1976 in Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, with both locations dropping to a shivering 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The cold is causing South Florida’s cold-blooded iguanas to “freeze,” or lose muscle control. They can sometimes fall out of trees as a result, which some Floridians saw Tuesday morning. The iguanas are not dead, but rather in a paralyzed state and can revive if temperatures warm up fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  Cold conditions farther north have kicked the lake-effect snow machine into gear across the Great Lakes for the first time this year. Snow will contribute to dangerous travel conditions on Tuesday in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest snow has come to an end in the western Great Lakes. Up to a foot of snow fell more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  Chicago only picked up 1 to 3 inches of snow, which was accompanied by thunder and strong winds Sunday night into early Monday. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potentially historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are. That’s what happened Monday near Lake Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, over a foot of snow fell in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Several inches of snow have also piled up in the Appalachians from West Virginia to the border between North Carolina and Tennessee since Monday. Knoxville, Tennessee, saw its earliest accumulating snow since 1996 on Monday,  according to the National Weather Service . Snowflakes have flown through the air as far south as the Atlanta metro area on Monday, and along the North Carolina coast in Wilmington on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n    A temperature turnaround is ahead\n \n\n   \n  The good news: This cold snap won’t stick around long.\n \n\n   \n  Temperatures across the central and southern US will rebound quickly in the second half of this week as Arctic air releases its grip and warmer winds from out of the south return. Highs will be as much as 10 to 25 degrees above average from the Plains into the Midwest by Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A few cities in the Midwest that just saw their first snowflakes of the season could flirt with daily record high temperatures on Saturday. That includes Dubuque, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois, where thermometers are predicted to climb to near 70 degrees as the weekend begins.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the South will also return to shorts and T-shirt weather in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Highs in the lower 70s return to Nashville, Tennessee, by Friday, which is about 10 degrees above average. Much of the Florida Peninsula will see thermometers reach the upper 70s and lower 80s heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone in the East will feel this warmup.

son-in-law Kushner \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:51 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Thousands of protesters in Serbia symbolically formed a human shield Tuesday around a bombed-out military complex, vowing to protect it from redevelopment as a luxury compound by a company linked to US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n \n\n   \n  Youth-led protesters drew a red line as they encircled the sprawling buildings in the capital, Belgrade that were partially destroyed in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign. The site faces demolition and redevelopment under a plan backed by the populist government of  President Aleksandar Vucic .\n \n\n   \n  The $500-million project to build a high-rise hotel, offices and shops at the site has met fierce opposition from experts at home and abroad, as well as the Serbian public. But last week Serbian lawmakers passed a special law clearing the way for the construction despite legal hurdles.\n \n\n   \n  Vucic’s pro-Trump government says the project would boost the economy and ties with the US administration, which has imposed tariffs of 35% on imports from Serbia. It has also sanctioned Serbia’s monopoly oil supplier, which is controlled by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, critics say the building is an architectural monument, seen as a symbol of resistance to the US-led NATO bombing that remains widely viewed in the Balkan country as an unjust “aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Serbia’s government last year stripped the complex of protected status and signed a 99-year-lease agreement with Kushner-related Affinity Global Development in the US. But the redevelopment project came into question after Serbia’s organized crime prosecutors launched an investigation into whether documents used to remove that status were forged.\n \n\n   \n  The buildings are seen as prime examples of mid-20th century architecture in the former Yugoslavia. The protesters demanded that the protected heritage status for the complex be restored, and the buildings rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a warning that we will all defend these buildings together,” one of the students said. “We will be the human shield.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue has become the latest flashpoint in yearlong street protests that have shaken Vucic’s firm grip on power. Protesters have accused his government of rampant corruption in state projects. The protests started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad after renovation, killing 16 people.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of people marked the tragedy’s anniversary on Nov. 1 in Novi Sad.\n \n\n   \n  Serbia was bombed in 1999 for 78 days to force then-President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Anti-NATO sentiment remain strong in Serbia, and the US role in revamping the military buildings is particularly sensitive among many Serbians.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the government in Albania, another Balkan country, approved a $1.6 billion plan from Kushner’s company for a project to develop a luxury resort on a communist-era fortified island on the Adriatic coast.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-military-mobilization-us-buildup-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:47:00Z","title":"Venezuela announces ‘massive mobilization’ of military forces as America’s largest warship sails into region","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela has launched a 'massive mobilization' of its military forces, including land, air, naval, and reserve units, in response to a significant U.S. military build-up in the Caribbean.

He even called them a “con job by Democrats” and said the “polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Biden and his administration made a series of wayward predictions and comments about just how significant a problem inflation would prove to be. And they wound up paying a significant political price for their economic Pollyanna act.\n \n\n   \n  But the situations aren’t that analogous.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump has gone much further in his attempts to bury his head in the sand. And he seems to have a bigger problem politically speaking, for several reasons.\n \n\n   \n  No, the economy isn’t necessarily worse under Trump than it was under Biden. But Trump seems to have turned it into a bigger political liability.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration’s sins on this front were largely in its failure to recognize or convey how stubborn a problem inflation would be. Administration officials repeatedly and infamously used words like “transitory,” suggesting the problem would soon go away.\n \n\n   \n  “We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we’ve seen some price increases,” Biden  said in July 2021 . “Some folks have raised worries that could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that’s not our view.”\n \n\n   \n  Their view was wrong. The annual inflation rate climbed from about 5% when Biden made those remarks all the way over 9% about a year later. In the intervening months, the administration effectively  acknowledged its error .\n \n\n   \n  Trump, by contrast, isn’t just downplaying inflation or donning glasses that seem a couple of shades too rosy; he’s pretending the problem simply doesn’t exist.\n \n\n   \n  That escalated Monday when he was pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether Americans were right to be feeling the economic pinch. Trump basically suggested it was much ado about nothing.\n \n\n   \n  “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When Ingraham pointed to polls that show Americans are quite anxious about the economy, the president responded: “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote a good rundown Monday of Trump’s  nonstop string of lies  about this subject – lies that he repeated in the same Fox interview even as he accused others of misinformation. Trump has misstated a bevy of economic data points, including on inflation, grocery prices, energy prices and prescription drug prices. He keeps saying things like that there is no inflation or that grocery prices are down.\n \n\n   \n  (Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, claimed Monday when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that Trump merely meant  inflation  was down, rather than prices. But that’s not what Trump has said. And as Dale notes, inflation is not down.)\n \n\n   \n  Biden’s gamble was that his and his administration’s predictions could turn out to be wrong, which they did.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s gamble is that if he can’t convince people of his alternate version of reality, he risks looking completely out of touch.\n \n\n   \n  Which brings us to the other major difference with Biden.\n \n\n   \n  There is no question that inflation and the economy were political problems for the Democratic president; they likely helped deliver Trump the White House in 2024. But they appear to be even bigger political problems for Trump now.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are more likely to tie economic problems to Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  A number of recent polls have shown this:\n \n\n   \n  And despite Trump’s and his administration’s attempts to blame Biden for continuing economic pains, polls suggest Americans aren’t about to buy into that.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll  as far back as May showed that if the country were to fall into a recession, 59% of Americans would blame Trump, versus just 37% who would blame Biden.\n \n\n   \n  So why might Americans be more likely to attach economic pains to Trump than they did to Biden?\n \n\n   \n  There are a number of possible reasons.\n \n\n   \n  One is that Trump  pledged over and over to bring prices down quickly , and he clearly hasn’t done that.\n \n\n   \n  Another is that Biden might have benefited from Americans blaming at least some of the economic problems on the Covid-19 pandemic – which rocked the economy worldwide – rather than his policies.\n \n\n   \n  Another could be that Trump voluntarily took ownership of an already dicey economy by launching tariffs very early in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  But arguably the biggest reason is that Americans just haven’t seen Trump take on this issue head-on. CBS polling shows as many 75% of Americans say the Trump administration has focused “not enough” on lowering prices. That includes 57% of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  (At least Biden was doing things like getting Congress to pass a bill called the “Inflation Reduction Act” – regardless of whether it actually helped with inflation.)\n \n\n   \n  One way for Trump to respond to this data would be to double down on making affordability his focus. Another is to pretend 75% of Americans simply don’t know what they’re talking about or that the number is “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has apparently chosen the latter. It’s difficult to see how those around him would see it as their best option.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/secret-lives-mormon-wives-season-3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Strap in because 'The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' is bringing even more drama this season","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Season 3 of 'The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' returns with heightened drama, including allegations of infidelity involving Jessi Ngatikaura and tension between her and Demi Engemann.

 \nUpdated: \n        2:32 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Things are heating up again in Utah.\n \n\n   \n  “The  Secret Lives of Mormon Wives ” is returning for its third season, which unfolds in some different locations (no spoilers here) but lacks absolutely no drama as the women try to balance personal relationships, work opportunities and the unique dynamics of being reality stars.\n \n\n   \n  The series began in 2024 thanks to Taylor Frankie Paul, who found scandal in 2022, when she announced via TikTok that she was getting divorced after she said she violated the terms of her open marriage. She also shared that she and her now ex-husband Tate had participated in “soft swinging” with other couples in their Utah community, which involved trading sexual partners in their social circle.\n \n\n   \n  Paul is credited with forming “MomTok” by pulling together a group of fellow Mormon mothers on TikTok. Many of the members have millions of followers, sharing glimpses into their lives for lucrative sponsorships.\n \n\n   \n  The first season of “Mormon Wives” last year focused on the fallout from Paul’s scandalous revelation, as well as her subsequent pregnancy with boyfriend Dakota Mortensen, with whom she became involved while married.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward Season 3, and lots has changed as viewers witnessed the toxicity between Paul and Mortensen over the past two seasons and the recent announcement that she  is the next Bachelorette. \n \n\n   \n  Paul’s fellow cast members Layla Taylor and Miranda McWhorter offered support in her attempt to find love on another reality show.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Taylor deserves to find an actual pure example of love in somebody that respects her in and out of the room that she’s in,” Taylor said. “I feel like Taylor’s (Frankie Paul) just deserving of that. So we’re excited. We’re so excited.”\n \n\n   \n  McWhorter agreed, which means something as she and her now ex-husband Chase were a big part of the “soft swinging” scandal that kicked the show off. She told CNN, “You gotta be okay with whatever skeletons you got in that closet coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have to authentic and open and real about everything. I think the more reserved you are this might not be for you. And it’s hard,” McWhorter said. “This is a hard world to be in. You have people that are judging you off of how you handle situations, off of how you operate. And it’s hard because people are only seeing such small glimpses into who you are as a person.”\n \n\n   \n  New “Bachelorette” Paul is not the only one who has gotten a reality crossover.\n \n\n   \n  Cast members Jennifer Affleck and Whitney Leavitt were selected to compete on the most recent season of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck spoke with CNN soon after she was eliminated from the dance competition.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely a different vibe and it’s a different hard because with the ‘Secret Lives’ it can be very draining in the sense that there’s a lot of drama and it’s uncomfortable in that sense,” Affleck said. “But ‘Dancing With the Stars’ is uncomfortable in the sense that it’s not only mentally demanding, but also it’s very physical.”\n \n\n   \n  She said she loved how positive “DWTS” was because “everyone tries to stray away from drama and that was kind of nice for me to be able to be on a reality TV show that doesn’t fixate on drama.”\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 also includes the heightened drama of finding out what really happened regarding allegations of Jessi Ngatikaura being unfaithful to her husband and the unraveling of her and some of the other women’s relationship with Demi Engemann, who has had tension with more than a few of them.\n \n\n   \n  Ngatikaura admitted to having “all the emotions” about her personal life playing out on air.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m nervous clearly, because it’s a big story to share and I have no idea what the opinions will be,” she told CNN. “But I’m also relieved that it’ll be out there because it’s kind of been like a secret and no one’s known my dynamic and what happened in my relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  “So at least it’ll be out there and I can talk about it openly, but I have no idea what the audience is going to feel,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” debuts Thursday on Hulu.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:29:00Z","title":"India on edge after deadly car explosion in capital region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car explosion occurred near the historic Red Fort in Delhi, India, on November 11, 2025, killing at least 10 people and injuring over 30.

The area, a major tourist hub known for its crowded bazaars and street vendors, was immediately thrown into chaos.\n \n\n   \n  The incident, a rare occurrence for the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people, unleashed a scene of devastation in the heart of Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the aftermath showed thick, orange flames billowing into the pitch-black sky, vehicles twisted and charred from the blast and victims strewn across the street.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of the blast is not yet known, and the Indian government has yet to blame any specific group. Comments from top government officials on Tuesday have begun to suggest the act was a deliberate one.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from Bhutan, where he is on a visit, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “horrific incident” in Delhi “has deeply saddened everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy,” he said in Hindi, before breaking out into English: “All those responsible will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s defense minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the “findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The National Investigation Agency (NIA), India’s principal counter-terrorism law enforcement agency, is now handling the case.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time, Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said.\n \n\n   \n  At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi’s deputy fire chief.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time, Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard a big sound. Our windows shook,” one resident who did not give a name told Indian broadcaster NDTV, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  An ambulance driver said he could “only find bodies” when they reached the site of the blast.\n \n\n   \n  “The bodies were in parts, and we had to pick different parts and bring them back in the ambulances, and later brought them to the hospital,” he told local news agency ANI.\n \n\n   \n  One man said his nephew, an e-rickshaw driver, died in the blast. His family tried calling him late Monday but couldn’t get through.\n \n\n   \n  “When we came here, we had to identify the body,” he told ANI.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of the casualties could be seen weeping outside a local hospital.\n \n\n   \n    India on edge\n \n\n   \n  The ripple effect from Monday’s blast has been felt across India.\n \n\n   \n  Airports, railway stations, government buildings and heritage sites across the country have been put on high alert, according to the Central Industrial Security Force, and the Red Fort will remain  closed  for three days as the investigation continues. The US embassy in New Delhi is advising Americans to avoid the surrounding area as well as large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  The states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which neighbors Delhi, has also been put on high alert, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  Security arrangements “of important establishments, religious sites, crowded places, and other sensitive points” will be reviewed, Uttar Pradesh police  wrote  on X. The state, India’s most populous, is home to the Taj Mahal and other major tourist attractions.\n \n\n   \n  Haryana’s head of police, OP Singh, urged residents to “remain calm” and report any “suspicious person or unclaimed object” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The northwestern state of Rajasthan is also on high alert, its police department  said  on X.\n \n\n   \n  In the financial capital of Mumbai, train stations have been put on high alert, Reuters reported, citing authorities.\n \n\n   \n    Historic monument\n \n\n   \n  The Red Fort stands as one of India’s most significant historical landmarks.\n \n\n   \n  Originally built by Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace-fort of his capital, it served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.

12:45 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who has been held by US federal immigration for over two weeks, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The London-based journalist and commentator, who was visiting the United States on a speaking tour,  was detained  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month as he went through San Francisco International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. But Muslim advocacy groups say that his visa was revoked during his trip without cause or prior notice. Hamdi’s family believe his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories was the real reason behind the decision.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Hamdi had opted to accept a US government offer to leave the country voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  “The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country” in a statement Monday. McLaughlin characterized Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE records show Hamdi was still in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer on Monday welcomed the US decision to release the British national.\n \n\n   \n  “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said she was optimistic her husband would be home before the end of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We as a family are enormously relieved that our beloved Sami will soon be returning home, after the US government agreed to release him voluntarily, with no order of deportation and no allegations,” she told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV.  He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation.

months rebelling against the man who traded Luka Dončić. The team just fired the embattled GM \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:33 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Dallas Mavericks fired general manager Nico Harrison on Tuesday, dismissing  the man who traded away fan-favorite Luka Dončić  in one of the most shocking NBA trades in recent memory.\n \n\n   \n  Mavs fans essentially rebelled against Harrison in the months after the early February trade, chanting, “Fire Nico!” at every opportunity. Harrison became something akin to Public Enemy No. 1 in Dallas, even after lucking into the top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft and drafting Duke star Cooper Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to fans, owner Patrick Dumont said the current state of the organization is not in line with the expectations fans have set for the Mavs.\n \n\n   \n  “No one associated with the Mavericks organization is happy with the start of what we all believed would be a promising season,” Dumont wrote. “You have high expectations for the Mavericks, and I share them with you. When the results don’t meet expectations, it’s my responsibility to act. I’ve made the decision to part ways with General Manager Nico Harrison.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “I know our players are deeply committed to a winning culture, this decision was critical to moving our franchise forward in a positive direction.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization announced Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi will serve as co-interim general managers while a permanent replacement is sought.\n \n\n   \n  The Dončić trade ended up ushering in one of the bleakest stretches for any NBA team in recent memory.  On February 1,  the Mavericks sent Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers’ 2029 first-round draft pick.\n \n\n   \n   In the period after the deal , the Mavericks went 14-21, lost Anthony Davis – the main player Dallas received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. Davis returned as the Mavs tried to win a spot in the NBA playoffs through the play-in round but ultimately fell short.\n \n\n   \n  During that entire time, the fans demanded Harrison be fired and pundits declared that the Mavericks had just made a potentially franchise killing move. Dončić is just 26 years old, led the team to the NBA Finals in the 2023-24 season, had been named All-NBA each year he had been in the league and was entering his prime. All reporting around the deal indicated that Dončić never planned to leave Dallas, and his emotional return to Texas in  April indicated that the pain of the surprise move still pained him.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old  told ESPN  that he threw and cracked his phone when he first heard about the trade, adding that he felt “sadness mostly” and that he “felt like my heart was broken, honestly.”\n \n\n   \n   In his end-of-season news conference,  Harrison said he was surprised by the city’s depth of feeling for Dončić.\n \n\n   \n  “I did know that Luka was important to the fanbase,” Harrison told reporters during his season-ending news conference. “I didn’t quite know to what level.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Harrison remained staunch in his belief that Dallas has the makings of a winning team despite the trade and fan backlash.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that’s a championship-caliber team and we would have been winning at a high level and that would have quieted some of the outrage,” Harrison said, adding that being healthy is the only thing keeping the team from challenging for a title. “And so unfortunately we weren’t able to do that, so it just continued to go on and on.”\n \n\n   \n  But how the franchise handled the Dončić trade and its immediate aftermath sealed Harrison’s fate in the minds of many Mavs fans.\n \n\n   \n  One of the things that particularly irked fans was a report after the trade that slammed Dončić’s conditioning, with  ESPN  citing sources inside the franchise revealing frustration with his diet. The treatment of a player who was widely revered as an icon in Dallas, especially less than a year after an NBA Finals appearance, went over like a ton of bricks.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone wants to point at Luka’s flaws, at least for a half-second,” Mavs fan Matthew Slovak told CNN. “The overwhelming narrative is that this is the most ridiculous thing ever, but there was that, ‘Yeah, but.’ There is no ‘yeah, but.’ – this is the most indefensible trade of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  In his letter, Dumont emphasized that he understood the frustrations of the fans.\n \n\n   \n  “I understand the profound impact these difficult last several months have had. Please know that I’m fully committed to the success of the Mavericks,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you for your support, thank you for holding us accountable, and thank you for your passion and for your patience. You deserve transparency and a team that reflects your spirit. Our goal is to return winning basketball to Dallas and win championships. Our family is committed to that mission and to continuing to invest in Dallas and the Mavericks’ future.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ben Morse and Andy Scholes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/world/blast-islamabad-pakistan-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"22:42:00-05:00","title":"At Least 12 Killed in Islamabad Suicide Attack – the Most Deadly Assault in the Pakistani Capital Since 2008","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A suicide bombing in Islamabad’s judicial complex killed 12 people and injured over 20, marking the deadliest such attack in the capital in nearly two decades.

killed in Islamabad suicide attack – the most deadly assault in the Pakistani capital since 2008 \n       \n  By Sophia Saifi and Azaz Syed, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:42 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A bombing in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad on Tuesday killed 12 people and injured more than 20 – marking the worst suicide attack to rock the city in nearly two decades.\n \n\n   \n  Wreaths of gray smoke and orange flames curled over a car in the capital, in a video of the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a faction of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement seen by CNN. The JuA has been behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan in the past decade. However, the TTP distanced itself from the attack, according to the group’s spokesman Mohammad Khurasani.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s president Asif Ali Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide blast” near the city’s High Court on Tuesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Islamabad requires a high level of security to enter and exit the city with specific security zones throughout the capital. The explosion took place in the parking lot of the city’s busy judicial complex in a district full of high-ranking government offices.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities located CCTV footage showing a man loitering around the courts having attempted to enter the building – before carrying out the attack, according to Mohsin Naqvi, the Pakistani interior minister.\n \n\n   \n  “He was waiting, but when the police car approached that’s when he carried out the attack,” Naqvi told reporters on Tuesday. “Everyone who enters the court is checked by security and since he was unable to do so, he attacked the police car. We have all the CCTV footage.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the   deadliest suicide attack in the Pakistani capital in close to two decades. The last major attack was in 2008 when a suicide attack by a militant Islamist group at the city’s Marriott hotel killed 54 people.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in Islamist violence since the Afghan Taliban swept Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  Without providing evidence, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif foisted blame upon “Indian terrorist proxies” on Tuesday, claiming that other recent militant attacks in the country were “being carried out from Afghan soil and backed by India.”\n \n\n   \n  Delhi rejected “the baseless and unfounded allegations” in a statement on Tuesday, accusing Islamabad of fomenting “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India in order to deflect the attention of its own public from the ongoing military-inspired constitutional subversion and power-grab unfolding within the country,” added India’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  The comments come months after India and Pakistan engaged in the most intense fighting in decades, which saw four days of escalating conflict in May that included fighter jets, missiles, and drones packed with explosives.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I saw 40 people fall immediately’\n \n\n   \n  Manzar Abbas lay on a red and white hospital bed in Islamabad on Tuesday, his bloodied leg strapped with a thick bandage.\n \n\n   \n  The 32-year-old PhD student was near a police station close to the courts, when tens of residents immediately hit the ground following the blast. Then, in a split second, a security guard helped him get to hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was passing the police station close to the courts, I saw the police car pass me and I saw a man go towards it wearing his jacket,” Abbas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw about 40 people fall immediately,” he added. “I had been hit as well and bled a lot. But thank goodness I was saved.”\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif stated on X that Pakistan is in a “state of war” and that this attack should be taken as a “wake-up call” with regards to negotiations with neighboring Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “The rulers of Kabul can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which—praise be to God—Pakistan has the full strength to respond,” the Pakistani defense minister added.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement expressing “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding both the attack in Islamabad as well as the attack on the cadet college in the country’s northwest. The statement from Afghanistan did not address the remarks of Pakistan’s defence minister.\n \n\n   \n  Both the embassies of China and the United States condemned the attack. The US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said in a statement that “the United States stands in solidarity with Pakistan in the struggle against terrorism.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his condolences to the victims’ families and called for a full investigation, his spokesman said.\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between the Pakistani and Afghan militaries in October saw the worst violence between the two countries in years.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to maintain a ceasefire fell apart when peace talks between the two neighbors failed in Istanbul last week following the failure to establish a long-term deal regarding hostile militant groups in Afghanistan that operate against Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion came  less than a day after militants attacked a cadet college in northwestern Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/sonder-bankruptcy-marriott-deal-ends","dateOfPublication":"1111-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-05:00","title":"Collapse of Sonder, a Marriott-backed hotel chain, leaves guests stranded mid-stay","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sonder, a short-term rental company once valued at $1 billion and a major Airbnb rival, collapsed due to severe financial constraints after failing to meet the terms of its 20-year licensing agreement with Marriott.

That’s because Sonder’s licensing agreement with Marriott was “no longer in effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the staff if we could still stay until our checkout at 11 am, but the staff explained he had only received instructions to empty the building ASAP and that unfortunately we only had 10 to 15 minutes,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust is just one of the many travelers affected by Sonder’s shutdown following the sudden end of a deal with Marriott, which had let guests book and earn loyalty points at Sonder’s 9,000 furnished apartments and boutique hotel rooms in 40 cities across 10 countries.\n \n\n   \n  Marriott said in a  statement  Sunday that the planned 20-year licensing agreement had ended because of Sonder’s “default,” a.k.a. financial difficulties.\n \n\n   \n  The 2024 deal should’ve had been a boon for Sonder, which was  once valued at $1 billion  and considered a major Airbnb rival. Sonder sought to strike the sweet spot between a hotel and an Airbnb, offering guests the convenience of an all-digital check-in experience but for smaller properties ideal for solo travelers. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and a rough go in the  public markets  in 2022 ultimately spelled its doom. Sonder was relying on the strength of Marriott’s booking platform to give it a much-needed boost.\n \n\n   \n  Sonder said in a statement Monday that it’s “winding down operations immediately” and entering Chapter 7, a complete liquidation of its business. The company blamed “severe financial constraints arising from, among other things, prolonged challenges in the integration of the company’s systems and booking arrangements with Marriott.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories of guests being stranded mid-stay at Sonder properties are  littered  across social media, mostly putting the blame on Marriott. A Marriott spokesperson told CNN that it’s worked “tirelessly to remain informed about Sonder’s financial situation and develop action plans so that we can work to meet the needs of our guests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Marriott is in communication with guests who have existing reservations at Sonder properties booked on Marriott.com and through other Marriott channels, and we are in contact with third-party platforms to communicate with guests who booked on other channels,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  For D’Aoust, that meant an early ending to his weekend away and a two-hour drive back home to Ottawa. But he’s thankful it was just one day lost, and he only missed out on a breakfast reservation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d imagine it’s a little more stressful for folks that had much longer stays,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/media/laura-ingraham-trump-fox-news-interview-maga","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:38:00-05:00","title":"‘MAGA backlash’: Laura Ingraham challenged Trump in a way few Fox hosts ever do","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a rare and pointed interview on Fox News, Laura Ingraham directly challenged President Donald Trump on key policy proposals, including economic perception, the 50-year mortgage plan proposed by Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, and the controversial student visa program for 600,000 Chinese college students.

backlash’: Laura Ingraham challenged Trump in a way few Fox hosts ever do \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:38 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Trump’s Fox News interviewers are sometimes so promotional and deferential that little gets challenged, and almost no news is ever made.\n \n\n   \n  However, Laura Ingraham was more strategic than that. On Monday, she sat down with Trump and scrutinized several of his policy proposals, channeling dissension within the pro-Trump ranks — and seemingly catching the president off guard.\n \n\n   \n  Sounding skeptical of Trump’s “costs are way down” defensiveness, the conservative Fox host asked, “Are you saying voters are misperceiving how they feel?”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham also asked about his stance on the government shutdown, his demolition of the East Wing, and his understanding of Christianity.\n \n\n   \n  After she brought up two issues of particular concern to her MAGA media allies, Trump said, “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea. I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham’s approach was in keeping with the tone of her nightly Fox show: She often tries to steer Trump in what she believes is a more productive, ultimately politically successful direction.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was elected in 2016, Ingraham held talks about becoming his press secretary, but she insisted on having a seat at the policymaking table as well. The transition team couldn’t agree on how to make room for her, and Sean Spicer was hired as press secretary instead.\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham has arguably been more influential on the outside, nudging Trump via the television, and occasionally in person.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s interview, when Trump tried to downplay the impacts of recent air travel chaos, she interjected: “There are a lot of delays now, sir.”\n \n\n   \n  She generally framed her questions in a positive light for the president, while still conveying the concerns of Republican voters.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Ingraham brought up voter anxiety about affordability, as seen in last week’s off-year election results. “I know you’ve been all over” the issue, she said, and some prices are “way down,” but “other things, as you noted, have gone up.”\n \n\n   \n  “Is this a voter perception issue of the economy,” she asked, “or is there more that needs to be done by Republicans on Capitol Hill or done in terms of policy?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested a perception problem, saying, “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n  But Ingraham wasn’t buying it. She said Joe Biden was criticized — including by Trump — for “saying things were great, and things weren’t great.”\n \n\n   \n  A little bit later on, she directly asked, “Why are people saying they’re anxious about the economy? Why are they saying that?” Trump rejected the premise of the question.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are” saying that, the president claimed. “I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also waved off Ingraham’s critical question about a recent proposal by Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte for 50-year mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  This idea “has enraged your MAGA friends,” Ingraham pointed out, describing the “significant MAGA backlash” from people who are “calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump didn’t want to hear it. Of the 50-year mortgage proposal, he said, “it’s not even a big deal. I mean, you know, you go from 40 to 50 years and—”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham corrected him: From “30 to 50” years.\n \n\n   \n  “All it means is, you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time,” Trump said. “It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit, but the problem was that Biden did this.”\n \n\n   \n  Then Trump went on to bash Biden some more.\n \n\n   \n  However, Ingraham was more interested in hearing the current president’s views about contentious topics.\n \n\n   \n  She broached conservative disdain for American colleges and universities and said “a lot of MAGA folks, um, are not thrilled about this idea of hundreds of thousands of foreign students in the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fox host specifically raised Trump’s plan to grant student visas for 600,000 Chinese college students, which Trump has justified as a business transaction.\n \n\n   \n  “I know you and I disagree” on this, he said to Ingraham. “We’re never gonna agree on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:35:00-05:00","title":"Trump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks.

What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:35 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Who qualifies and is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:15:00-05:00","title":"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As Venezuela faces renewed inflation and economic collapse, President Nicolás Maduro is under pressure from the United States, which has increased military presence and imposed sanctions on the country’s oil sector.

Venezuela’s streets \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:15 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing US  military pressure  and calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela’s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.\n \n\n   \n  “Prices are growing every day,” said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “Corn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,” Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to make  arepas,  the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.\n \n\n   \n  In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.\n \n\n   \n  In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n  The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.\n \n\n   \n  While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.\n \n\n   \n  This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.\n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”\n \n\n   \n  A typical breakfast of croissant and  café con leche  now can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.\n \n\n   \n  The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.\n \n\n   \n  “I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n    War on inflation, one detention at a time\n \n\n   \n  The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.\n \n\n   \n  The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.\n \n\n   \n  For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.\n \n\n   \n  Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.\n \n\n   \n    Several causes\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.\n \n\n   \n  For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.\n \n\n   \n  The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.\n \n\n   \n  In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Chevron said the company “operates globally in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the US government, including in Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The future is crypto\n \n\n   \n  To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:14:00-05:00","title":"Tracking States’ Unprecedented Redistricting Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have launched a major effort to redraw congressional district boundaries across the U.S., aiming to preserve their narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

 President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The latest development is in Utah, where a judge rejected a proposed map drawn by the state’s Republican legislature and  ordered the use of one  which is likely to create a Democratic seat. Utah had to create a new map after a ruling that the map drawn by the state legislature in 2021 violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store.

state that pioneered SNAP speak of hardship \n       \n  By René Marsh, Dianne Gallagher, Michael Williams, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:33 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Onita Norris is constantly running the numbers to try to solve a problem with no good answer: Figuring out much her two children, both under five, will have to eat, and how much she will have to go without.\n \n\n   \n  The West Virginia single mother earns about $2,800 a month working 40 hours weekly for the state. About half of that goes toward rent. The rest is for daycare and her electric, water and phone bills, leaving her only about $100 from her paycheck for other expenses, including groceries.\n \n\n   \n  Aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, usually adds $265 to her monthly budget for food. But with benefits disrupted  as the government lurches into what is now its longest shutdown on record, Norris now must find other ways to feed her family.\n \n\n   \n  “Rather than myself having, like, a full plate of food along with my kids, I’m making sure that they have a full plate of food,” Norris said. “I may have either less, or I may not eat.”\n \n\n   \n  Tears come to her face as she worries she’s failing her children. “It feels like I’m failing them because I am trying, I’m trying to do all that I can, and, of course, as a human you get frustrated,” she said, “and I never want my kids to see that, or feel like I’m taking that out on them, for something as simple as dinner.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, to pay for food. They are caught in the middle of a protracted budget  standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have, for more than a month,  been unable to come up with an agreement that would fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  The difficult circumstances SNAP recipients are facing have become one of the most pressing issues for lawmakers, who are under pressure to work harder toward an agreement to get the benefits fully funded again.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the state that was the first testing ground in 1961 for what is now SNAP, some 15% of its 1.7 million   residents rely on the benefits today.\n \n\n   \n  Food banks in the state are struggling to meet demand. They were already dealing with budget cuts caused by federal belt tightening    toward the beginning of the year. Now, things are even more stretched as furloughed federal workers become new clients.\n \n\n   \n  One charity in Martinsburg, CCAP/Loaves & Fishes, saw the number of households it serves roughly double from 72 households per week to 159 in the third week of October, and 119 in the fourth.\n \n\n   \n  Even though it is better positioned than other pantries thanks to the generosity of the community and local churches, there are worries about how long it can continue to keep serving at such a rate.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the SNAP benefits are replenished, the federal workers go back to work, we’re going to be just slammed like this all day,” its president, Leigh Fleming, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s a struggle out here’\n \n\n   \n  Following a court order, the Trump administration earlier this week said it would  partially fund SNAP for November.  But the funds won’t cover full benefits, and November payments for millions of Americans who rely on them have been delayed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then appeared to threaten to withhold SNAP funding on Tuesday until Democrats voted to reopen the government. The White House later clarified the administration would follow through on its plan to fund partial food aid during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the federal government’s responses have brought confusion and dismay.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel as though the folks at Washington quite understand the gravity of the situation,” said Norris. “I just don’t understand how we’ve come to a point where we’re using food in politics and being essentially political pawns.”\n \n\n   \n  Laura Bowles, a West Virginia mother of five children aged four to 13 — with a sixth on the way — said she had to explain to her older kids that “there are some right now in the government who can’t figure things out, and we can’t have everything we used to have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  For her family, it means having to buy less food. “My kids eat a lot,” she said. “And groceries are already so expensive these days — it was already hard,” Bowles said. Like Norris, she is cutting back her own food intake to make her kids’ meals stretch further.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband’s paycheck from Walmart, where he works full time and makes $14 an hour, usually covers all their household bills.\n \n\n   \n  But this month, without SNAP, it’s mostly going to groceries. That means the family has had to pick what other bills to pay.\n \n\n   \n  “I let my trash and internet bill slide already,” said Bowles. Only half the electricity and car insurance could be covered, she added, and the family are even cutting back on driving to the park to save money on gas.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan – but it was God’s plan,” she said. “I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/soccer-cristiano-ronaldo-2026-world-cup","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:03:00-05:00","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo Confirms 2026 World Cup Will Be His Last","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cristiano Ronaldo, the all-time top goalscorer in international soccer with 143 goals and the first male player to score at five World Cups, has announced that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be his final international appearance, stating he will be 41 years old at that time and that he has given everything to the sport.

\n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:49 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for  $1 billion  over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory”  edits  to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  The threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    What is the scandal about?\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK –  the Guardian praised  it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter  to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    How did the scandal originate?\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial slant, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns   about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his  Substack . “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n \n\n   \n  Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor,  reported  Sunday   that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n \n\n   \n    Have heads rolled?\n \n\n   \n  Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n \n\n   \n  Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    What is the BBC? Who owns it?\n \n\n   \n  The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter”, which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n \n\n   \n  It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n \n\n   \n  Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n \n\n   \n  More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n \n\n   \n    Is the BBC impartial?\n \n\n   \n  Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences.\n \n\n   \n  But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump threatened?\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n \n\n   \n  The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n \n\n   \n    Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n \n\n   \n  It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n \n\n   \n  Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the case being brought in Florida?\n \n\n   \n  In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n \n\n   \n  “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n \n\n   \n    Has Trump threatened media outlets before?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay  $15 million  in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay  $16 million  to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n \n\n   \n  Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/anthony-lennon-oklahoma-sex-offender-arrest","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00.000-05:00","title":"After 13 Years, Oklahoma Sex Offender Anthony Lennon Arrested Under Alias Justin Phillips","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In March 2012, a crime scene at a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma, led to the discovery of Anthony Lennon, a man previously charged with possessing child sexual abuse material.

Or, as law enforcement would come to suspect, did he stage his own kidnapping and vanish into the night?\n \n\n   \n  Uncovering the truth would lead Moore police detectives and the US Marshals Service on a manhunt that would span 13 years.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a cat and mouse game,” Moore Police Chief Todd Gibson told CNN. “When you commit crimes – when you victimize children – the full resources of (the law enforcement) community are going to come after you, and it’s never going to stop.”\n \n\n   \n    A crime scene ‘made for TV’\n \n\n   \n  Moore Police Detective Jason Landrum still remembers getting the 4 a.m. call to respond to the Super 8.\n \n\n   \n  When he arrived, he said officers were treating the crime as a robbery with a possible kidnapping. But as he walked through the scene, Landrum said something felt off.\n \n\n   \n  The placement of the evidence was suspicious, he said: The name tag was face up, so Lennon’s name was visible; the shoe print; the blood it tracked.\n \n\n   \n  Even the blood splatter itself stood out to the seasoned detectives investigating the scene.\n \n\n   \n  We “worked numerous crime scenes – and have since then – and it’s definitely not normal the way the blood was on the ground,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But subsequent testing, he added, confirmed the blood was indeed Lennon’s.\n \n\n   \n  The TV was still on in the motel’s office, Landrum said, and what appeared to be Lennon’s dinner – a sandwich and some potato chips – was sitting on the table. The register was also left open, he added, and papers had been scattered.\n \n\n   \n  All the signs pointed to a violent robbery and a possible abduction. But Landrum said the timing felt questionable.\n \n\n   \n  This was not the first time Lennon had been charged with possessing child pornography, more commonly described by law enforcement as child sexual abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  In 2010, Lennon pled guilty to five counts of aggravated possession of child sexual abuse material. He was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison, but a judge suspended that sentence and ordered the then 29-year-old to register as a sex offender as one of the conditions of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  By 2012, Oklahoma prosecutors felt they had amassed enough evidence that Lennon had violated his probation that they – once again – charged him with felony possession of child sex abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  But, according to officials, Lennon disappeared on the same day a $100,000 felony warrant for his arrest became active.\n \n\n   \n  “That was pretty coincidental to us,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  Coincidence or not, Lennon had indeed vanished – and he would remain missing for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It reads and sounds like a made-for-TV movie,” Gibson said. And it was only just beginning.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I hope he’s captured before I leave’\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of responding to the crime scene, Landrum said he called the US Marshals Service to request assistance on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I was afraid that he was going to try and flee the country,” Landrum said. “So, I contacted them to help me get word out to the borders.”\n \n\n   \n  But the days after Lennon’s disappearance dragged into months, and eventually, years.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have been really easy for us to just put this in the deactivated file … ” Gibson said. “But there was never a time that we stopped looking.”\n \n\n   \n  To balance their regular caseload, Landrum said Moore police detectives passed the baton to the US Marshals, who specialized in tracking criminals across state lines and solving cold cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Johnny Kuhlman, US Marshal for the Western District of Oklahoma, instructed his team to reopen the case and begin tracking new leads.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, he told CNN, marshals have filed numerous search warrants, conducted multiple interviews and logged hundreds of miles on road trips as they investigated Lennon’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been to several different states looking (for Lennon), following up on leads that turned out not to be true,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office added Lennon’s name to the state’s  10 Most Wanted list .\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he’s been haunted by the thought that Lennon could escape justice for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m getting closer to the end of my career, and this was one that stayed with me,” he said. “I always said that I hope he’s captured before I leave.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, two weeks ago, Landrum got the call he’d been waiting for.\n \n\n   \n    After more than a decade, officers finally make an arrest\n \n\n   \n  US Marshals had been following leads on a man named “Justin Phillips” who was living in Canton, New York – roughly 20 miles from the Canadian border.\n \n\n   \n  After months of investigating, marshals now believed “Phillips” was, in fact, Lennon, who’d been living in the state under an alias.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Moore police and the Marshals Service declined to share additional information about how they located Lennon, saying it could lead to additional charges.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of receiving the call from the US Marshals, Landrum said he’d booked a flight to join investigators working the case about an hour outside of Canton.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a small town,” Landrum said. “We knew our presence would be known fairly quickly with a large amount of us in that area, so we didn’t want to be anywhere close to him because we didn’t want to tip him off.”\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he joined surveillance teams that trailed Lennon as he left his home in Canton and spent the day at the local college where he was enrolled under the alias.\n \n\n   \n  SUNY-Canton confirmed to CNN Monday that an individual using the name Justin Phillips was a student at the school studying in the Engineering Science program.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators followed him to his neighborhood grocery store – and swooped in to make their arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “We still hadn’t 100% confirmed it was Anthony, even though I knew it was because I’ve been staring at his pictures for 13 years,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But he waited to call Gibson and inform the rest of the Moore Police Department until a fingerprint analysis conclusively revealed what he knew to be true:\n \n\n   \n  After 13 years on the run, law enforcement had finally arrested Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as he was driving back to his hotel room, Landrum said he called former detectives who’d worked on the Lennon case and had since retired to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “They haven’t forgot about this case,” he said. “And they were very, very excited.”\n \n\n   \n    He preyed on the ‘wrong community’\n \n\n   \n  But even with the fingerprint evidence, Landrum said, Lennon has continued to stand by the alias “Justin Phillips.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Lennon’s attorney, who confirmed she represents “a man alleged to be Anthony Lennon,” but stressed he is entitled to a presumption of innocence.\n \n\n   \n  She did not offer additional comment on the alleged probation violation and possession of child sexual abuse material charges that her client faces.\n \n\n   \n  Lennon holds a master’s degree in computer science, according to  the US Marshals , and was working toward a doctorate at the time of his disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said he believes Lennon was able to remain hidden for so long, in part, because of his extensive knowledge of computers.\n \n\n   \n  But he credited the tenacity and dedication of dozens of officers, detectives and US Marshals for the apprehension of the man who he said has eluded justice for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Lennon has been living in multiple parts of the country on the run from the law for over a decade,” Gibson said. “He is a person that decided to prey on children in the wrong community.”\n \n\n   \n  “You may think, for a while, that you’ve gotten away with it, and you may get relaxed, and as soon as you let your guard down, you’ll have strong men (and) strong women, knocking down your door to bring you to custody and bring you to justice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

\n        10:59 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  Martin confirmed Monday on Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast that the Justice Department wants to see Peters moved to a federal prison.\n \n\n   \n  “(Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche is the guy leading on this. We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said of the Trump administration’s contacts with Colorado officials. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say we want something, you change your tune.”\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Polis and Weiser, who is defending Peters’ convictions in state and federal courts, are “fully synced up” on how to resist Trump’s pressure campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doing her time,” the person said. “We don’t let threats affect us. We have a job to do and we’re going to do it. We are going to uphold the law.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, Polis’ office referred inquiries to the Colorado Department of Corrections. A department spokeswoman, Alondra Gonzalez, said there is currently no formal process underway to move Peters out of state custody and a transfer would require the approval of state prison officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Transferring an individual is an action typically initiated by the Colorado Department of Corrections, not an outside entity, and is based on our internal classification and threat-assessment protocol,” Gonzalez said in an email. “This process is most frequently reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs. The Department has not initiated this process for Tina Peters.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no basis for the (federal) Bureau of Prisons to request a transfer of her custody.

object?\n \n\n   \n  Both are equally powerful, deemed indestructible and when they do meet, the laws of physics are pushed to their limits.\n \n\n   \n  For two years now, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have been those dominant entities in tennis, redefining the boundaries of the game, carving up the Grand Slams between them and rewriting the record books.\n \n\n   \n  It’s apt then that in a year of fine margins, thrilling encounters and breathtaking athleticism, the gripping “Sincaraz” narrative boils down to one final chapter.\n \n\n   \n  The setting? Turin. The tournament? Nitto ATP Finals. The prize? To be crowned the year-end world number one.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n \n\n   \n    Dominant duo\n \n\n   \n  Just as in 2024, the seemingly inseparable duo have swept all four Grand Slam titles in 2025 with each encounter proving more tantalising than the last.\n \n\n   \n  After Sinner defended his Australian Open title in January – his final tournament before serving a suspension for failing two doping tests – what followed was a trilogy of finals of epic proportions.\n \n\n   \n  A French Open for the ages saw Alcaraz prevail, a month later the Italian showed remarkable resilience to bounce back and claim his maiden Wimbledon crown before the Spaniard produced a stunning display to secure a second US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Ten majors so far between them – six to Alcaraz; four to Sinner – leaving the rest of the tour reeling by a considerable margin.\n \n\n   \n  Still only 22 and 24, respectively, and scarily with still room to improve, the rivalry is set to endure.\n \n\n   \n  But is that how they see it?\n \n\n   \n  “I think the word rivalry takes on the professional part, in the tennis side,” Alcaraz told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to find the weaknesses from each other on court but then when we shake hands and we are off the court, we’re totally different.\n \n\n   \n  “We sometimes forgot about the rivalry we were getting on tour and we became persons and that’s what it means, the word rivalry.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m seeing him more than my mom’\n \n\n   \n  That mutual humility, respect and admiration on and off the court has been ever present since their first meeting as teenagers in Alcaraz’s professional debut in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  While their on-court showdowns – characterized by breathtaking rallies and heavy hitting – have left audiences on the edge of their seats, off-court their ever-growing friendship has equally captivated fans around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The duo took to the court for a practice session last week ahead of the main draw, which drew thousands of viewers to the tournament’s live stream.\n \n\n   \n  A post-practice selfie shortly followed, racking up plenty of social media attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When you practice together, see each other in the locker then it’s natural that you get to know each other better and better,” Sinner said of their burgeoning friendship.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about family and life in general, sharing also some personal stuff.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s changed. It just has become better because we know each other better.”\n \n\n   \n  “I said in the summer, I’m seeing him more than, than my mom actually. … I never get tired of seeing him,” Alcaraz jokes.\n \n\n   \n    Race to the top\n \n\n   \n  For this week, at least, that friendship will have to take a back seat as the two vie for the both the season-ending title and honor of finishing 2025 as the tour’s top-ranked player.\n \n\n   \n  Sinner may have taken the bragging rights last year – claiming both in a sensational 2024 – but this time around it’s advantage Alcaraz.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard – who ended the year top of the tree in 2022 – currently holds a slender lead over his rival in the rankings.\n \n\n   \n  He knows that reaching the final with at least one round-robin win or sweeping his round-robin matches will guarantee that award for a second time.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard is firmly on course for that quest, having defeated Australia’s Alex de Minaur on Sunday in his opening match of the tournament.\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Turin would bring with it differing sets of emotions for the two.\n \n\n   \n  For Alcaraz, a first Nitto ATP Finals trophy would cap off what he deems to be his best year to date, having won eight titles this season alone.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard began that quest on Sunday with victory over Australia’s Alex de Minaur in their round-robin clash.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t hide the results. It’s my best year so far without a doubt in terms of level, in terms of consistency” he acknowledges.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw myself grow up a lot since the last year to understand some situations, to realize what I have to do to get to know myself even more and what I need off the court.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is a general situation on and off the court which made this year my best.”\n \n\n   \n    Separated by a hair’s breadth\n \n\n   \n  Sinner meanwhile goes into Turin on a scintillating indoor winning streak having recently brushed aside Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime to win his maiden Paris Masters title.\n \n\n   \n  Whilst his powerful, pinpoint ball placement and supremacy on indoor courts makes him a strong favourite to reclaim his respective crowns, the Italian is aware of the threat posed by his nearest challenger and the expectation to deliver again in front of his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “There is for sure this extra motivation and some pressure so it’s a privilege to be in this position,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something great to finish the year with a win and with an incredible big trophy but you also don’t have to forget how the season went and everything we both have done for the two years, and it has been again a great year.”\n \n\n   \n  So where, if anywhere, will an advantage be gained?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, the secret weapon, could be Alcaraz’s latest bold statement: A dashing black and white haircut.\n \n\n   \n  Looking the part of a comic book hero capable of backing it up with his superhuman skills, the Spaniard hair is in its third incarnation since his initial buzzcut caused a stir at the US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, it’s evolved into platinum blonde and now colors – as Sinner remarked – aptly resembling Turin’s powerhouse football team, Juventus.\n \n\n   \n  “My team are scared about it next year,” the Spaniard says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “This year has been really good with the changes.\n \n\n   \n  “If something works, why should I change it?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/sally-kirkland-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-05:00","title":"Sally Kirkland, stage and screen star who earned an Oscar nomination in ‘Anna,’ dead at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sally Kirkland, an acclaimed stage and screen actress known for her Oscar-nominated role in 'Anna' and her collaborations with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in 'The Sting,' has died at 84.

She was 84.\n \n\n   \n  Her representative, Michael Greene, said Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.\n \n\n   \n  Friends established a GoFundMe account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland acted in such films as “The Way We Were” with Barbra Streisand, “Revenge” with Kevin Costner, “Cold Feet” with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard’s “EDtv,” Oliver Stone’s “JFK,” “Heatwave” with Cicely Tyson, “High Stakes” with Kathy Bates, “Bruce Almighty” with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie “The Haunted,” about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks’ “Blazing Saddles.”\n \n\n   \n  Her biggest role was in 1987’s “Anna” as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring to a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova.

main political rival, has previously denied all the accusations against him, saying they are politically motivated, and his party on Tuesday rejected the latest charges as “nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate move that also deepened an unprecedented year-long legal crackdown on Erdogan’s critics, the Istanbul prosecutor asked a higher court to consider shutting down Imamoglu’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP).\n \n\n   \n  Istanbul Chief Prosecutor Akin Gurlek announced the indictment at a press conference, saying it names 402 suspects, including the mayor, and accuses them of forming a criminal organization, bribery, fraud and bid-rigging.\n \n\n   \n  Gurlek said the network caused 160 billion lira ($3.8 billion) in losses to the Turkish state over a 10-year period.\n

Why do we keep making boxing biopics? \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:30 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sydney Sweeney’s latest movie was down for the count in its opening weekend at the box office.\n \n\n   \n  According to the receipts from  Box Office Mojo , “Christy,” a boxer biopic, was released in more than 2,000 theaters but took in just $1.3 million on opening weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Boxing movies about real people have a tough time connecting with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Christy’ gave even one woman the courage to take her first step toward safety, then we will have succeeded,” Sweeney wrote on Instagram on Monday. “So yes I’m proud. Why? Because we don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact.”\n \n\n   \n  The film tells the story of Christy Martin, a pioneering American boxer, who survived a murder attempt by her trainer-spouse. (Martin is  now married  to a  former competitor , Lisa Holewyne.)\n \n\n   \n  Sweeney is an A-list star but this year she’s been featured in more  controversy-centered headlines  about her advertising work than she has been in  successful  film and TV projects. That attention she’s gotten has not immediately resulted in people in seats this year.\n \n\n   \n  What happened here? The truth about boxing films in general and boxing films starring women may have some answers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year’s “The Fire Inside” starred Ryan Destiny. She played female boxer Claressa “T-Rex” Shields, who competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and has held multiple championships across various weight classes.\n \n\n   \n  It got positive reviews, but only earned $1.96 million in its opening weekend, picking up to $8 million during its entire domestic run, according to Box Office Mojo.\n \n\n   \n  “Against the Ropes,” a 2004 fictionalized version of the life of boxing manager Jackie Kallen, starring Meg Ryan, garnered negative reviews and slim big box office receipts to match.\n \n\n   \n  That played a role in Ryan stepping out of the field for a bit. During  a 2019 interview with the New York Times  Ryan was asked if “Against the Ropes” and another film, “In the Cut,” “had been better received by critics or audiences” would she have still have taken a break from her Hollywood career, as she did.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual,” Ryan said at the time. “I felt done when they felt done, probably.”\n \n\n   \n  What about boxing movies about men? “Hands of Stone,” the Robert De Niro film about Roberto Durán, opened widely in 2016 and  seems to  have tracked very similarly to “Christy,” with a weak opening weekend and a slow follow.\n \n\n   \n  The Miles Teller biopic of Vinny Pazienza, “Bleed for This,”  similarly  failed to fill theaters. “Phantom Punch,” the 2009 Sonny Liston biopic starring Ving Rhames, performed so poorly it has been almost erased from  the permanent record. \n \n\n   \n  It might feel like audiences,  despite their love  of “Raging Bull” and the “Rocky” franchise, just don’t love biographical boxing movies about real people that much.\n \n\n   \n  Except, every once in a while, one film proves an exception to the rule. “The Fighter,” David O. Russell’s fictionalized biography of boxer Micky Ward, was a rare worldwide smash in 2010. Ron Howard’s 2005 “Cinderella Man,” about James J. Braddock and starring Russell Crowe, was also a rare critical and commercial success.\n \n\n   \n  The best-known women’s boxing films aren’t biopics.\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Rodriguez made her movie acting debut in “Girlfight,” a fictional independent film. She played a hot-tempered teen who decides to channel her anger into boxing. The very inexpensive film didn’t pull in a ton of money, but it did launch Rodriguez’s movie career, which has included the billion-dollar “Fast & Furious” franchise. It also made a name for Karyn Kusama, who later directed “Jennifer’s Body” and is an executive producer of “Yellowjackets.”\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s the biggest of them all: the fictional 2004 film “Million Dollar Baby.” Not only did it find commercial success, it met wide critical acclaim. It won best picture at the Academy Awards and stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won best actress and best supporting actor, respectively. Clint Eastwood, who pushed for the film to be made and costarred as well, also won a best director Oscar.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/world/mali-tiktoker-killed-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:39:00-05:00","title":"Malian TikToker killed by suspected jihadists after pro-army posts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"TikTok influencer Mariame Cissé, who posted pro-army videos, was abducted and executed by suspected jihadists in Tonka, Mali, after receiving death threats.

win just landed Republicans with a huge political headache \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s the Trump ship that never sails.\n \n\n   \n  The president was back at it on Monday, promising an imminent solution to America’s growing health care crisis — on which he has repeatedly failed to deliver in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time, where the people get the money,” President Donald Trump said, referring specifically to Americans thrown into crisis by  expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies . “We’re talking about trillions and trillions of dollars, where the people get the money,” he added, without giving details about a vague idea to  send cash to affected policyholders  to replace subsidies while bypassing insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s off-the-cuff answer was a typical example of the waffle he sometimes conjures to escape a jam in a photo-op. But he could not disguise the downside of his “win” in the government shutdown, which looks set to end after Democrats failed to secure their top demand: the extension of  those enhanced Obamacare subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Republicans once again own the issue of health care, with millions of citizens —  not just those on ACA plans  — afflicted by rising premiums and high deductibles against the backdrop of a  wider cost-of-living crisis . And just as in his first term, Trump lacks a comprehensive, detailed plan to bring relief to citizens who lack health care, who can’t afford the plans they have or who know that the loss of a job could leave them without any coverage at all.\n \n\n   \n  If the GOP cannot fix the immediate issue of the subsidies — and convince voters they have a serious solution to this and other affordability questions — their  2026 midterm election hopes  could take a dive.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s fogginess on health care is nothing new. Repeated unfulfilled promises to act took their place alongside his much-lampooned “ infrastructure weeks ” as punch lines in his first term. Trump’s pledges to replace Obamacare shimmered with hyperbole but delivered nothing, and the 2010 law survives despite multiple Republican efforts to destroy it.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific.” At rallies, he promised Americans new health care that would cost less but be far better. If that sounds impossible, it’s probably because it is.\n \n\n   \n  Early in his first term, Trump promised that change was on the way. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”  he wrote  on the website formerly known as Twitter in March 2017. The GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, partly because it couldn’t come up with an alternative, didn’t stop Trump’s sunny predictions. “The Republican Party will be soon be known as theparty of health care,”  the president declared  in March 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Second term, same as the first. In his debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Trump was mocked for  saying he had  “concepts of a plan” to make health care “better and less expensive.” More than a year later — and despite some significant efforts by Trump to bring down the cost of some prescription drugs — Americans are still waiting for his wider solutions.\n \n\n   \n    Republican divisions boil over health care\n \n\n   \n  The fight over health care was not just at the center of the government shutdown battle with Democrats. It’s tearing at Republican Party unity. It’s even estranged Trump and one of his most outspoken supporters,  Marjorie Taylor Greene . The Georgia representative broke ranks early in the shutdown to highlight  ACA insurance premiums  for her family that she said would double in price due to expiring subsidies. While no fan of the ACA, she lashed out at her own party. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene wrote on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s persistent criticism is a warning sign for House Speaker Mike Johnson after he called back the House to vote on the Senate plan to reopen the government this week. It might explain why he was so keen to keep the chamber dark during a shutdown that set internal GOP dissent simmering. Greene further distanced herself from Trump on Monday, saying on X that he should spend less time meeting foreign leaders and instead hold “nonstop” meetings on domestic policy.\n \n\n   \n  The president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.” Greene then told CNN, “I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!”\n \n\n   \n  Greene might now be regarded as a MAGA heretic by some in Trump’s orbit. But her comments on health care raise another possibility — that she’s far more in tune with the economic insecurity felt by regular Americans than a billionaire president and his wealthy Cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not alone. During the shutdown, a group of endangered House Republicans  wrote to Johnson  to urge him to address expiring enhanced ACA subsidies when the government reopens. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies as part of the deal with moderate Democrats to reopen the government. Chances of a Democrat-written bill passing are slim. But the vote will put GOP senators on the record and on a political spot.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson hasn’t pledged to hold a similar vote — one reason why progressive Democrats are angry about centrist Senate Democrats’ compromise to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Monday that he’d always been willing to talk about rising health care costs, but that Democrats had squandered weeks of valuable time by triggering the shutdown last month. He promised debate on a plan to get to the “root cause” of the health care issue. But that is unlikely to help ACA policyholders forced to decide now whether to give up health plans they can’t afford or pay punitively rising premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson could not tell Tapper whether there’d be a vote on this issue soon. “I’m not committing to it or not committing to it. What I’m saying is that we do a deliberative process. It’s the way this always works and we have to have time to do that,” the speaker said. But the tiny GOP majority gives little cause for optimism that an issue as complex and divisive as health care reform is something the fractious GOP and an absent president could handle.\n \n\n   \n  One tangible gain for Democrats in the shutdown drama was their highlighting of the ACA issue and attacks on Republicans for failing to fix health care. In  an NBC News poll  taken last month during the shutdown, 10% of respondents cited the cost of health care premiums as the single top issue deciding their vote for Congress next year. And 49% of respondents said Democrats would do a better job dealing with health care compared with 26% who thought the same of Republicans\n \n\n   \n   Many Democrats are furious  that their moderate Senate colleagues made a deal with Republicans to reopen the government because they see it as a betrayal of Americans on the health care issue. But Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who helped broker the deal and joined seven others in the Democratic caucus to back it, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan the deal would show whether Republicans were serious.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, because of the shutdown fight, we’ve had a number of Republicans who have figured out that this is an issue for them,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. “So, now we’ll see. We’ll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n  Viewing Democratic tactics, a cynic might wonder whether the party, which failed to make the enhanced Obamacare credits permanent during the Biden administration, laid a trap for Republicans on an issue their rivals always failed to solve, especially under Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But some Republicans don’t buy the idea that the party is vulnerable on health care, arguing that Democrats would be blamed for higher costs. GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt told CNN that “I think people know that Democrats own Obamacare, and it’s been a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n    How Trump has tried to lower some health care costs\n \n\n   \n  Republicans argue that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” domestic policy law had already made significant steps to make health care more affordable by loosening the power of insurance companies and by restoring choice and control, partly by  handing more responsibility to the states . But multiple health care analysts and groups say that the bill’s  cuts to Medicaid funding  could leave millions vulnerable to losing coverage and threaten many rural hospitals with closure.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has several initiatives designed to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. It plans to launch  TrumpRx , a direct-to-consumer website, early next year. Last week, the president unveiled a plan to make  certain obesity drugs  available for as little as $149 in an arrangement that gives pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk tariff breaks. If this plan works, it could be lifesaving for many patients who can’t get the drugs through their insurers and can’t afford out-of-pocket prices to buy them.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative reflects Trump’s willingness to use government power to intervene in markets, which has also been seen in other sectors, and which flies in the face of conservative orthodoxy. A plan he recently floated to send money directly to ACA policyholders, instead of offering subsidies, also seems to spring from a similar motivation to shake up the industry.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the idea is fraught with uncertainties, including whether such payments would cover the shortfall of all the subsidies. Another question is whether it would simply make up the shortfall in subsidies to pay for premiums. Or would it be a separate payment that patients could use to pay for the costs of treatment directly?\n \n\n   \n  In the latter case of a payment that bypasses insurance firms, recipients might be exposed to massive costs if they get an adverse diagnosis. Trump told Fox News on Monday evening that he didn’t want money to go to insurance companies but that it would go into a separate account so people could negotiate their own, better health insurance.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to feel like entrepreneurs,” Trump said. But he gave no details of how such a complex scheme could help policyholders now, and did not explain how it would lower costs.\n \n\n   \n  And spiking health costs don’t only afflict ACA policyholders. If the government sent cash to certain Americans, how would that be fair to other taxpayers? And wouldn’t state-financed payments for health care go against everything the GOP believes?\n \n\n   \n  Such thorny questions, and the president’s past failures to deliver on health care, explain the Republican Party’s new but familiar political nightmare on an issue that causes anxiety for tens of millions of voters.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/fifty-year-mortgage","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump just floated a 50-year mortgage.

floated a 50-year mortgage. Is that a good idea? \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Most first-time homebuyers in the United States take out 30-year mortgages. Under a new proposal from the Trump administration, they may soon have an even longer loan option.\n \n\n   \n  This week, President Donald Trump introduced a new idea to tackle home affordability: a 50-year mortgage loan. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s   proposal is light on details, administration officials say a 50-year mortgage would lower monthly payments, helping more Americans currently priced out of the market.\n \n\n   \n  But many housing experts warn the plan could backfire, raising the cost of homeownership by stretching out payments, adding more interest over time and driving up home prices.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not a good idea,” said Richard Green, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. “The monthly payment savings would be really small. At the same time, you’re putting people at risk, because it takes a really long time for them to start paying down their loan.”\n \n\n   \n    Total interest payments could skyrocket\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year mortgage loan traces its roots back to the Great Depression. Over the last century, it has become the dominant way to purchase a house in the United States. Many Americans prefer   a longer loan period because payments are lower than those of, say, a 15-year mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  A 50-year mortgage could have even lower payments.\n \n\n   \n  “What it does is, it reduces the monthly payment quite a bit for a typical home for middle America by a few hundred dollars a month,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said in a Monday interview on Fox. “We need to help people get back into homes.”\n \n\n   \n  But homeowners would end up paying far more in interest over time, Green said.\n \n\n   \n  Take a $450,000 home, for example. With a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 6.25% interest rate, the monthly payment would be about $2,771. Over the life of that loan, the homeowner would pay more than $547,000 in interest.\n \n\n   \n  With a 50-year loan at the same rate, the monthly payment would fall to around $2,452 – but total interest would balloon to about $1.02 million, or 87% more than on the 30-year loan.\n \n\n   \n  “With a 50-year loan, you’re paying a teeny, tiny amount to your principal loan early on, so your interest payments are not going down very much,” Green said. “It depends on what the interest rate is, but it could be like 30 or 40 years before you’ve even paid half your mortgage (principal) under those circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  The best way to improve housing affordability is  to build more homes  where people want to live, Green said. A cheaper home loan might boost demand, but without adding new supply, it could actually push prices higher.\n \n\n   \n    Mortgage rates may differ for 50-year loans\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether a 50-year mortgage would carry the same interest rates as a 30-year loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Until you figure out who the buyer is for that mortgage and how they’re going to model out the borrower behavior, it’s really tough to say anything more than the rate will probably be a little bit higher than the 30-year,” said Jeff DerGurahian, chief investment officer at loanDepot, a mortgage lender.\n \n\n   \n  A 50-year loan carries a higher risk of default because it stretches so long. Lenders may charge higher interest rates as a result. And since it would take borrowers much longer to build equity, a drop in housing prices could leave more homeowners owing more than their properties are worth.   \n \n\n   \n  There’s also a legal question surrounding 50-year mortgages. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, passed after the 2008 housing crisis, loan terms cannot exceed 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  “You would need a lot of legislation to bring this about,” Green said of the 50-year mortgage proposal.\n \n\n   \n  When asked, the White House did not provide details about any legislative plans.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a White House official said: “President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans. Any official policy changes will be announced by the White House.”\n \n\n   \n    A foot in the door to homeownership?\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the average age of first-time homebuyers in America climbed to a record high of 40 years old, according to  data  released last week by the National Association of Realtors. A combination of sky-high home prices and mortgage rates stuck between 6% and 7% have locked many young Americans out of homeownership.\n \n\n   \n  With a 50-year loan, some of those first-time buyers could be paying off their home loans well into their 90s.\n \n\n   \n  But Phil Crescenzo, a vice president at Nation One Mortgage Corporation, said the industry has been overly negative on the 50-year mortgage proposal.\n \n\n   \n  While homeowners would build equity more slowly than with a shorter loan, Crescenzo noted that, in some cases, a 50-year mortgage could still be better than renting and never accumulating any home equity at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like somebody would have to stay in that loan forever. It’s a starting point,” Crescenzo said, pointing out that homeowners always have the option to refinance their loans.\n \n\n   \n  “If I had the option where I’m renting the home or I can get a 50-year mortgage and I’m not going to gain much equity for a couple of years, I would still take that deal versus renting,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/redistricting-utah-judge-democrat-leaning-district-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:40:00-05:00","title":"Judge adopts Utah congressional map that creates a Democrat-leaning district for 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. District Judge in Utah, Dianna Gibson, rejected a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting map that was found to unduly favor Republicans and violate voter-established anti-gerrymandering standards.

It keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was the case previously.\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s ruling throws a curveball for Republicans in a state where they expected a clean sweep as they’re working to add winnable seats elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Nationally, Democrats need to net three US House seats next year to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which is trying to buck a historic pattern of the president’s party losing seats in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  The newly approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that has not had a Democrat in Congress since early 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a win for every Utahn,” said state House and Senate Democrats in a joint statement. “We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling thrust Utah into a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump urged other Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic states are considering new maps of their own, with California voters approving a map last week that gives Democrats a shot at winning five more seats. Republicans are still ahead in the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting typically occurs once a decade after a census. There are no federal restrictions to redrawing districts mid-decade, but some states — more led by Democrats than Republicans — set their own limitations.\n \n\n   \n  The Utah ruling gives an unexpected boost to Democrats, who have fewer opportunities to gain seats through redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  If Gibson had instead approved the map drawn by lawmakers, all four districts would still lean Republican but two would have become slightly competitive for Democrats. Their proposal gambled on Republicans’ ability to protect all four seats under much slimmer margins rather than create a single-left leaning district.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling came minutes before midnight on the day the state’s top election official said was the latest possible date to enact a new congressional map so county clerks would have enough time to prepare for candidate filings for the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have argued Gibson does not have legal authority to enact a map that wasn’t approved by the Legislature. State Rep. Matt MacPherson called the ruling a “gross abuse of power” and said he has opened a bill to pursue impeachment against Gibson.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said in her ruling she has an obligation to ensure a lawful map is in place by the deadline.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/food/chipotle-sweetgreen-cava-earnings-problems-slop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Cash-Strapped American Workers Fall Out of Love With Slop Bowls","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent downturn in consumer spending has significantly impacted fast-casual restaurant chains such as Cava, Chipotle, and Sweetgreen, which rely heavily on younger consumers aged 25 to 35.

The stock, which surged 162% in 2024, has fallen nearly 60% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We know our Gen Z consumers are certainly facing headwinds this year that may not have existed last year,” Cava CEO Brett Schulman told CNN, citing   the resumption of student loan repayments, record-low  consumer sentiment  levels and Gen Z unemployment that’s  “double the national rate.” \n \n\n   \n  Last week, Cava ( CAVA ) revealed that its traffic was flat for the second consecutive quarter, so it cut its same-store sales outlook to 3% - 4% (from 4% - 6%) for the rest of 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “When you look at the (fast-casual) industry since 2019, while sales have grown, transactions are actually down 7%,” he said. “The industry has gotten too expensive for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, some of those once reliable customers are now buying more groceries to save money, said R.J. Hottovy, a restaurant analyst at data analytics firm Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n  “These consumers are simultaneously shifting visits to grocery chains like Trader Joe’s and other alternative food retailers as they seek more affordable options,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That was pointed out    during Chipotle’s earnings report,   which  showed miserable results  at the end of October. The chain cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter, and shares are down 50% this year.\n \n\n   \n  CEO Scott Boatwright said  younger consumers , particularly those aged 25 to 35   who make up a quarter of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home,” he told analysts during Chipotle’s latest earnings call. “It is one of our core consumer cohorts. They feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  He argues that Chipotle ( CMG ) is still more affordable than its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The fast-casual sector is just out of favor and has been deemed unaffordable and we are lumped into that,” he said, bristling at criticism that Chipotle has  become  too expensive . “But I will still tell you, we are still at 20% to 30% discount to our fast-casual peers in the sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaccaro agrees that Chipotle’s value proposition “remains very strong with an entry-level price point of less than $10 in most markets (excluding higher-cost markets   like New York).” But he thinks some consumers might have forgotten, since the chain typically avoids advertising around its prices.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Chipotle is faring better than Sweetgreen, the once high-flying salad and warm bowl chain whose stock finished nearly 200% higher in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Shares have, however, nosedived 83% this year, and the company’s market cap is hovering at $680 million — a steep fall from its nearly $5 billion valuation when it went  public in 2021 .\n \n\n   \n  Sweetgreen ( SG ) revealed in its earnings   last   Thursday that same-store sales slid 9.5% and visits fell nearly 12%. That caps off a tough year for the brand, which ended a  salad subscription program  and axed selling fries after just five months.\n \n\n   \n  “The 25 to 35 (year old) consumer is the most under pressure, and they make up about 30% of our consumer base,” said Sweetgreen CFO Jamie McConnell on a call with analysts, adding that their spending declined about 15%.\n \n\n   \n  To lure back value-conscious customers, Sweetgreen this week will begin promoting that it has boosted protein portions by 25%.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the current problems, analysts say the chains are well positioned for the future. That’s because there will always be consumer appetite for “high quality, fresh ingredients at reasonable price points,” said Vaccaro.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/military-strikes-platforms-caribbean-pacific","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"What the US military is using to strike alleged drug boats","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military has intensified its counter-narcotics campaign in the Pacific and Caribbean by deploying MQ-9 Reaper drones, AC-130J gunships, and F-35 fighter jets to destroy suspected drug boats.

\nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has undertaken a  campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats  in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea using a variety of drones, gunships, and fighter jets, according to people familiar with the assets being deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes have been carried out using MQ-9 Reaper drones, the sources said, which are remotely piloted aircraft used by the military and are typically armed with Hellfire missiles. Other strikes have been conducted by manned aircraft, including AC-130J gunships and fighter jets, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  To date the Pentagon has not publicly acknowledged what aircraft or hardware the military is using to conduct the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Since early September, the US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has concentrated many of its assets in Puerto Rico, including the MQ-9 drones, F-35 fighter jets, and at least one AC-130J gunship. All have limited ranges and are likely being used for the strikes in the Caribbean. The gunship was  spotted  on October 9 armed with precision-guided missiles for striking ground targets, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, an  AC-130J  gunship operated by the US Air Force surfaced in El Salvador, at US Cooperative Security Location (CSL) Comalapa, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The facilities in both Puerto Rico and El Savador are seeing highly unusual US military activity.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004,  is now back up and running , according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base.\n \n\n   \n  And while the US facility at El Salvador International Airport has regularly hosted surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft since it was set up in 2000, the outpost had until recently been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the United States Southern Command.\n \n\n   \n  The position of the facility near El Salvador’s coast makes it uniquely positioned to play a role in the US campaign in the Pacific Ocean. Previously, most potential smuggling vessels transiting the Pacific would have been too far from the types of attack aircraft sources said have been used for the campaign, all of which have limited range and were based either in Puerto Rico or the continental US.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating out of Comalapa provides more options and permits a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean — through which much of the cocaine trafficked toward the United States passes — to be surveilled and defended,” explained Dr. Ryan Berg, the director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Before the US began striking alleged drug boats in September, CSL Comalapa played a different role in fighting narcotics trafficking, historically hosting maritime surveillance aircraft, including a Navy P-8A and P-3 Orion operated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n \n\n   \n  The MQ-9 Reapers, at least seven of which are based in Puerto Rico, according to photos captured in Aguadilla, are predominantly used to strike targets with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, a weapon that was originally designed to destroy enemy tanks but that has become a workhorse for the military as part of drone operations against a range of ground targets.\n \n\n   \n  The AC-130J can carry the Hellfire but it is primarily armed with large guns. The AC-130J seen in photographs obtained by CNN in El Salvador had two cannons—including a 105mm howitzer— visible on the left side of the gunship.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon shifted its strategy in recent weeks to more frequently striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN has reported. The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia to Mexico and eventually to the US, rather than Venezuela, the origin for some of the boats targeted in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have been seeking answers from the Pentagon about how much the counternarcotics campaign is costing taxpayers, but officials briefing Congress in recent weeks have not provided an overall dollar amount, sources said. Instead, administration officials have acknowledged that each strike typically costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, between the cost per flight hour of the platform and the cost of the munition used.\n \n\n   \n  One hellfire missile, for example, typically costs about $150,000, and reaper drones cost around $3,500 per hour to fly. An F-35 costs around $40,000 per hour to fly. The cost per flight hour of an AC-130J gunship is not public but its predecessor, the AC-130U, which was phased out in 2019, cost over $40,000 per hour to fly.\n \n\n   \n  The targeting for the strikes is being done via a joint US Southern Command/Special Operations Command targeting cell, with input from the intelligence community, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But  questions have been raised  about whether everyone the US has killed is truly a member of, or even affiliated with, one of the dozens of drug cartels the US has designated as terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In  several briefings  to Congress, including one last week, administration officials have acknowledged that they do not necessarily know the identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it. Strikes are instead conducted based on intelligence that the vessels are linked to a specific cartel or criminal organization, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, additional military assets are steaming toward the Caribbean, including the Ford Carrier Strike Group. A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally have been located in  US Southern Command  since last month.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have told Congress that the Ford is moving there to support counternarcotic operations and conduct intelligence gathering, two of the sources said, but its deployment to the region is raising questions about whether President Donald Trump could soon launch strikes against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In a briefing last month, two senior US Special Operations officers could not explain why the administration needed so many powerful military assets stationed in the Caribbean just to blow up small boats, a source familiar with the closed-door session on Capitol Hill said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/schumer-senate-shutdown-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Schumer Faces Liberal Fury Over Government Shutdown Vote Amid Democratic Infighting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced significant backlash from progressive Democrats and Senate candidates during a funding standoff in November 2025, after voting against a bipartisan government reopening bill.

reopen the government. He’s facing liberal fury anyway. \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went out of his way to embody the anger of his Democratic base during this fall’s funding showdown with Republicans — an intentional turnaround from his capitulation in March that turned him into a villain in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  He’s still taking the blame from many in his party anyway.\n \n\n   \n  Despite voting against the final deal on Monday night, the New York Democrat is again being pummeled by vocal Democrats across the party, who argue he allowed his centrist members to strike a deal with the GOP that fails to prevent spiking health care costs for tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  In the immediate aftermath of the deal, many of his own Senate Democrats were mum about whether they’d continue to support him as leader. Multiple House Democrats called for him to resign. And a raft of Senate candidates trashed him as they look to survive tight Democratic primaries in key races.\n \n\n   \n  There is no immediate threat to Schumer’s leadership, according to multiple Democratic sources. Not one of the Democrats calling for Schumer to step down as leader is a current member of his caucus. Still, frustrations are mounting privately among Senate Democrats that Schumer and his leadership team lacked a long-term plan to secure real concessions from the GOP in the funding fight— and that the party ultimately ended up without a tangible legislative win, according to a half-dozen Senate Democratic sources. And there is growing chatter about what it means for his future after the 2026 midterms and if he chooses to run again in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “He did the right thing in March,” Sen. John Fetterman told CNN, referring to Schumer’s decision to work with Republicans to avert a painful shutdown earlier this year. “But I think he’s discovering that you can’t get back into the good graces of the Indivisible folks,” he said, referring to the far-left activist group.\n \n\n   \n  Though Fetterman has been a vocal critic of his party’s strategy, the Pennsylvania Democrat said he would not directly criticize Schumer: “I’m not going to put a blade in my leader.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona wouldn’t directly say whether he had confidence in Schumer. Asked by CNN about the Democratic leader’s handling of the shutdown, Kelly pivoted to President Donald Trump, whom he called “an irrational president who doesn’t care about the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed again on whether he had confidence in Schumer, Kelly conceded that it had been a “rough” time for Senate Democrats. “I’ve been here four and a half years now, and [Schumer has] been the leader, and I understand why people look at this and say, well, this was kind of a rough period,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, pressed if he had confidence in Schumer, was also mum on the leader’s future. “I was glad to see that kind of unity,” Van Hollen said. “I’m disappointed in the result, but we will fight on another day.”\n \n\n   \n  The current wave of ire at Schumer comes months after the New York Democrat faced fierce backlash for diffusing that first funding fight of Trump’s second term — earning praise from GOP leaders. But this fall as another funding cliff loomed, Schumer reversed his stance and said Democrats needed to fight for expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies to help Americans pay down their premiums. Privately, Schumer was not involved in the centrist dealmaking and instead focused on keeping centrists like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire from breaking with Democrats weeks earlier, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  One of those people, who is close to Schumer, said the leader was meeting with both centrists and progressives — convincing skeptical moderates to hold out longer, through the start of open enrollment on November 1. Separately, he was also strategizing with progressive colleagues like Sen. Bernie Sanders about how to keep the momentum up in the base to keep fighting. That person said it was a months-long effort by party leaders to keep the Senate Democratic caucus in line long enough to shut down the government — and force Republicans to talk about health care — for more than six weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Schumer was indeed working against the deal behind the scenes. “Senator Schumer didn’t want this to be the outcome, and pressed hard for it not to end like this,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But he also added: “He didn’t succeed. Let’s not sugarcoat that.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether Schumer should remain as leader, Murphy instead said there must be a caucus-wide solution to centrist Democrats bucking their party to reach a deal. “This has happened over and over. You cannot defend democracy effectively if you are not united as an opposition party, and we are repeatedly showing that we are not united,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, Schumer’s long-time deputy and former roommate, ultimately broke with the Democratic leader to supply a critical vote for the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t happy about it,” Durbin told CNN when asked about Schumer’s reaction when he informed him about his position. “But he accepted it.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Schumer tried to prevent him from breaking ranks, Durbin simply said: “We passed that point.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another key difference in the circumstances of this shutdown, compared to March: Schumer is getting backup from his fellow top New Yorker, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Monday whether he believed Schumer was effective and should keep his job, Jeffries said: “Yes and yes.” In other media appearances on Monday, Jeffries has instead pinned the blame on the leading centrist in the group, Shaheen, describing her group as “random” and saying he doesn’t know her.\n \n\n   \n  On a private call among House Democrats on Monday, one member after another tore into the Senate Democratic centrists, according to two people listening to the call. One progressive, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, name-checked Schumer specifically but was particularly riled up about the handful of Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance the deal on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “Damn the senators that caved,” Jayapal said in response to those members, according to those two sources on the call. Jeffries, meanwhile, urged his caucus to direct their ire at Republicans, one of those people said — eager to avoid a circular firing squad.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, urged his party to stay focused on the “main prize.”\n \n\n   \n  “People can have their opinions about the leaders, whether it’s Jeffries or Schumer, but all of us who are really appalled by what’s going on and the loss of health care, we have to stay focused on the main prize, and that is winning the next election so we have the capacity to push back and protect America,” Welch said.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic infighting, however, has already begun.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of Washington, the loudest attacks have come from Senate Democratic candidates competing in tough primaries around the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “This happened because Chuck Schumer failed in his job yet again,” Graham Platner, a Democrat who’s in a tight primary race to flip Maine’s Senate seat, said in a  video  posted to X.\n \n\n   \n  “The old way of doing things is not working. We need new leaders in the Senate,” added Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat who is running in her own competitive primary in Maine, in a  video  trashing the deal.\n \n\n   \n  A third Democrat running in a Senate primary, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, tore into Schumer in a CNN interview on Monday, arguing that he’s not in control of the Senate Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s got eight Democrats going rogue here,” Moulton said. “That’s not leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, however, is far more muted in the current Senate Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  When asked how she felt Schumer handled the negotiation, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters, “I was disappointed yesterday.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to meet the moment and we’re not doing that.”\n \n\n   \n  Freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, though, made clear he does still back Schumer for leader.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he has confidence in Schumer, Gallego responded: “This was a decision made by eight people,” making clear he didn’t think the New York Democrat could have changed the minds of the Democrats who flipped.\n \n\n   \n  “They clearly had a momentum. They clearly had their own goals. I think we all spoke to enough of them to bring them back, but we couldn’t get all of them, and I think it was going to be difficult for them to do that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed again, Gallego said, “I have confidence in him, yeah.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/snap-benefits-recipients-struggling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Many SNAP recipients are struggling — and confused — amid legal whiplash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of SNAP recipients across the United States are facing severe financial and emotional distress due to a legal and political crisis involving inconsistent and unpredictable food stamp payments.

amid legal whiplash \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Alisha Ebrahimji, René Marsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Trena Picou heard that the US Department of Agriculture agreed last week to issue partial  food stamp benefits  for November to comply with  a federal court order , she was hopeful that she’d get around half of her usual $263 allotment. The funds would help buy meat, potatoes, beans and rice for the two teen grandsons that she and her husband are raising.\n \n\n   \n  But the Houma, Louisiana, resident only received $64, which just covered a few packs of meat, cereal and milk and nearly brought her to tears.\n \n\n   \n  A few days later, her hopes were raised again when the  USDA said  it was processing full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, payments to comply with another court order. But the judge’s ruling was quickly  blocked by the Supreme Court , which left her depressed but not surprised.\n \n\n   \n  Now, she’s pinning her hopes on Congress soon  passing a spending package  that could reopen the federal government and get full SNAP assistance flowing again to tens of millions of Americans who depend on the aid to feed themselves and their families. The couple has had to use part of their disability payments to cover the grocery tab, leaving them worried about paying for rent and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  Though she’s had to deal with the uncertainty surrounding this month’s food stamp benefits since the  USDA announced in October  that it didn’t have the funds to pay them, the twists and turns of the past week or so have been “way worse.”\n \n\n   \n  “You make plans to buy groceries and then it’s gone,” Picou, 68, said of the potential to receive their benefits. “It’s pulling the rug out from under you, and you think ‘What am I going to do now?”\n \n\n   \n   Millions of SNAP recipients  like Picou have been suffering whiplash this month, with the USDA issuing  four different guidance memos  to states about distributing at least some benefits and the  two lawsuits  that aim to force the agency to issue payments working their way through multiple levels of the US courts system. A federal judge in Rhode Island first ordered USDA to provide  at least partial benefits  but last week expanded his ruling to require the agency to pay full benefits. The Supreme Court on Friday evening temporarily paused the judge’s order to require full payments to be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate voted Monday on a  short-term spending bill  that would reopen the federal government for now but fund SNAP for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The benefits are starting to hit enrollees’ EBT cards, but it varies greatly by state. Some recipients of the program have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  With her eyes on the mail and ear to her phone, Katherine Broadway is on high alert for any piece of communication about the return of her vital food assistance, nearly $700 each month for her family of four. The only form of communication she’s received is an automated message about delayed payments from the number on the back of her benefits card.\n \n\n   \n  “It is getting absolutely frustrating for us,” she said. “We keep getting told one thing about SNAP and then five minutes later it’s not coming,” said Broadway, a retail worker from Northeast Ohio with two young daughters and a stay-at-home husband. “We are growing very impatient at this point for relief for the country in general.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the couple had to take a payday loan to afford groceries they’re hoping carry them throughout the next two weeks. Despite the stress of doing mental gymnastics to balance her pantry and refrigerator with her bank account, she is putting on a brave face for her daughters while holding onto hope that the tough times don’t last.\n \n\n   \n  “I won’t lie, I have my little mental breakdowns,” she said. “I will go in the bathroom and I will cry because I am feeling so overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  In Grand Island, Nebraska, Anthony Harris continues to wait for his family’s $389 in monthly SNAP assistance, while his mother in California received her full allotment on Friday after the Golden State rushed to distribute full benefits to its residents. He checks his EBT card daily but has yet to receive any benefits. Nebraska’s SNAP website continues to say that November payments “may be delayed or disrupted” due to the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the USDA said last week that it would provide partial and then full benefits, Harris figured he could buy more food for his 16-month-old son, Anthony, Jr, who particularly likes ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs.\n \n\n   \n  “We actually thought we’d have food this month and not have to worry,” said Harris, 46, who along with his wife, Tanya, have been going hungry at times to make sure their son has enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Now he’s doubtful that Nebraska will provide even partial benefits anytime soon. So he is going to work full time at Burger King, even though his current part-time position leaves him in great pain in his back and feet.\n \n\n   \n  Even residents who have received at least partial benefits are confused and concerned. They are worried about spending the funds on their EBT cards since they’ve heard that USDA wants states to undo the distribution, said Jimmy Chen, CEO of Propel, an app that 5.5 million SNAP households use to manage their benefits. They think they may owe money to the government if they use the cards.\n \n\n   \n  Also, those receiving partial payments are asking Propel why they received that amount. They fear that a mistake was made or that they’ll get the reduced amount going forward, Chen said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of things we’re asking families to juggle right now,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  (A Department of Justice attorney, who is representing the USDA in court, told a federal judge Monday that the agency is not looking to rescind the funds on recipients’ cards.)\n \n\n   \n  For some SNAP beneficiaries, the ever-shifting landscape has just been too much to bear.\n \n\n   \n  While Onita Norris has tried to keep up with the constantly shifting legal and political developments surrounding SNAP funding, she admits she’s not tracking every update because it just causes “unnecessary added stress.” The Martinsburg, West Virginia, resident has yet to receive any funds for November.\n \n\n   \n  For her mental health, the single mother of two young children is limiting how closely she monitors the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I could obviously use the money, but I’m not going to keep logging in (into her SNAP account) and refreshing when it seems like they haven’t figured this out,” said Norris.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reports of a potential breakthrough in Congress to end the shutdown, she remains skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Just because they say it doesn’t mean that’s what’s going to happen,” she said. “Until I actually see something hit my account, it’s very much, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it.’”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/shutdown-travel-problems-linger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Why it may take years for air travel to recover from the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A government shutdown in the United States is severely impacting air travel, with the Federal Aviation Administration mandating a 10% reduction in flight capacity at 40 major airports.

Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the government shutdown may soon be in the rearview mirror, it could leave air travel in a chokehold for months, and possibly years, to come.\n \n\n   \n  Until a deal is officially inked, airlines must continue to follow the Federal Aviation Administration’s  emergency order  to incrementally reduce flight capacity at 40 major US airports, up to 10%. Starting Tuesday, 6% of flights will be cut.\n \n\n   \n  The order calls for airlines to cancel flights seven days before they are scheduled to fly, and once they are canceled and passengers are informed, they can’t easily be reinstated.\n \n\n   \n  “There are significant challenges with these cancellations inside an airline, because it’s not easy to cancel randomly every day on 10% of our schedules and keep preserving those cancelations,” said Eash Sundaram, former chief digital and technology officer of JetBlue Airways. He now is the president of a technology venture fund called Utpata Ventures. “The airlines should be thinking about how hard it’s going to hit them in the next two to three weeks on the cancellations, and then the recovery process happens after that.”\n \n\n   \n  If controllers come back to the job, pilot and aviation consultant Kit Darby thinks it might take airlines a “week or two” to snap back.\n \n\n   \n  “If we can’t get it done this week (to end the shutdown), we’re starting to get to the point where it won’t be fully recovered by Thanksgiving,” Darby said. “I think if they do it this week, we can be very close to fully recovered by Thanksgiving.”\n \n\n   \n  However, passengers’ plans are in the hands of lawmakers to achieve a deal and secure a more reliable travel experience as the winter holidays creep closer.\n \n\n   \n    Controllers returning to work, or not\n \n\n   \n  Even when the government officially reopens, the number of controllers showing up to work might not immediately bounce back.\n \n\n   \n  Essential FAA employees who have worked during the shutdown will not immediately receive back pay, and some may choose not to return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said some of their members have taken second jobs and those side hustles may continue until they get their missed paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Nick Daniels, president of the union, said it took two to two and a half months for controllers to get all their back pay after the last shutdown in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump demanded Monday all controllers “get back to work, NOW” on Truth Social, recommending a bonus of $10,000 per controller who didn’t take time off during the shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later agreed with that sentiment, promising to work with Congress to reward controllers.\n \n\n   \n  Darby said in his experience, controllers go “above and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  “They work extra hours, extra days,” Darby said. “Been doing it for a long time, have been poorly treated. But that’s just their nature.”\n \n\n   \n    Some controllers will never come back\n \n\n   \n  Some air traffic controllers will never return to their jobs and are retiring or quitting to find work where they will not be subject to government shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told CNN, prior to the shutdown, only four controllers were retiring per day. Since the shutdown began, that’s changed to 20 to 25 retirees per day. Earlier this year the Department of Transportation offered bonuses to retirement aged controllers to stay on the job longer to help relieve the existing shortage, but the shutdown seems to be working against that effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be harder for me to come back after the shutdown and have more controllers controlling the airspace,” Duffy  told CNN on Sunday . “So, this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to have to find out how many actually resign, how many retired due to this shutdown, and truly start assessing all the different impacts the shutdown has,” Daniels said.\n \n\n   \n    The next generation\n \n\n   \n  Going into the shutdown, the nation’s air traffic control system was short by more than 3,000 workers, and a new effort to “supercharge” hiring this year has now been jeopardized by it.\n \n\n   \n  In September, before the shutdown, the DOT said it met its hiring goals for the year by recruiting more than 2,000 people. The FAA’s air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City was the “busiest” it has ever been,  an FAA official told CNN in July,  with roughly 800 to 1,000 more trainees in the pipeline than a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Classes at the academy have continued during the shutdown but left some students questioning if a job where they could have to go for weeks without pay is something they want to pursue, Duffy said. Some students have dropped out as a result.\n \n\n   \n  The funding to pay trainees is also running out, he said last month. Would-be controllers get stipends to make ends meet as they go through schooling. If that stops, it “will be cataclysmic for them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The shutdown keeps going\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the worst outcome would be if a deal takes a longer to come together or if it falls apart and the shutdown continues on for weeks more.\n \n\n   \n  On  Sunday, eight Democrats joined with Republicans  to advance the federal funding measure in exchange for a future vote on extending  enhanced Affordable Care subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  The House would also have to return and adopt the deal struck in the Senate before it is sent to President Donald Trump’s desk to be signed.\n \n\n   \n  The busy Thanksgiving travel period is just weeks away, and without a deal Duffy warned air travel could slow “to a trickle.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re going to see air traffic controllers, very few coming to work, which means you’ll have a few flights taking off and landing at different airports across the country,” Duffy said. “But for the thousands of flights that happen every day to move people around the country for the great American holiday, it’s not going to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown has not been resolved at the end of this week, there is a big risk Thanksgiving travel could be disrupted, said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group. If the shutdown is resolved no later than the end of this week or even this coming weekend, then airlines should have enough time to reassemble their schedules and get flights back operating at normal levels by the time it is Thanksgiving, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy even hinted Friday at hypothetically cutting capacity up to 20% of air traffic if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  “If (a 20% cut) happens, the US air transportation system will be crippled,” Harteveldt said. “It will be very, very difficult for travelers to get where they are going for Thanksgiving, because airlines will have exhausted all of the easy light cuts.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/style/klimt-elisabeth-lederer-auction-sothebys","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:55:00-05:00","title":"Klimt Portrait in Late Estée Lauder Heir’s Collection Could Fetch Over $150 Million at Auction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Gustav Klimt portrait of Elisabeth Lederer, a late-career masterpiece painted in 1916–1918, is set to sell for over $150 million at a Sotheby’s auction, marking a potential new record for Klimt’s work.

The Austrian painter’s record is expected to be shattered again by a monumental, six-foot-tall portrait of a young heiress that was looted by the Nazis and nearly destroyed during World War II. Rarely seen for decades, it hung in the home of the Estée Lauder heir Leonard A. Lauder until the last years of his life (he passed away in June).\n \n\n   \n  Next week, “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer” is expected to sell for above $150 million as the top lot in a sale of Lauder’s collection, hosted by Sotheby’s. The collection, which includes two other works by Klimt — both landscapes of Lake Attersee, estimated above $70 and $80 million — could fetch more than $400 million combined.\n \n\n   \n  Among the artist’s works, the portrait of Lederer, the daughter of his wealthiest Viennese patrons, is less known. Completed two years before Klimt’s death in 1918, the portrait features her in a gauzy, ornamental robe, surrounded by motifs from Chinese art. For many years, she kept a watchful eye over Lauder’s Fifth Avenue home in New York, with only occasional outings to be shown nearby, once at the Museum of Modern Art and a handful of times at Neue Galerie New York (founded by his brother). In 2017, however, Lauder loaned it to the National Gallery of Canada for its first extended stay, where it remained until earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  While in his home, the painting was a jewel of his collection, first displayed in his living room, then relocated to his dining room to make room for a large Cubist work by Fernand Léger, according to the art historian Emily Braun, who worked as Lauder’s art advisor for nearly four decades.\n \n\n   \n  “He ate lunch whenever he was at home, and lunch would be at a little round table right by the painting,” she said over the phone.\n \n\n   \n  Just a short walk away, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, millions of visitors each year pass by Klimt’s companion portrait of Lederer’s mother, Serena. Painted around 15 years prior, the stylistic shift between the two works is apparent. Serena’s portrait is wispy and spare, contrasting the bold, lush qualities of Elisabeth’s composition. Yet both have the same dark, potent gaze, Braun notes.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ll see that Klimt is either mesmerized by (Serena’s eyes), or is smart enough a painter to know to draw out this incredible coal blackness,” she commented.\n \n\n   \n    Marked by tragedy\n \n\n   \n  Both paintings avoided a calamitous end during World War II, when Nazis impounded the Lederer’s vast art collection for more than a decade. Many of their works by Klimt were shown in a 1943 exhibition in Vienna, then stored in Immendorf Castle, which burned down at the end of the war. But the family portraits, excluded from the exhibition because of their Jewish heritage, were separated and ultimately spared.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Lederer, just 20 years old at the time she sat for Klimt, was “an incredibly tragic figure,” Braun said. “Thank god this portrait survives.”\n \n\n   \n  Lederer lost everything before the war and died before it ended, at age 50, with the exact circumstances unclear. In the 1920s, as fascism began casting a long shadow, she became protestant and married a baron, but he divorced her just before World War II, the same year their young son died. Her family fled, but she remained in Vienna. She was vulnerable as a single Jewish woman, as Sotheby’s noted, so she claimed that Klimt, who died in 1918, was actually her father.\n \n\n   \n  “She was protected to a certain degree by this fabricated half-Christian, half-Klimt paternity, which was a ruse that was aided and abetted by her mother,” Braun explained. Klimt was a close family friend and her childhood drawing instructor, but he also had a reputation — allegedly fathering a number of children out of wedlock — “so this was just another example that was not far-fetched,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    A late-career masterwork\n \n\n   \n  Some works by Klimt have been the center of long sagas of  recovery and restitution , but in 1948, Lederer’s portrait was returned to her brother, Erich, who appears in drawings and paintings by Klimt’s friend and peer Egon Schiele. It remained in his possession until late in his life.\n \n\n   \n  The art dealer Serge Sabarsky acquired Lederer’s portrait in 1983, and sold it two years later to Lauder, who had taken a prudent interest in Klimt’s work. In the US, Klimt was a relatively obscure figure until the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum staged a joint exhibition with Schiele in 1965. Lauder, who was Hungarian and Czech, began collecting his works in the 1970s in part due to his own family’s ties to the region.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t emphasize enough that he was a real historian. He was fascinated by European history… and cultural history,” Braun said of Lauder. “So on the one hand, you have his direct family connection and heritage. On the other, you have the historian’s awareness of Klimt and what he represented at the apex of Viennese culture. And thirdly, you have the sheer beauty and aesthetic strength of these pictures, which he recognized immediately. He had an incredible eye.”\n \n\n   \n  Klimt may be best recognized by his golden period, during which he produced the gilded Art Nouveau icons “The Kiss” and “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” But in the years before his death, at age 55, his geometric motifs became more fluid, his brushstrokes looser, and he was greatly influenced by East Asian art, of which he was an avid collector. The figures he painted around Lederer in her portrait were likely based on works of Chinese art that Klimt owned, according to Sotheby’s, while the Chinese dragon robe she wears in the painting was meant to be a striking symbol of power. It has been said that the artist did not want to part with the painting, which took years to complete.\n \n\n   \n  For a long time, the portrait of Lederer still carried the weight of her marriage — but that changed while in Lauder’s possession. Though Lederer was just 20 years old and unmarried when Klimt painted her, her portrait was called “Portrait of Baroness Elisabeth Bachofen-Echt” when he acquired it. Braun advised Lauder to change it, she recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I said to Leonard, ‘It’s not right.’ This was commissioned while she was single. It was commissioned by her family, and her husband treated her so badly — why are we calling it by this title?” Braun said. “So we reverted to the original title, and that’s what it’s called now.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/small-plane-crash-coral-springs-fl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:56:00-05:00","title":"2 Dead After Small Plane on Hurricane Relief Mission to Jamaica Crashes in Florida Neighborhood","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small Beechcraft King Air turboprop plane, registered to International Air Services, crashed shortly after takeoff from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport in Coral Springs, Florida, on November 11, 2025, killing Alexander Wurm, 53, and his daughter Serena, 22.

 A small turboprop plane on a hurricane relief mission to Jamaica crashed Monday morning into a pond in a gated residential neighborhood of the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Coral Springs, killing two people shortly after takeoff and narrowly missing homes, authorities and a local resident said.\n \n\n   \n  The Coral Springs Police Department confirmed the deaths in a statement Monday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The victims were identified as a father and daughter: Alexander Wurm, 53, and his daughter Serena, 22, according to  Ignite the Fire Ministry .\n \n\n   \n  “Together, their final journey embodied selflessness and courage, reminding us of the power of service and love,” the group, which was founded by Alexander Wurm, said.\n \n\n   \n  Coral Springs-Parkland Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Moser said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation.\n \n\n   \n  Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the backyard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water.”\n \n\n   \n  Kenneth DeTrolio told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that he and his wife were in their home when the plane crashed through their backyard, destroying his fence and toppling palm trees before hitting the water. He said the impact left debris scattered across his yard and that his pool and back porch were “contaminated” with spilled fuel.\n \n\n   \n  The fuel smell was so strong inside his home that it took a few hours to dissipate, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard the strangest sound.

matter? \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:46 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  planet’s biggest climate conference , COP30, has kicked off with representatives from more than 190 countries descending on the Brazilian city of Belém. They will spend two weeks deep in negotiations — likely contentious — on how to rein in dangerous global warming.\n \n\n   \n  COP30 is supposed to be the summit where countries really get down to the details of how they plan to halt catastrophic climate change. There’s a huge amount at stake. Last year was the  hottest on record,  capping a  decade  of unprecedented heat, and the impacts are already roiling the planet — from  hurricanes  and  floods  to  fires  and  extreme heat .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to expect over the next two weeks.\n \n\n   \n    What are COPs?\n \n\n   \n  In 1992, more than 150 countries signed a UN treaty to limit the alarming rise of planet-heating pollution.  The first COP — which stands for “conference of the parties” that signed this agreement — took place in Berlin in 1995. Member states have been convening almost every year since.\n \n\n   \n  A breakthrough moment came in 2015. At COP21 in Paris, more than 190 countries approved the  Paris climate agreement , pledging limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement set out a vision but not a detailed roadmap. To flesh out how the warming limit would be achieved, countries committed to submit national climate plans every five years for keeping the 1.5-degree ambition alive.\n \n\n   \n  COP30 marks the latest cycle of these. Countries were supposed to submit their plans for cutting climate pollution up to 2035 by a February deadline.  More than 90%  of governments missed it. Most countries  have now submitted  their plans, but some, including big polluters like India, have not.\n \n\n   \n    Why has COP30 been controversial?\n \n\n   \n  The pathway to the summit has been chaotic.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s choice of Belém as the COP30 location was symbolic. The city is known as the “gateway to the Amazon,” and the aim was to focus minds on the existential danger the vast rainforest faces.\n \n\n   \n  But Belém was not set up for the influx that accompanies COP. The city typically has around 18,000 hotel rooms and is expecting roughly 50,000 people. A dearth of lodgings meant rates spiked, and some countries said they  were being priced out  of the conference and out of the rooms where decisions were being made about their survival.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil also faced criticism for its decision last month to  approve exploratory oil drilling  at the mouth of the Amazon River, only a few hundred miles from Belém. Environmental advocates accused the COP30 host of hypocrisy.\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has made tackling deforestation a core aim and used the COP30 summit opening on Monday to speak  strongly in favor  of tackling the climate crisis. But he also supports oil extraction and has rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a pre-summit meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible” for Brazil to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n    What are the main issues at COP30?\n \n\n   \n  Forests are high on the agenda. Brazil is keen to make this the “Amazon COP,” and Lula wants to raise $125 billion for a fund that would pay countries to protect their forests.\n \n\n   \n  The most contentious issues at the summit are likely to be around finance and fossil fuels.\n \n\n   \n  The wrangle over how much richer countries should give poorer ones to help them tackle climate change and adapt to the impacts they disproportionately face is likely to continue.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, at COP29 in Azerbaijan, nations agreed to  provide $300 billion annually by 2035 , with a wider ambition to reach $1.3 trillion from a range of sources. A roadmap for scaling up climate finance was published last week and will form the basis for what are likely to be contentious negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Then there are fossil fuels, the drivers of the climate crisis, which were mentioned in a COP final agreement  for the first time only in 2023  at COP28, when countries made an unprecedented call to transition away from oil, coal and gas.\n \n\n   \n  The world is different now, however. Trump is pushing for more fossil fuels, and some countries,  including many in South America , are rushing to exploit their oil and gas reserves. Petrostates and oil companies are  increasingly emboldened  to push back against any  language blaming fossil fuels  for climate change or committing to phasing them out.\n \n\n   \n    Does the world have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees?\n \n\n   \n  The  United Nations says no , at least not in the near term. In a report this month, the UN said countries had acted too slowly to limit climate pollution and it was all but certain the world would exceed 1.5 degrees, at least in the near term.\n \n\n   \n  Based on current policies, the world is on track for 2.8 degrees of warming, according to the UN. If governments’ new pledges for the future are met, this could be brought down to 2.3 to 2.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  It is progress; a decade ago, the planet was on course for around a 4-degree temperature rise.

blocked in China as part of the government’s vast censorship apparatus known as the ‘Great Firewall’.\n \n\n   \n  China operates one of the world’s  most extensive  online censorship and surveillance regimes that scrubs political dissent and criticism of the ruling Communist Party’s leadership and  ideologies , including a drive against feminine portrayals of men in pop culture.\n \n\n   \n  China’s LGBTQ+ community has faced an intensifying crackdown since Xi Jinping came to power more than a decade ago. Authorities have ramped up control over what they consider the undue influence of Western values, with  Pride parades canceled,  films and TV shows featuring same-sex themes banned, and China’s most popular messaging app WeChat  shutting down dozens of LGBTQ accounts. \n \n\n   \n  There has been no official announcement about the apps’ removal from the app stores in China, where regulators routinely remove content without explanation. But a source familiar with the matter told CNN that it appeared to be related to compliance issues.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Apple, Blued, Finka and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The apps have been accused of carrying pornography or “vulgar content” on its platforms, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple said it removed the apps from its China store after a request from the country’s internet regulator,  tech website Wired reported .\n \n\n   \n  “Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,” the phone maker said in a statement to Wired, adding: “We follow the laws in the countries where we operate.”\n \n\n   \n  Blued’s international version HeeSay remains searchable on app stores outside of China, while Finka operates solely within the country.\n \n\n   \n  The apps are hugely popular, with Blued reported as having 54 million registered users worldwide in 2020 and Finka 2.7 million, according to state media CGTN.\n \n\n   \n    Tightening space\n \n\n   \n  The latest narrowing of LGBTQ+ space came as the Supreme Court in the US  declined to revisit  its landmark precedent recognizing same-sex marriage. The Trump administration, however, has been scaling back federal diversity programs while piling pressure on the private sector to end similar initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 but does not recognize same-sex marriage.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time China has reined in gay-dating apps. Grindr, which targets the international market, was removed from mobile app stores in China in 2022, citing difficulties to comply with a new privacy law.\n \n\n   \n  Blued, launched in 2012 to offer the local market a more approachable alternative, continued to operate alongside its rival Finka, which targets a younger demographic.\n \n\n   \n  Blued’s parent company BlueCity acquired Finka in 2020, a year after its debut.\n \n\n   \n  One user, surnamed Zhao, told CNN that the two apps enabled friends to meet especially in the less cosmopolitan parts of the country where places for gay people to gather are almost non-existent.\n \n\n   \n  “I just feel that there hasn’t been that much space offline for the gay community to begin with. Now that the online space is also being restricted, I feel that the space of the community is getting smaller and smaller,” said the 30-year-old, who gave only his family name for fear of speaking out against the authorities.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if their removal from Chinese app stores is permanent.\n \n\n   \n  Reinstatement is possible if the companies take steps to comply with Chinese regulators, the source who spoke to CNN said, although they were not optimistic, citing the tightening “ideological environment.”\n \n\n   \n  “Things are just difficult right now,” the source said, adding that Blued would likely have to “lay low and even transform” to survive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/india/india-new-delhi-pollution-diwali-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:50:00-11:11","title":"After festival of lights, New Delhi plunged into toxic darkness and world’s most polluted air","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced one of the worst air pollution episodes in recent history, with PM2.5 levels more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s recommended annual limit.

during which revelers typically set off fireworks and firecrackers.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday, New Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration – a measure of pollutants in the air – was more than 40 times the

are typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/cars/tesla-china-sales-fall-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00Z","title":"Tesla’s China sales fall to 3-year low amid tepid demand","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tesla’s sales in China dropped to 26,006 vehicles in October 2025, its lowest in three years, amid declining demand and a shrinking market share to just 3.2%, down from 8.7% the previous month.

10:47 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Israeli parliament advanced two controversial bills on Monday, including one that would expand the use of the death penalty for convicted “terrorists” and individuals found guilty of nationalistically motivated murder.\n \n\n   \n  The death penalty bill, championed by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, passed its first reading by 39 votes to 16. It now moves to a parliamentary committee for further debate and preparation ahead of the second and third readings.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Gvir has argued the measure would “ create substantial deterrence ” against terrorism and he threatened to withdraw his party from Israel’s coalition government if the bill was not put to a vote.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza. However, he has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Israel currently allows the death penalty only in exceptional cases, including for crimes such as treason and war crimes committed under the Nazi regime, but it has not been used for decades.\n \n\n   \n  The only person ever executed in Israel was Adolf Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust,  who was hanged in 1962  after he famously was  captured by Israeli intelligence agents in Argentina  and subsequently convicted in a landmark trial.\n \n\n   \n  Before Monday’s vote, Ben Gvir  declared on X  that “History will judge anyone who dares today to raise a finger against the death penalty law for terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill also amends the military courts law, with jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, allowing courts there to impose the death penalty by a simple majority vote on the judge’s panel instead of a unanimous vote. It also rules out any option of allowing extenuating circumstances in the sentencing. Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law.\n \n\n   \n  The UN has previously condemned Israel’s military courts in the occupied West Bank, saying that “Palestinians’ right to due process guarantees have been violated” for decades, and denounced “the lack of fair trial in the occupied West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  UN experts said last year that, “in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution – the Israeli military.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign media bill\n \n\n   \n  In the same session, lawmakers also approved the first reading of a separate bill that would allow the Israeli government to shut down foreign media outlets without a court order.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal seeks to formalize what has been dubbed the “Al Jazeera Law,” after the Qatari network’s operations in Israel  were shuttered in 2024  by the Ministry of Communications. The ministry accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas through its coverage of the Gaza war.\n \n\n   \n  Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied those accusations and  condemned its closure  in Israel. Multiple Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza have also been killed by Israeli forces over the last two years.\n \n\n   \n  The new foreign media legislation, introduced by Likud lawmaker Ariel Kallner and backed by Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition, would make such powers permanent — even outside times of war or national emergency — and remove the requirement for judicial oversight.\n \n\n   \n  Reporters Without Borders (RSF)  condemned the proposal , calling it “the first nail in the coffin of broadcast media’s editorial independence in Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  “Against a backdrop of war and an upcoming election campaign, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is seeking to silence voices critical of the far-right coalition in power,” said RSF editorial director Anne Bocandé. “These legislative attacks will have lasting, negative consequences on Israel’s media landscape,” she warned.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/markets/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"21:59:00Z","title":"Warren Buffett: ‘I’m going quiet’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warren Buffett, the 95-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has announced he will step down at the end of 2025, marking the end of a 60-year leadership era.

‘I’m going quiet’ \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:59 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Warren Buffett,  in his annual message  as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway to shareholders – a tradition dating back to 1965 – said that he will be “going quiet” after he steps down at the end of this year. But the 95-year-old is not going away just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett will no longer write the message atop the company’s annual report, but he will continue to deliver an annual Thanksgiving message, and he will “step up” his philanthropy, giving away the $149 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock he continues to hold.\n \n\n   \n  “The Oracle of Omaha” has become an investing icon, a billionaire who has cultivated a folksy image, particularly through his letters to shareholders. Although his market moves are closely followed by investors around the world, Buffett has also worked to present himself as a cheerleader for America and ordinary Americans – and for capitalism.\n \n\n   \n  He is being replaced by Greg Abel next year. Abel, 63, is the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire and was designated as Buffett’s successor in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett once again praised his successor, writing that he “has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO.”\n \n\n   \n  Buffett   also gave an update on his health, admitting that to his “surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.”\n \n\n   \n  But the nonagenarian isn’t getting any younger. Acknowledging the limited time he has left and the giant sum of money he wishes to give away, Buffett said he converted 1,800 shares, worth a combined $1.35 billion, into the company’s cheaper “B shares” and delivered them to four of his family’s foundations Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett says he has high – but realistic – expectations that the conglomerate he led for six decades will continue to thrive after he steps down as CEO. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) shares have risen more than 10% this year, with the company sitting on a $1 trillion market cap.\n \n\n   \n  “In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems,” he wrote. “However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.”\n \n\n   \n    The oracle and his ice cream\n \n\n   \n  Buffett has managed to become a symbol of two seemingly disparate things over his decades in the spotlight: a relentless dealmaker and capitalist, wrapped up in an avuncular figure dispensing practical advice.\n \n\n   \n  Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings are like those of no other company, dubbed Woodstock for capitalists, with an exhibit floor showing off many of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Buffett himself makes a point to appear on the floor and hype up those companies, from eating Dairy Queen ice cream to putting his face and name on limited-edition event merch, all while his security keeps back hordes of shareholding fans trying to take pictures or get a word in with the so-called Oracle of Omaha.\n \n\n   \n  His investing strategy has turned on an incessant search for value, with Berkshire Hathaway often sitting on giant piles of cash until just the right deal comes through. Few other CEOs have earned that level of patience from investors in a market that more often turns on expectations for short-term returns.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett expects the company to move on from him. But so much of Berkshire’s identity has become intertwined with its CEO. It’s hard to imagine the low-profile Greg Abel, for example, putting  his face on a ketchup bottle  to spur sales. Woodstock for capitalists might get just a little less festive from now on.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/asia/suharto-indonesia-national-hero-explainer-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:15","title":"Suharto, US-backed dictator, posthumously named national hero of Indonesia sparking global outcry","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"General Suharto, a long-time US-backed authoritarian leader of Indonesia, ruled for 31 years from 1966 to 1998, during which he oversaw a violent anti-communist purge in 1965 that killed between 500,000 and 1 million people, including ethnic Chinese and leftist groups.

Why is he now being named a national hero? \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For decades, he was a feared US-backed dictator whose regime oversaw bloody Cold War-era massacres, accused of diverting huge amounts of state money to propel his family into luxury and political power.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, he was posthumously named a national hero of Indonesia – prompting protests from human rights groups and victims who decried the award as whitewashing a repressive regime that left hundreds of thousands dead, according to historians.\n \n\n   \n  Former President Suharto was granted the title in a ceremony by Indonesia’s current leader, Prabowo Subianto – Suharto’s former son-in-law, himself a divisive figure as a former general who faced his own allegations of human rights abuses while in uniform.\n \n\n   \n  “A prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,” an announcer said during the award presentation,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  But as the roiling controversy shows, that characterization is hotly debated – and Suharto’s legacy is anything but straightforward.\n \n\n   \n    Who was Suharto?\n \n\n   \n  Born in 1921 when Indonesia was still a Dutch colony, Suharto rose to power after the country gained independence in 1949, climbing the army ranks to become a five-star general.\n \n\n   \n  Then came a bloodbath in 1965, sparked by a failed coup and the murder of a number of generals in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto blamed the coup on communists, ousted then-President Sukarno – the country’s first post-independence leader – and sanctioned a hunt for those responsible.\n \n\n   \n  What ensued was a nationwide purge of alleged communists overseen by Suharto’s powerful military, with human rights groups and historians estimating that between 500,000 to one million people were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The United States supported the anti-communist massacres, providing lists of senior communist party officials, equipment and money to the Indonesian army, according to official documents that were  declassified in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  In one document in late 1965, the US embassy in Jakarta sent a cable to Washington calling the crackdowns a “fantastic switch which has occurred over 10 short weeks,” along with an estimate that 100,000 people had been slaughtered, according to  the Associated Press .\n \n\n   \n  Many contend that those targeted during the purges were not communists but ethnic Chinese, or anyone with left wing views.\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, an international tribunal at the Hague found that the US, United Kingdom, and Australia were  all complicit  in the mass killings of 1965, which were deemed crimes against humanity.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto stayed in power for 31 years, during which he cracked down on critics and political opponents, and enforced his regime’s rule over territories including East Timor, Aceh, West  Papua  and the Maluku islands.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those territories were invaded with the tacit support of Western allies keen to prop up an anti-communist leader, at a time when proxy conflicts backed by the US and the Soviet Union raged across the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  He is praised by some for policies that fueled rapid economic growth and relative political stability. But at the same time, he siphoned off huge sums of money from state coffers, funding his family’s rich lifestyle and fueling public resentment.\n \n\n   \n  His rule finally came to an end in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis threw the country into economic turmoil, prompting widespread protests and forcing Suharto to resign – one of the last people power movements to sweep Southeast Asia and replace a Cold War-era autocrat with democracy.\n \n\n   \n  In the following years, Suharto’s children were prosecuted, and his youngest was convicted of corruption. In 2015, the Supreme Court ordered Suharto’s family to  pay back millions  in embezzled funds to the state.\n \n\n   \n  But Suharto himself never answered to his victims. Due to health problems in his final years, he died in 2008 without ever standing trial. He denied any wrongdoing until his death, at one point calling the embezzlement allegations “slander and defamation.”\n \n\n   \n    Why would Prabowo name Suharto a national hero?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not lost on many that Suharto was granted the posthumous honor by Prabowo – a longtime supporter of Suharto’s regime, and once a part of the strongman’s family.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo married Suharto’s daughter in 1983, though they divorced after Suharto was forced from power.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was also a military commander during Suharto’s reign and served in controversial campaigns in West Papua and East Timor, casting doubts over his own human rights record. He is accused of kidnapping activists during the 1998 mass protests that led to Suharto’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo has always denied the allegations that led to his dismissal from the military in 1998, the same year Indonesia broke free from Suharto’s authoritarian rule.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was  elected president in 2024  – with Suharto’s  former party, Golkar , throwing its support behind the candidate. During  his victory speech , Prabowo paid tribute to Suharto and thanked his ex-wife.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, some human rights experts voiced concerns that his presidency risked backsliding on the democratic gains made since Suharto’s authoritarian regime.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Prabowo has expanded the military’s role into what were considered civilian areas, measures  heavily criticized  by civil society groups who say it would bring Indonesia back to Suharto-era militarism and authoritarianism.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Prabowo’s involvement, there are also still a number of Suharto loyalists in Indonesia. His political heirs have also tried to  redeem his image  in the last decade, portraying him instead as a strong leader who brought stability to the country.\n \n\n   \n  In places like Kemusuk, a village near Yogyakarta where he was born, his image is everywhere – from museum memorabilia celebrating his life to the souvenir T-shirts with his smiling face.\n \n\n   \n  Discussion of his rule remains largely taboo in Indonesia, with mixed opinions about his legacy.\n \n\n   \n    What has been the response?\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the ceremony on Monday, activists gathered last week in Jakarta to protest against the act, holding placards that read: “Human rights violator” and “Suharto is not a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups lambasted the choice, with Amnesty International describing it as an attempt to rewrite history and pointing out Prabowo’s familial ties to Suharto.\n \n\n   \n  Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, also condemned the move.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure to hold (Soharto) and his abusive generals to account facilitates the whitewashing and distortion of history that is now taking place under Prabowo,” he wrote  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  “This will make it even harder for Indonesian authorities now, and in the future, to end impunity for serious human rights violations and obtain justice for the victims and their families.”\n \n\n   \n  The title especially stings for the many survivors of violence and persecution under Suharto’s rule – and the families of his victims.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked, disappointed and angry with this government’s absurd decision,” Bedjo Untung told the  Associated Press.  Untong was imprisoned without trial for alleged Communist links between 1970-1979, during which he was tortured and his family faced hardship and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels deeply unfair, we are still living with the suffering until today,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto’s defenders have taken a different view.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to defend it ourselves… nothing is being hidden,” Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, Suharto’s daughter, told journalists after the ceremony on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have expressed our gratitude to the president for appointing our father as the national hero and maybe because he is also a soldier so he knows what my father had done,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senate-vote-negotiations-deal-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"1010-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00-05:00","title":"Negotiations Break Down 38-Day Government Shutdown After Moderate Democrats Agree to Bipartisan Deal with Republican Leader John Thune","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 38 days of a government shutdown, moderate Democratic senators including Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, Angus King, and Tim Kaine broke ranks to support a bipartisan agreement with Republican Majority Leader John Thune, ending the impasse.

Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, Angus King and Tim Kaine had yielded a deal that  eight Democrats broke ranks  to advance. By Monday evening, the Senate had  voted 60-40   to pass the measure, which now heads to the House before  President Donald Trump  – who’s signaled support — can sign anything.\n \n\n   \n  The government could now be reopened by the end of the week. What comes next is far less certain, with questions looming about the fallout for both parties as Democrats face internal recriminations and Republicans are forced to grapple with the political liabilities of rising health care premiums.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has sought to limit its public comments on the deal, wary of disrupting a tentative agreement that still faces a tricky path through the House. But internally, the sudden end to the impasse prompted a sense of vindication that the outcome that officials had predicted for weeks had finally come to pass, people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his top aides had decided in September to take a hard line against negotiating with Democrats, confident that the party would cave as soon as it became clear they wouldn’t win any concessions from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he made a mistake in going too far,” Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in an interview Monday about Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the deal later Monday but who had been kept in the loop on the moderates’ conversations with Thune, one of the sources familiar said.\n \n\n   \n  “He just went too far. He thought he could break the Republicans, and the Republicans broke him,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  But reaching that point took far longer than anyone in the White House anticipated; many officials believed Democrats would fold in a matter of hours to days. It also came at a cost, with Trump and Republicans taking the brunt of the public blame for the shutdown, culminating in a brutal set of state-level electoral losses last week.\n \n\n   \n  Spooked by those results, Trump in recent days had begun urging Republicans to abandon their strategy and unilaterally open the government by  eliminating the filibuster  — an idea that proved deeply unpopular with GOP leaders and succeeded only in dividing his party.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even as urgency built within the administration to find an end to the shutdown, officials contended that a similar level of pressure must be building on the Democratic side. In the weeks leading up to Sunday’s breakthrough, Trump aides  had privately discussed minor concessions  they might be willing to make to help Republican senators clinch an eventual deal, two people familiar with the deliberations said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, few expected the opportunity would come when it did, with Democrats riding high from the elections and their base louder than ever in urging them to hold the line.\n \n\n   \n  As the talks between Democratic moderates and Thune accelerated, some of the potential concessions that aides had contemplated quickly became a central component of the bipartisan agreement, as Democrats pressed for a reversal of the mass firings of federal workers that the administration had carried out during the shutdown and protections against future layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The White House agreed. On Monday, Kaine told CNN that a provision barring further reductions in force through January had been key to convincing him to sign on to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one negotiating the federal worker protections, and when I got a yes from the White House at 4:45 yesterday on the key component of guaranteeing no future RIFs, that was very persuasive to me,” the Virginia Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were also able to secure furloughed federal employees’ back pay — but not the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that had been their original and consistent demand.\n \n\n   \n  The acceptance of the deal came from a realization among Democrats that Republicans simply were not going to cave on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The question I was wrestling with is: if the tactic isn’t working and there were no prospects that it was going to work, then let’s move on, not make a lot of other people suffer in order to get a goal that wasn’t attainable,” King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  There was immediate blowback. Leading Democratic figures and potential 2028 presidential candidates railed against the deal and its negotiators. House Democratic leadership even urged their members to put out statements calling on Democratic senators to hold the line Sunday night, a source familiar with the messaging push told CNN, and a range of House Democrats rushed to announce their “no” votes.\n \n\n   \n  But within the group of eight Democratic senators, the lawmakers argued that they’d made the only sensible move available, especially as the pain mounted for everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome,” said Shaheen, who’s not running for reelection to her New Hampshire seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  While the quartet of Democratic former governors had worked in overdrive through a combination of meetings and phone calls out of King’s Senate hideaway, those negotiations hadn’t just begun over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, Hassan — also from New Hampshire — and King had been quietly talking with Republican leadership for weeks to lay the groundwork for a deal. Thune had long said that the path toward a deal would be through conversations with rank-and-file Democrats, not Democratic leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine told reporters that he spoke with Thune and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama throughout the negotiations over the weekend and made the case directly that the deal needed to include a moratorium on firings of federal employees.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether he wished Democrats had cut a deal sooner, Kaine, who didn’t truly join the negotiations until after Tuesday’s elections, said of Republicans: “I didn’t fully understand how dug in they were.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, moderate Democrats had agreed to give Schumer and their fellow Democratic senators one last shot to do it their way on Friday, filing into the chamber behind the New York Democrat as he presented his party’s latest offer to open the government in exchange for extending the ACA subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans rejected it as a nonstarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan A was over on Friday when Republicans ruled it out,” one of the sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The eventual deal they did accept, however, presents a new quandary for the GOP. With Thune promising a separate vote on the subsidies next month, White House aides are already turning their attention to hashing out a coherent position on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the question is how they push back on the inevitable Democratic narrative that Republicans are killing health care in the US,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “What is the Republican response to the inevitable refrain: ‘They don’t have a plan.’”\n \n\n   \n  Said Shaheen: “We have a guaranteed vote by a guaranteed date on a bill that we will write, not that the Republicans will write.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on Republicans’ message on health care during a Fox Business interview on Monday, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair indicated the answer remained a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a good plan to be able to address some of these issues that will begin to be worked on in earnest now,” Blair said, without offering specifics. “I expect that we’ll see action on that very soon.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-china-france-students-universities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"21:55:00-05:00","title":"Trump defends enrolling Chinese students at US universities — and takes a swipe at France","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the enrollment of Chinese students at U.S. universities, asserting that international students from countries like China bring valuable intellectual capital, while dismissing France as a preferable alternative.

Samantha Waldenberg, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:55 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  criticized the nation of France on Monday in a back-and-forth with a Fox News host as he defended the enrollment of Chinese students at universities in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually think it’s good to have outside countries,” the president said when asked about enrolling Chinese nationals at American universities.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not the French. They’re the Chinese. They spy on us. They steal our intellectual property,” Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham responded.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you think the French are better?” the president retorted.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah,” Ingraham said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not so sure,” the president responded.\n \n\n   \n  There has been some tension between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron throughout Trump’s second term.

Senate votes to end government shutdown, sending funding bill to the House \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:50 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A small band of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on Monday night to approve a funding measure to reopen the federal government — without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford insurance.\n \n\n   \n  The funding compromise will now go to the House, where GOP leaders are hopeful it could pass as soon as Wednesday and end the longest-ever US shutdown. The recently struck deal, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign, would restore critical services like federal food aid, as well as pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  Eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus crossed the aisle to join with Republicans in the 60 to 40 vote. One Republican voted in opposition: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  That shutdown has been politically painful on Capitol Hill. Republicans have repeatedly shouldered blame in  recent polling  for the funding lapse. And the deal, struck by Democratic centrists in the Senate, has ignited a fight within the party about its strategy in the already 41-day funding fight — and where they go next.\n \n\n   \n  Most Democrats were eager to keep fighting even as centrists declared that with Trump dug in, there was no real chance of securing policy wins on health care. Instead, those centrists secured the promise of a future vote on a health care bill of their choosing, which Democrats are determined to win GOP support on. It is far from guaranteed, however, that the bill will survive the Senate, let alone the House.\n \n\n   \n  The vote late Monday night caps a frenetic few days of negotiations inside the US Capitol, with quiet negotiations between the Senate centrists, GOP leaders and the White House throughout the weekend before formally unveiling their deal on Sunday. A bloc of eight members of the Democratic caucus took a critical first step to support that measure Sunday night, and all eight gave it final approval on Monday night.\n \n\n   \n  Those eight lawmakers were: Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Jeanne Shaheen, Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman, Jacky Rosen and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  While he did not vote for the final deal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has drawn fury from the party’s left for allowing those centrists to strike the deal without any real wins on the Affordable Care Act subsidies that will soon expire and hike premiums for millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Many Democrats in both chambers believe the party will be forced to relive the fight again on January 30, when the next tranche of funding runs out. The broader legislative package, however, would fund several key agencies, including ones that run federal food aid, as well as the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program, and veterans programs, through the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Now, attention will turn to House Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the House, who are making their way to Washington after being in their districts since mid-September.\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to vote on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government as early as 4 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The notice forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican speaker is likely to need the president’s help to muscle the package through his fractious conference in the coming days. But in an optimistic sign Monday, Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins “I would say so” when asked if he personally approved of the deal making its way through the process on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ellis Kim contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/us/ashlee-buzzard-arrest-melodee-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:09:00-05:00","title":"Mother of missing 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard is arrested, officials say not related to her daughter’s disappearance","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 9-year-old girl, Melodee Buzzard, went missing during a road trip in October 2025 from Lompoc, California.

more importantly, they’re transactional \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  So much of the coverage of President Donald Trump’s pardons is focused on how political they are. And they are certainly political — extraordinarily so.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s  latest batch of pardons  reinforces, that’s only half the story.\n \n\n   \n  The more ominous trend is not just that he’s pardoning political allies; it’s that he’s pardoning allies  in very transactional ways .\n \n\n   \n  He’s pardoning lots and lots of people who helped Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  After previously dangling pardons over allies involved in sensitive investigations involving Trump himself — and later delivering those pardons — he’s now pardoned oodles of people who took illegal or legally dubious action on his behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is creating a permission structure in which people will credibly think they can’t be held accountable in federal court, as long as what they’re doing benefits Trump. He’s been cultivating this for a long time, but he seems to be getting more brazen about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most recent pardons, which were announced overnight by Justice Department official Ed Martin, are for 77 people who played roles in trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. These officials include former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, along with many of the people involved in the so-called fake electors scheme.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons are symbolic, in that these people haven’t actually been charged with federal crimes. Some of them face state-level charges, for which Trump cannot pardon them.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s also what makes these so notable. Trump is using this symbolic gesture to expand the ranks of people who went to great and legally dubious lengths to help him try to overturn the 2020 election and who later received pardons.\n \n\n   \n  When you combine these new pardons with the pardons and commutations given to  January 6, 2021, defendants  and Trump allies who testified in cases involving the president, across his two terms Trump has now pardoned more than 1,650 people who played significant roles in matters involving him personally.\n \n\n   \n  Those people account for more than 84% of pardons and commutations awarded by Trump. (Trump has otherwise  been remarkably stingy  with his clemency powers, when the matters didn’t involve him or his allies.)\n \n\n   \n  And many of these people engaged in violence,  including against police , in the name of helping Trump.\n \n\n   \n  What message does that send to other people who might go to remarkable lengths to help Trump carry out his agenda? To participate in legally dubious administration actions — things like  its boat strikes in the Caribbean ? To carry out his deportation agenda in rather brutal ways? Or to perhaps even try to help him stay in power, as more than 1,600 people did before receiving pardons for their actions?\n \n\n   \n  The sheer volume of these self-serving pardons is hardly the only indicator that Trump is wielding them for political and transactional purposes.\n \n\n   \n  Official reports from the various Russia investigations referred to how Trump  appeared to dangle pardons  over people who were in positions to provide potentially derogatory information about him. These people included former advisers Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  Special counsel Robert Mueller  said in his report  that Trump’s repeated comments about potentially pardoning Manafort “had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government.”\n \n\n   \n  All were later pardoned by Trump in his first term. And perhaps most notably, Trump’s pardon of Manafort came after Manafort lied to investigators in ways that threw them off in a key portion of the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Manafort’s lies came after he cut a deal to cooperate with investigators. A bipartisan Senate report seemed to  regard these lies as particularly inexplicable , given they opened Manafort up to much more prison time.\n \n\n   \n  But ultimately, Manafort’s gamble appeared to pay off with Trump, when the president gave him the pardon he had repeatedly dangled as a potential reward for staying loyal.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Mueller report and the Senate report also referred to how Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he was led to believe the Trump White House would help him with his pardon  if he stayed in line.\n \n\n   \n  Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he discussed a potential pardon with a  fellow Trump lawyer more than half a dozen times. He said the lawyer told him after he testified to Congress that Trump “heard that you did great, and don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. He loves ya.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani himself also publicly floated pardons related to witnesses in the Russia investigation. He at one point  told the New York Daily News  that when “the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.” He  told CNN  around the same time that “When it’s over, hey, he’s the president of the United States. He retains his pardon power. Nobody is taking that away from him.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the comments of another lawyer who figured prominently in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, John Eastman.\n \n\n   \n  Just a few days after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Eastman  emailed Giuliani , saying, “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works.”\n \n\n   \n  We still don’t know who was keeping such a “pardon list,” or why. But it signaled that those around Trump seemed to sense their actions were at least legally problematic and were preparing accordingly very shortly after January 6.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some involved had either been  told their plans were illegal or acknowledged it  in the days and weeks beforehand, but they pressed forward anyway. Then they rather quickly seemed to start talking about pardons.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years later, Eastman has joined Giuliani in actually being on a Trump “pardon list.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/hannibal-gadhafi-released-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Hannibal Gadhafi, Son of Late Libyan Leader, Released by Lebanon After 10 Years in Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hannibal Gadhafi, the son of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was released from Lebanese detention after 10 years, following a $900,000 bail payment by a Libyan delegation.

His lawyers said at the time that he didn’t have enough to pay that amount, and sought permission for him to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, his bail was reduced to 80 billion Lebanese pounds (about $900,000) and the travel ban was lifted allowing him to leave the country once he pays the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The two judicial and one security official said the bail was paid by the Libyan delegation. The Justice Ministry of the Tripoli-based government also posted on its social media platforms that the Libyan delegation paid the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The judicial officials in Beirut said Gadhafi’s defense team withdrew a case against the Lebanese state that they had filed in Geneva last month over holding him without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Libya formally requested Hannibal Gadhafi’s release in 2023, citing his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike to protest his detention without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Detained in Lebanon in 2015, Gadhafi was accused of withholding information about the fate of Lebanese Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr who disappeared during a trip to Libya in 1978, although the late leader’s son was less than 3 years old at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Gadhafi had been living in exile in Syria with his Lebanese wife, Aline Skaf, and children until he was abducted in 2015 and brought to Lebanon by Lebanese militants who were demanding information about al-Sadr.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanese police later announced they had seized Gadhafi from the northeastern Lebanese city of Baalbek where he was being held, and he had been held ever since in a Beirut jail, where he faced questioning over al-Sadr’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. The cleric’s family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume he is dead. He would be 96 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sadr, who went missing with companions Abbas Badreddine and Mohammed Yacoub, was the founder of a Shiite political and military group that took part in the long Lebanese Civil War that began in 1975, largely pitting Muslims against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi was  killed by opposition fighters  during Libya’s 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.\n \n\n   \n  Hannibal Gadhafi, who was born nearly three years before al-Sadr disappeared, fled to Algeria after his father was toppled and Tripoli fell to opposition fighters, along with his mother and several other relatives. He later moved to Syria where he was given political asylum and stayed there until he was abducted.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi had eight children from two marriages. Most of them had significant roles in his government. His son Muatassim was killed at the same time as the leader was captured and slain. Two other sons, Saif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed in the uprising.\n \n\n   \n   Saif al-Islam , the one-time heir apparent to his father, has been in Libya since his release from detention there in 2017.

He said that since reading it, he looks more closely when he walks past bouncers standing in the doorways of Dublin pubs.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of giving him a second look, because I feel I might know him a bit better,” said Doyle, whose funny, poignant stories of working-class Dublin life won him the 1993 Booker Prize for “Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha.”\n \n\n   \n  “It presents us with a certain type of man that invites us to look behind the face.”\n \n\n   \n  Szalay, who was born in Canada, raised in the UK and lives in Vienna, was previously a Booker finalist in 2016 for “All That Man Is,” a series of stories about nine wildly different men.\n \n\n   \n  “Flesh” was praised by many critics but frustrated others with its refusal to fill in the gaps in István’s story – great swathes of life, including incarceration and wartime service in Iraq occur off the page – and its stubbornly unexpressive central character, whose most common remark is “Okay.”\n \n\n   \n  “We loved the spareness of the writing,” Doyle said. “We loved how so much was revealed without us being overly aware that it was being revealed … Watching this man grow, age, and learning so much about him – despite him, in a way.\n \n\n   \n  “If the gaps were filled, it would be less of a book,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay was considered an outsider for this year’s prize but had been rising up bookmakers’ odds in the days before Monday’s ceremony.\n \n\n   \n  The front-runners according to betting markets were British writer Miller for early-1960s domestic drama “The Land in Winter” and Indian author Desai for globe-spanning saga “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” her first novel since “The Inheritance of Loss,” which won the Booker Prize in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  The other finalists were Susan Choi’s twisty family saga “Flashlight”; Katie Kitamura’s tale of acting and identity, “Audition”; and midlife-crisis road trip “The Rest of Our Lives” by Ben Markovits.\n \n\n   \n  The Booker Prize was founded in 1969 and has established a reputation for transforming writers’ careers. Its winners have included Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, Arundhati Roy, Margaret Atwood and Samantha Harvey, who took the 2024 prize for space station story “Orbital.”\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-search-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-20:44","title":"Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 9-year-old girl, Melodee Buzzard, disappeared in October 2025 after her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, took her on a 1,000-mile multistate road trip across six states, including to Nebraska.

a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:24 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s been a month since Ashlee Buzzard packed her 9-year-old daughter Melodee into a rental car and left their home state of California — only to return three days later with no child and plenty of unanswered questions in tow, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  As investigators  search for Melodee , they say their probe has uncovered a series of wigged disguises, a sprawling multistate road trip, and an “uncooperative” mother who has provided “no verifiable explanation” of her daughter’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The case took an unexpected turn on Friday when  Buzzard, 40, was arrested  on a charge of false imprisonment — but not for the disappearance of her daughter. “This crime is not connected to the ongoing search for Melodee, however, detectives are unable to fully outline the crime as it would impede their ongoing investigation,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the case — and the many questions that still remain.\n \n\n   \n    A concerned school official noticed Melodee’s ‘prolonged absence’\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on October 14, not by her family but by school administrators who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in.\n \n\n   \n  School district officials in the child’s hometown of Lompoc say Melodee was enrolled in August in an independent study program, which allows students to learn from home. That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away — as far as Nebraska — crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard has been charged with a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She is being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say the incident happened in Lompoc on November 6 and involved a person who is not Melodee, but investigators have so far been reluctant to share more details.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/baseball-mlb-announces-gambling-safeguards","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00Z","title":"MLB Announces New Gambling Safeguards After Guardians Pitchers Indicted in Betting Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Major League Baseball has responded to a federal indictment of two Cleveland Guardians pitchers, Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, by introducing strict new gambling safeguards.

Jean Carroll \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Monday asked the US Supreme Court to review the $5 million civil case that found he sexually abused and defamed magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a federal appeals court affirmed the jury’s  verdict and $5 million judgment  against Trump, ruling the trial judge did not make errors that would warrant a new trial. In June, Trump  lost an effort   to have the appeal reviewed by the full bench of judges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the civil trial, made numerous errors by allowing the jury to hear testimony from two women who alleged Trump sexually assaulted them years ago.\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers also said the judge should not have let the jurors see the  “Access Hollywood tape, ” which captured Trump in 2005 on a hot mic saying he gropes and kisses women.\n \n\n   \n  Carroll sued Trump alleging he sexually assaulted her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s and defamed her when in 2019 he denied the assault, said she wasn’t his type, and claimed she made it up to boost sales of a book.\n \n\n   \n  “There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation,” Trump told the Supreme Court in the appeal filed Monday viewed by CNN. “Instead, Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th president, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal has not yet been formally docketed at the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Supreme Court takes up the case is yet to be seen, but it likely won’t be the last time the justices are asked to review litigation involving Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  A different jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll for repeating his statements in 2022 and ordered him to pay $83 million in damages. A federal appeals court panel  affirmed the damages award  finding it “reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts” and rejected several of Trump’s legal challenges. Among them, the appeals court found that Trump had previously waived any claim of presidential immunity and said the Supreme Court’s decision last year involving criminal cases did not alter their view.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has asked for the full bench of judges to review the case. The Justice Department filed an amicus brief supporting review of whether presidential immunity can be waived “from civil damages liability predicated on official acts.”  Carroll’s response is due in the next few weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/west-virginia-national-guard-dc-deployment-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00Z","title":"Judge Allows Continued Deployment of West Virginia National Guard in Washington, D.C.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal judge, Richard D.

Lindsay made the ruling after hearing arguments in a lawsuit by a civic organization that argued Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority when he authorized the Guard’s deployment in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The question before this court is whether or not state law allows West Virginia to do this,” Lindsay said. “The court has found that.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge added: “This court believes that the federal law allows for the request made by the president to the governor.”\n \n\n   \n   West Virginia is among several states  that sent National Guard members to the nation’s capital. While the state National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November, it is consulting with the governor’s office and others on the possibility of extending the stay.\n \n\n   \n  Formal orders were issued last week  extending the deployment  of the District of Columbia’s National Guard in the city through the end of February.\n \n\n   \n  “We are pleased with the judge’s decision,” Jace Goins, the state’s chief deputy attorney general, said outside the court in Charleston. “The National Guard are going nowhere. They’re staying in D.C. They’re not going to be redeployed to West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “The judge made the determination that the governor made a lawful decision deploying the National Guard to D.C. by a lawful request of the president.”\n \n\n   \n  The West Virginia Citizen Action Group, which filed the lawsuit, argued that under state law the governor could deploy the National Guard out of state only for certain purposes, such as responding to a natural disaster or another state’s emergency request.\n \n\n   \n  The civic group claimed that it was harmed by the deployment by being forced to refocus its resources away from government accountability and transparency. The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a simple issue of a broad, lawful request by the president and a lawful deployment by the governor. That’s all,” Goins said.\n \n\n   \n  Aubrey Sparks, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s West Virginia chapter, said she didn’t believe it was the correct decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that West Virginia law is clear,” Sparks said. “I think what the state was permitted to do here is to skirt past West Virginia law simply because Trump asked them to. And that’s not how the law works. We remain deeply concerned about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, although the Department of Justice itself says violent crime there is at  a 30-year low .\n \n\n   \n  Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops  from eight states  and the District of Columbia were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist them.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a federal judge heard arguments Oct. 24 on District of Columbia Attorney General  Brian Schwalb  ’s request for an order that would remove National Guard members from Washington streets.

to Oil Ministry spokesman Abdul Sahib Bazoun al-Hasnawi.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil has a 75% stake in the giant West Qurna-2 field in southern Iraq, which produces more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil a

Cañizares, Rocío Muñoz-Ledo, Michael Rios, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:15 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two clashes between rival gangs in a southern Ecuadorian prison left at least 31 inmates dead on Sunday, including 27 who were killed by “asphyxiation,” officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In the first attack, the criminal group  Los Lobos  was targeted by a breakaway gang known as Sao-Box in the early morning, Interior Minister John Reimberg said Monday in an interview with Radio Centro Ecuador. At least four inmates in the Machala Detention Center were reported killed and roughly 36 were wounded. Two officers suffered nonserious injuries as authorities stepped in to regain control of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, Los Lobos carried out a “reprisal” attack against Sao-Box, killing 27 of its members by asphyxiating them inside several cells that both groups shared, according to Reimberg.\n \n\n   \n  “In retaliation, Lobos asphyxiated members of the other organization to avoid leaving signs of violence on their bodies,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Prison guards discovered the bodies around 6 p.m. while carrying out routine inspections.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s penitentiary system SNAI said in a previous statement Sunday that the inmates had “committed asphyxiation among themselves, which resulted in immediate death by suspension.” Authorities did not immediately clarify what they meant by “asphyxiation” or say whether the inmates were hanged.\n \n\n   \n  In response to inquiries from the press, including CNN, SNAI said Sunday that “authorities, operational teams and forensic medical personnel continue working at the scene, verifying information and attending to reported emergencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked why rival gang members shared cells, Reimberg noted that they were initially part of the same group, before Sao-Box broke off from Los Lobos over management disputes. He did not specify why they were still kept in the same place after the split.\n \n\n   \n  The first attack on Sunday was prompted by the transfer of inmates to a new maximum-security facility, SNAI said without providing details.\n \n\n   \n  Reimberg suggested that inmates across the country have been causing chaos to prevent authorities from transferring them to the new prison.\n \n\n   \n  The attacks in Machala are the latest in a series of deadly prison clashes throughout Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  In September, a confrontation between rival gangs at a prison in the coastal city of Esmeraldas left at least  17 dead , according to the National Police. Three days earlier, an additional 14 inmates were killed in Machala.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2021, more than 500 inmates have died in Ecuador’s prisons, according to official figures.\n \n\n   \n  The wave of prison violence is happening despite the deployment of military and police forces in several penitentiaries. It’s part of an ongoing state of internal armed conflict that the government declared in January 2024 to try to quell criminal violence nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  Los Lobos is one of two Ecuadorian criminal groups that the United States said it would designate as foreign terrorist organizations in September. The designation allows the US to impose sanctions and share intelligence with Ecuador “that can be actioned for potentially lethal operations,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/dhs-ice-immigrants-chicago-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"DHS says agents were shot at amid chaotic day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal immigration enforcement operation in Chicago known as 'Operation Midway Blitz,' Border Patrol agents were shot at in the Little Village neighborhood by a male driving a black Jeep, leading to the arrest of a suspect from Mexico.

day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area \n       \n  By Zoe Sottile, Sarah Dewberry, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling Friday  limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Friday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/football-nfl-new-york-giants-fire-brian-daboll","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:05:00-05:00","title":"New York Giants fire head coach Brian Daboll","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The New York Giants fired head coach Brian Daboll following a 24-20 loss to the Chicago Bears, marking the end of a 20-40-1 regular season record.

deal \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:48 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longest shutdown in American history appears headed for a conclusion, after  eight moderate-leaning members  of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to  cut a deal with Republicans  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n   Much has yet to play out  and votes still need to be held. But it looks as though enough Democrats have given up on demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits and have accepted much more modest concessions.\n \n\n   \n  So how did this happen? What did we learn? And where do we go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Here are some takeaways from the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n    1. Democrats caved, full stop\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic Party isn’t leaving this process with nothing. They got a couple of significant concessions.\n \n\n   \n  One is a commitment to hold a Senate vote on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies by next month — a vote that could apply real political pressure on Republicans. Democrats also got Republicans to agree to undo President Donald Trump’s attempts to lay off thousands of federal workers and to block any other such efforts through January.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s no question Democrats are the ones who folded, and somewhat curiously so.\n \n\n   \n  Virtually every poll showed them winning the blame game. They were fighting for something — an extension of the subsides — that those polls showed more than 7 in 10 Americans wanted. About  half of Americans wanted Democrats  to hold the line — something we just haven’t seen in recent shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats could seemingly have drawn this out and forced the issue. But they didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on [the Obamacare tax credits] becoming any more likely?” said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and who voted to advance the deal. “It appears not.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s certainly disputable. What’s not disputable is that a handful of more moderate Democrats lost their nerve.\n \n\n   \n    2. Democrats face a new reckoning — at a really bad time\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps King and Democrats like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  who threw in the towel  were right. Perhaps Democrats never would have won their main concession, and the shutdown would’ve gotten much uglier for the country in the days and weeks ahead — and unnecessarily so.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps worsening travel delays and Americans going hungry amid the legal fight over food stamps would ultimately have cost Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll likely never know.\n \n\n   \n  But what’s clear is that this cave came at a bad time for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It was finally looking like the party had some unity, purpose and wind at their backs after a year of being riven and lost in the wilderness. Some polling suggested Democratic voters, whose dim views of their party rendered it more unpopular than it’s been in decades, were  warming to their party’s brand again . The election results last week, following millions of people turning out to protest Trump at  “No Kings” demonstrations  last month, were especially encouraging for the party.\n \n\n   \n  But now Democrats will endure recriminations over whether the party truly has the stomach to fight Trumpism. The lawmakers who’ve advanced this deal appear to be in for some real vitriol from the base, and it’s likely to renew efforts to cast aside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in some ways seem to be in a similar position to where the GOP was last decade, when a large portion of the party wanted to fight harder, but the more moderate and institutional ranks ultimately stood in the way of a bolder approach.\n \n\n   \n  None of which means this will sink Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. History suggests this shutdown will be a distant memory by then. Anybody who cares that much about the shutdown is probably a nailed-on Democratic voter anyway. And this issue could eventually redound to their benefit (for reasons we’ll get to).\n \n\n   \n  But it does complicate things internally right now.\n \n\n   \n    3. Trump’s hostage-taking worked\n \n\n   \n  One of the more frustrating aspects for the Democratic base will be how this ended.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just that Democrats decided to give in; it’s that they did so in a way that appeared to reward Trump for heavy-handed tactics — again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has in recent days ratcheted up the pressure points. It has fought in court to  avoid paying full SNAP benefits . And it has  reduced traffic at dozens of major airports , leading to  hundreds of canceled flights . (The administration said this move was about safety, but critics wagered it was  more about leverage .) Trump has also pushed the GOP to scrap the filibuster in ways that didn’t seem likely to go anywhere but might have concerned more institutionally minded Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes after Trump explicitly targeted what he called “Democrat programs” with layoffs and funding cuts.\n \n\n   \n  This is a familiar tale by now. Trump has proved plenty willing to reach for all available leverage at his disposal, often violating political norms and possibly even the law in the process.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s worked for him. Institutions including colleges, law firms and media companies have repeatedly folded rather than fight Trump on these things, even when it appeared they had the upper hand. And that surely emboldens him.\n \n\n   \n  “Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” King said Monday morning on MSNBC, “it actually gave him more power.”\n \n\n   \n  Expect plenty of Democrats to pull their hair out over that quote.\n \n\n   \n    4. Trump’s hubris was on full display\n \n\n   \n  The flip side of Trump’s approach, though, was that it betrayed some remarkable hubris.\n \n\n   \n  Just consider all that happened over the last six weeks — and how little care he took to mind the optics.\n \n\n   \n  The administration repeatedly fought to avoid paying full SNAP benefits. That provided lawmaking leverage, yes, but it also risked making it look like it  wanted  to use poor people and their hunger as leverage. The president attended  a “Great Gatsby”-themed party  at his Mar-a-Lago resort the night before Americans were due to start losing those SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House to build a $350 million ballroom that polls show the American people  are pretty skeptical of .\n \n\n   \n  He extensively promoted a  very marbled renovation  of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s efforts to gild the White House seemed to  continue apace .\n \n\n   \n  These are all pretty questionable moves, given not just the shutdown but also a series of troubling economic signs. But Trump, who’s taken to talking about  “affordability”  of late, seems unperturbed by how it might look.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, his approval rating has  plumbed new depths   over the past two weeks .\n \n\n   \n    5. Republicans still have an Obamacare problem — and this could exacerbate it\n \n\n   \n  The best case for Democrats’ strategy is this: They were never going to get Trump and GOP leaders to commit to extending the Obamacare tax credits as part of a shutdown deal. But they could force an issue that’s a significant GOP liability, cast a spotlight on it and even force Republicans to take some tough votes and squirm a little.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of whether that was actually the best Democrats could do, the pressure being applied on the GOP on health care isn’t insignificant.\n \n\n   \n  With around three-quarters of Americans supporting the tax credits, this issue poses very real political problems for Republicans. A recent Pew Research Center poll also showed  health care was the GOP’s worst issue  among a dozen tested, with 42% favoring the Democratic Party’s approach, compared with just 29% for Republicans’.\n \n\n   \n  Look at none other than  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia pleading with her party to renew these tax credits. Or the July  memo authored by Trump’s own pollster , Tony Fabrizio, making the case that letting the subsidies lapse could spell political disaster for the GOP in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, this record-long shutdown could spotlight the choice Republicans are about to make. By voting for a deal that does not extend the subsidies and therefore allows premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans, Republicans will have made it clearer that this is what they fought hard for. They’ll be put on the record on the issue in an even starker way when the Senate takes a separate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  If that measure were somehow to pass, it could pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to allow a vote in the House too.\n \n\n   \n  (Johnson did not take questions at a news conference Monday morning, but he has previously declined to promise such a vote, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has pledged.)\n \n\n   \n  While Democrats want these tax credits extended from a policy standpoint, you could argue that the best thing for them from a raw-politics standpoint is for Republicans to reject them — and for voters to remember it come 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are already having to deal with explaining the  major Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big agenda bill  over the summer. And unlike those cuts, which are delayed until after the 2026 midterms, these premium increases will go into effect quickly.\n \n\n   \n  At the very least, Democrats have continued to fertilize a potent political argument on bad issue for the GOP.\n \n\n   \n    6. Maybe shutdowns can actually work?\n \n\n   \n  Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell often says shutdowns simply don’t work. He said in 2023 that they “never have produced a policy change and they’ve always been a loser for Republicans, politically.”\n \n\n   \n  This shutdown should challenge that conventional wisdom.\n \n\n   \n  No, Democrats didn’t get all or even most of what they wanted. But their ability to largely win the blame game suggests future shutdowns could be successfully leveraged, if the party forcing them plays its cards right.\n \n\n   \n  The big problem with the GOP’s shutdown strategies last decade seemed to be that the things they were shutting the government down over — defunding Obamacare and building a border wall — just weren’t that popular.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats showed that if you push for something that enough people favor, you might have a shot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/visa-mastercard-deal-merchant-fees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:47:00-05:00","title":"Visa and Mastercard Might Have a Deal to Lower Merchant Fees.

In 2024,  over a third  of all purchases were made with credit cards and those who use them might face new surcharges when they swipe or have to use another form of payment if businesses don’t accept their card.\n \n\n   \n  And because credit card companies finance credit card rewards, lower interchange fees may mean fewer perks. “If you were to lower interchange fees, you probably have to also lower rewards,” Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston told CNN last month. That’s because “rewards are financed by interchange fees.”\n \n\n   \n  The two credit card giants have been entangled in a lawsuit brought by retailers for the last 20 years that alleged the companies have fixed the price of interchange fees — a large portion of the fees merchants pay when a customer makes a purchase with a credit card.

Brodie  rejected  the $30 billion proposal.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal announced this morning would see the two companies bring down interchange fees by 0.1% over the next five years, give merchants the choice to add surcharges when customers pay with credit cards as well as the option to refuse premium cards, which often charge substantially  higher fees .\n \n\n   \n  “After more than 20 years of litigation, Visa and Mastercard have reached a proposed settlement with U.S. merchants of all sizes that would provide meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how they accept payments from their customers,” Visa told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mastercard said that “smaller merchants will gain in this settlement – more acceptance choices, reduced costs and simplified rules.”\n \n\n   \n  The proposal from Visa and Mastercard specifically states that the deal is not an admission of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The National Retail Federation, a powerful trade group representing retailers, called the proposal “ window dressing .” A press release issued in response to reports of the proposal said the reduction in interchange fees doesn’t go far enough to address the rise in interchange fees, which they say average around 2.35%.\n \n\n   \n  The European Union capped credit card interchange fees at 0.3% in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that they believe the proposal from Visa and Mastercard, which has accumulated widespread opposition from retailers, is unlikely to be enacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s remarkable that anyone could think a temporary 10 basis point reduction — barely more than last year’s increase — is fair compensation for allowing a credit card duopoly to maintain their pricing cartel for eight more years,” said the National Restaurant Federation.\n \n\n   \n  “If the courts can’t fix this, it’s time for Congress to take action,” said the National Retail Federation’s General Counsel Stephanie Martz.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/media/bbc-trump-edit-lawsuit-turness-davie-media","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Trump threatens to sue BBC as broadcaster faces ‘fight for its survival’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is facing a major political and public relations crisis following a misleading edit in a 2024 documentary about Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC is embroiled in a massive political fight over its future, with conservatives capitalizing on  an editing screw-up  and denouncing the British broadcaster while liberals argue that the institution is flawed but worth defending.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump intensified the pressure by sending a threatening legal letter to the news organization over the misleading edit in a one-year-old documentary about his reelection campaign. He is demanding at least $1 billion in damages.\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson told CNN that “we will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has sent several legal letters to other news organizations, including CNN, during his second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s legal threats often don’t amount to anything, but he does have pending lawsuits against the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Des Moines Register.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah issued a belated apology for the “error of judgment” with the October 2024 documentary. BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness tendered their resignations on Sunday as stories about the edit scandal consumed British media.\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the misleading edit was politically motivated. Nor is there any reason to believe that Davie and Turness knew about it ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  However, a lawyer for Trump asserted Monday that the BBC defamed the president “by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, charges the broadcaster with defamation and claims that Trump has suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” despite no one seeming to call out the error at the time of the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, The Telegraph, a longtime source of anti-BBC commentary, wrote about an “internal report” revealing the bad edit, and the story has since snowballed.\n \n\n   \n  The pre-election film spliced together different parts of Trump’s infamous January 6 speech at the Ellipse to make it sound like Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  In a contrite letter to the head of a parliamentary committee on Monday, Shah said the BBC accepted that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We are not perfect’\n \n\n   \n  The revelation about the misleading edit has contributed to an ongoing political fight over the BBC’s funding and future, with conservatives using the error as a new opportunity to denounce the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack,” BBC veteran John Simpson wrote on X Sunday night. He praised Davie and Turness and said, “We’ve now got a real fight on our hands to defend public service broadcasting, because that’s under threat too.”\n \n\n   \n  This is ultimately all about trust: Who trusts the BBC, who doesn’t, and why.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s adversaries, including politicians who detest its news coverage and media moguls who want to take its market share, say the BBC has lost trust, perhaps permanently.\n \n\n   \n  They cite a wide range of perceived wrongs. Former conservative party leader Liz Truss, who had a brief term as prime minister in 2022, wrote on Sunday, “I’m glad the US President and the rest of the world are seeing the BBC for what it is. failure to tell the truth on everything from transgender ideology to economics to Gaza has done huge damage to politics and government in this country. This should be the end of nationalised broadcasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Conservative activists in the UK have long railed against the license fee that British households pay for BBC programs and services. The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, including the license fee structure, ahead of the current charter’s expiration at the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That review presents an opening for the BBC’s many critics to demand changes — at the same time, the BBC is trying to establish new revenue streams and transform itself for the digital age.\n \n\n   \n  Last week’s story in The Telegraph was based on a lengthy memo by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines. Prescott’s memo warned the BBC board about what he called serious problems with news coverage and “inaction” by the broadcaster’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary was his first example, but he also cited concerns about coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, gender identity, racial diversity and other matters. He argued that “errors are repeated time and time again.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah responded on Monday and said the BBC has “published corrections where we have got things wrong; changed editorial guidance to make the BBC’s position on issues clearer; made changes to leadership where the problems point to underlying issues; and carried out formal disciplinary measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah also urged people to keep “a sense of perspective,” pointing to “thousands of hours of outstanding journalism” by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  But a sense of perspective is usually the first thing lost in a media feeding frenzy. Veteran British journalist Alan Rusbridger wrote Monday that the BBC now finds itself “in a fight for its survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary error was “serious,” Rusbridger wrote, but the BBC’s enemies want to see the entire organization “wither or die,” which “would leave us all far worse off.”\n \n\n   \n  Robert Shrimsley, UK chief political commentator and executive editor of the Financial Times, said on X that it’s important to recognize the political dimensions of the dispute.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that the BBC has made serious culpable errors does not negate the point that there is a real and concerted right-wing media campaign to destroy it,” Shrimsley said. “Both points can be true at the same time and the campaign would not end even if the errors did.”\n \n\n   \n  After reading all the press about the scandal from Kyiv, where he is on assignment, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale took to social media and expressed his pride in the organization.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not perfect; we must always strive to be better,” he wrote Monday. “But in a darkening world, we remain a shaft of light.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00Z","title":"Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has officially lost its measles elimination status after sustained transmission of the measles virus was confirmed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) following a review by its Re-Verification Commission (RVC).

Public Health Agency of Canada said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Canada’s health agency was informed by the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, that it had lost its measles elimination status as viral transmission has continued uninterrupted since October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Although it has slowed recently, according to the Canadian government, the outbreak is still ongoing, primarily within undervaccinated communities.\n \n\n   \n  “PAHO’s Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission reviewed recent epidemiological and laboratory data, confirming sustained transmission of the same measles virus strain in Canada for a period of more than one year,” officials said in a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The Re-Verification Commission, or RVC, is an independent body of experts created by the Pan American Health Organization to analyze data and the current measles outbreak situation. The group met at the beginning of November and made its recommendations to the PAHO director, who makes the ultimate decision about Canada’s status.\n \n\n   \n  Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the virus strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months, the Public Health Agency of Canada  said on its website.  The agency said it is working with PAHO and local public health leaders to slow the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Canada  had been considered measles-free since 1998.  A measles vaccine was first approved to be used in Canada in 1963, and various vaccination campaigns were successful. But in more recent years, vaccine hesitancy has grown, and vaccination rates fell below the target of 95% coverage for all recommended childhood vaccines,  research shows .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said Monday. “This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible.”\n \n\n   \n  However, with the change in Canada’s status, the Americas region officially loses its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  There are no formal consequences to losing such status. But until measles is eliminated worldwide, countries will face the risk of reintroduction and the spread of the virus, Barbosa said. The virus is so contagious that one infected person can transmit the disease to up to 18 others.\n \n\n   \n  As of last month, Canada had tallied more than 5,000 cases for the year — more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined.\n \n\n   \n  The US has also seen large outbreaks this year and is on the verge of losing its elimination status.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that the US is going to stop the transmission even before that deadline,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, executive manager of PAHO’s Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s large US measles outbreak started in West Texas in January. It’s been declared over, but there is an investigation into whether a growing outbreak along the Arizona-Utah state line could be connected. Cases and outbreaks have also been reported in other states.\n \n\n   \n  “We are supporting all the actions that the US has been taking to actually control the outbreak to stop them,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico also has a recent outbreak, Salas said, concentrated mostly in Chihuahua, but there are also cases in Mexico’s southern states.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely, they need to continue vaccinating,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  With hard work, Barbosa said, he believes that Canada can regain its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have demonstrated before with political commitment regional cooperation and sustain the vaccination, the region can once again interrupt the transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:26:00Z","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the United States face a significantly higher risk of homicide, especially from firearms, with more than two-thirds of pregnancy-related homicides involving guns.

Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life. It will never be the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Black box safety warning to be removed from hormone therapy for menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is removing the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause, which was first introduced in 2003 based on the Women’s Health Initiative study.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a pivotal move, the US Food and Drug Administration said Monday that  it is taking steps to remove the lengthy “black box” warning  on many hormone treatments for women with menopause symptoms, a shift expected to give women more options for treatment and generate a flood of new prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  Hormone therapy has long been on the market, but prescriptions plummeted after 2003, when the warning described increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, breast cancer and dementia.\n \n\n   \n  “After 23 years of dogma, the FDA today is announcing that we are going to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in announcing the change.\n \n\n   \n  Prescribing requires nuance, FDA officials said, especially around when women start hormone therapy. Some women still face some risks from hormone therapy, including those at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n  But for many women, the benefits may far outweigh the risks.\n \n\n   \n  “With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there’s no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary  posted on X  Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  It could take months for the labels to change, but drugmakers are “very excited” to make the update, Makary said.  Label changes  will include updated guidance that hormones should be initiated in women who are younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause to optimize benefits and risks, and removal of guidance to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time — clearing the way for women to stay on the treatments for years.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors, and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s health experts praised the move to update the boxed warning to reflect newer scientific evidence around menopausal hormone therapy but said individualized discussions of risks and benefits will still be needed.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a past president of the Menopause Society, said the labeling change was overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “As a bottom line, I think given more than 20 years of class-wide labeling of hormone therapy, it is time to get the labeling right, and some of these changes that are proposed are very well-supported. Others may be controversial, but overall, it is a step in the right direction,” said Manson, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study that spurred the initial label change.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, this box warning is a one-size-fits-all summary that hormone therapy increases the risk of all these conditions,” Manson said. “It doesn’t take into account whether it’s local estrogen or systemic estrogen, the age of the woman, the type of the formulation.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said she is among many doctors who advocated for label changes for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Removing the scary boxed warning from local vaginal estrogen is a victory for women’s health and for those who care for and about menopausal women,” Pinkerton said in a statement. “Regarding the removal of the boxed warning for systemic hormone therapy, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and has systemic effects throughout the body, we appreciate the FDA’s thoughtful, nuanced approach. Discussions will be more complicated and need to be individualized, as different menopause therapies differ in potential risks.”\n \n\n   \n    What changed around hormone therapy\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of  menopause treatments  that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after  a large government-funded study , the Women’s Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.\n \n\n   \n  After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them, and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25,  one study found .\n \n\n   \n  The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “ Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You ” and “ The New Hormone Solution .”\n \n\n   \n  “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don’t need hormone replacement; you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.\n \n\n   \n  “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”\n \n\n   \n  More recent analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative,  as early as 2010 , have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn’t be taking hormones, because they’re going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”\n \n\n   \n  In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Makary  told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta  in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really a tragedy. It’s maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”\n \n\n   \n    Changing views on menopause\n \n\n   \n  The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance   coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.\n \n\n   \n  “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it’s not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Center at the  New York University School of Law , who has been tracking menopause legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “All these things are happening at the same time, and that’s in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User’s Manual and Citizens Guide.”\n \n\n   \n  The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started  a petition to the FDA  to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”\n \n\n   \n  The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women’s health and cardiovascular research.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact of the matter is, estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it’s like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it’s just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Women live about  six years longer  than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That’s where hormone therapy can help.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/nicolas-sarkozy-released-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-05:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Released from Prison Pending Appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from prison pending appeal after a Paris court ruled he could be freed under judicial control, following a September 2025 conviction for allegedly financing his 2007 presidential campaign with Libyan funds in exchange for diplomatic favors.

Giuliani, others involved in efforts to overturn 2020 election \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, Michael Williams, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:57 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has pardoned a long list of his political allies for their support or involvement in plans to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to the Department of Justice’s Pardon Attorney, Ed Martin.\n \n\n   \n  The individuals listed in a proclamation, which Martin  posted on X  late Sunday, include high-profile figures like former   Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, among dozens of others.\n \n\n   \n  “This proclamation ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation,” read the document, which gives the date of November 7 in its text and the president appears to have signed.\n \n\n   \n  It includes a “full, complete, and unconditional pardon” for those named, including some of the president’s co-defendants who were charged in Georgia for trying to  subvert Trump’s 2020 election defeat .\n \n\n   \n  The pardons mark the latest step Trump has taken to absolve or protect his allies who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. One of his first official acts in his second term was to pardon over 1,000 people who were charged or convicted in the January 6 ​attack.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential pardons only apply to federal charges, not state or local charges. None of the people on the list are currently charged with federal crimes, though some were named as unindicted co-conspirators in special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump, which prosecutors withdrew after Trump’s 2024 election victory.\n \n\n   \n  However, state-level criminal charges are still pending against Giuliani, Meadows, many of the 2020 fake electors, and others on the pardon list. (They deny wrongdoing.) These 2020-related state prosecutions are ongoing in Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. These figures will likely try to use the pardon to aid their defense, though a presidential pardon doesn’t cover state crimes.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon also explicitly states that it does not apply to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon covers Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official in 2020 who  tried to weaponize   the department’s powers to overturn the election. (Clark is now a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.) Like Giuliani and Powell, Clark was an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal 2020-related indictment against Trump,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Clark said in  an X post  Monday that Trump had called him on Friday to inform him about the pardon. He said that he never asked for a pardon, defended his actions in 2020, and thanked Trump. But he also acknowledged the limits of clemency action.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good — a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others,” Clark wrote. “Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell and Giuliani, both of whom served as Trump’s personal lawyers, were at the center of the sprawling conspiracy theories which baselessly claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Giuliani  played a leading role  in the “fake electors” scheme which sought to block then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking office by presenting certificates from battleground states which falsely said Trump won the election, during the Congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said in a statement that the former New York City mayor “stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election,” adding that he “never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump’s decision.”\n \n\n   \n  Two of the architects of the fake electors scheme — lawyers  Ken Chesebro  and John Eastman — were also pardoned. Chesebro previously pleaded guilty in the Georgia election racketeering indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Also pardoned were Jenna Ellis, Trump’s 2020 campaign lawyer, and former Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, Michael Ward.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis had been accused of working to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud. She  pleaded guilty  in the Georgia case and struck a cooperation deal that led to her Arizona charges  being dropped . The Wards were accused of acting as fake electors in Arizona. Also pardoned was Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign lawyer who prosecutors alleged  helped organized  the scheme and later served as one of Trump’s personal lawyer during his New York criminal trial in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the people Trump pardoned as “great Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  “These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,” Leavitt said. “Getting prosecuted for challenging results is something that happens in communist Venezuela, not the United States of America, and President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime’s communist tactics once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Martin’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Also last week, the president  granted clemency  to a retired New York City police officer who was convicted in 2023 for stalking a New Jersey family on behalf of the Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also pardoned former Major League Baseball star  Darryl Strawberry  for a 1995 tax evasion charge.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/rastafarian-landor-dreadlocks-supreme-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Leans Against Rastafarian Man Seeking to Sue Prison Officials for Cutting His Dreadlocks","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Damon Landor, a Rastafarian inmate, sued prison officials in Louisiana for forcibly cutting his dreadlocks, which he had grown in accordance with a religious vow.

\nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court appeared unconvinced Monday that a  devout Rastafarian whose dreadlocks  were forcibly cut in prison five years ago should be able to sue correction officials for damages.\n \n\n   \n  Damon Landor had a few weeks left in his sentence for drug possession when guards at a Louisiana prison handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off the knee-length dreadlocks he had grown over nearly two decades. Minutes earlier, Landor had handed them a judicial opinion requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for religious purposes.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, the case appeared tailor-made for a conservative Supreme Court that has consistently sided with religious interests in recent years. But over the course of nearly two hours of argument, it became clear that the conservative wing is far more concerned with allowing people to sue individual state officials as a way to  enforce federal spending laws .\n \n\n   \n  That’s largely because, several justices suggested, those individual state employees were not likely aware of the agreements states had made in exchange for federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, the facts of this case are egregious,” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing. But, she said, “we can’t decide a case just based on these facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative who is among the court’s most ardent supporters of religious rights, suggested that under Landor’s theory, a cisgender woman trying out for a sports team on a college campus that receives federal funding could sue a coach personally for $1 million in damages for allowing a transgender woman onto that team.\n \n\n   \n  It was a notable question in part because the court is expected in coming weeks to hear arguments on whether states may ban transgender athletes from competing on teams consistent with their gender identity.\n \n\n   \n  “As I understand it,” Gorsuch said, the federal appeals courts “are unanimously against you and have been for many, many, many years.”\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He was incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana countered that RLUIPA is effectively a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials. The individual officials involved in Landor’s forced shaving were not a party to that contract, Louisiana said, so they can’t be held personally liable.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts said Landor’s argument that state employees had received notice rested on a “legal fiction.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think when the prison guard is hired, he says, ‘well, I want to see the federal conditions that you agreed to under the contract,’” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s three-justice liberal wing saved most of its toughest questions for Louisiana’s attorney.\n \n\n   \n  The court is likely to hand down a decision in the case next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5605538","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00-05:00","title":"Why flight disruptions could linger even after the government shutdown ends","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite the government shutdown ending, flight disruptions are expected to persist due to severe staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, many of whom are working without pay or have taken second jobs.

      \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — Flight disruptions are likely to continue even after the  government reopens , airlines and aviation regulators warned, as airlines cancelled scores of flights on Tuesday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to reduce air traffic at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, with  cuts still ramping up  to 10% of flights by Friday. The agency has been dealing with persistent staffing  shortages of air traffic controllers , who are required to work without pay during the shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history at 42 days and counting. This past weekend, the FAA reported staffing shortages at dozens of facilities, prompting the agency to slow air traffic to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who did show up to work. On Tuesday, airlines canceled more than 1,200 flights, according to the  aviation tracking site FlightAware . The situation seemed to be improving somewhat on Tuesday, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, with only a handful of FAA facilities reporting staffing shortages. But Duffy said that air traffic restrictions would remain in place until regulators are satisfied that staffing is back to normal levels. \"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions in travel,\" Duffy said during a press conference at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. \"But it depends on controllers coming back to work.\" Even when those restrictions are lifted, it may take several days for airlines to return to normal operations. \"It's gonna take a bit to unwind,\" said former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt  in an interview  with NPR's  All Things Considered . \"The airplanes are in the wrong cities and so forth. They're going to have to sort all that out as well. So a good deal of the responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying,\" Babbitt said. An aviation industry trade group, Airlines for America, also warned that it will take time for carriers to get back to normal. \"Airlines' reduced flight schedules cannot immediately bounce back to full capacity right after the government reopens. It will take time, and there will be residual effects for days,\" the group said in a statement. The FAA argues the flight restrictions are necessary to keep the system safe while fewer air traffic controllers are showing up to work during the government shutdown. Some of those controllers have taken on second jobs during the shutdown, and many have called in sick. But to the Trump administration's critics, the move appears to be about more than just safety. Some Democrats argue that the cuts were a political ploy to raise the pressure to end the government shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Secretary Duffy rejected that charge on Tuesday, saying the administration was responding to real concerns from pilots and mounting concerns about increasing loss of separation between aircraft.

and British delicacies: How an appetite for originality transformed celebrity interviews \n       \n  By Yahya Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:24 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Woody Harrelson, the acclaimed actor known for his mellow and jovial energy, was breaking down, barely able to string together coherent sentences because his mouth was on fire from the ludicrously spicy hot sauce that coated his fried cauliflower. Of course, the pain is what you order by coming on Hot Ones, the beloved hot wings YouTube show.\n \n\n   \n  Once it was over, Harrelson still coughing, admitted to  host Sean Evans , “You nearly killed me, dude … and I say that with all due respect, because I know you nearly kill people on the daily.”\n \n\n   \n  Harrelson said that he never thought he’d do the show because he used to think he didn’t have what it took to get to the end of the  poultry gauntlet . “And now, here we are,” he said, victorious.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, while proclaimed in jest, captures a current appetite among many celebrities and fans alike to break away from conventional interviews in favor of more authentic and flavorful content.\n \n\n   \n  And what else like breaking bread – or chicken wings or, you know,  yeast extract  – has the ability to break that artifice, foster trust and entice celebrities to lower their guards for a playful exchange to which audiences can relate.\n \n\n   \n  “The hardest part of the interview is penetrating all of that artifice to get something real,” Evans told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  Ollie Kendal, one-half of the food content creator duo, JOLLY, put it even more succinctly in a separate conversation with CNN: “It’s the language everyone speaks: Food…Everyone’s got to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  And trust that people eat up the chance to see Gordon Ramsey serenade Evans with his trademark colorful language while chugging bubblegum-pink stomach soother on what has become Hot Ones’ most watched episode, or John Cena stoically brave the potent musk of British Black pudding (blood sausage) with JOLLY as he declares it a sign of sophistication.\n \n\n   \n  Hot Ones, JOLLY and Amelia Dimoldenberg’s  Chicken Shop Date  – with billions of combined total views and tens of millions of subscribers – are some of the most visible examples of the genre’s popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Many descendants have followed, including traditional media companies that are still trying to find new spins on the concept. (See: The NYT’s launch of “The Pizza Interview,” which asks press-touring celebrities to toss some dough while trying not to get their likely borrowed outfits covered in sauce.)\n \n\n   \n  In what is arguably the boom of the feed-the-famous frenzy, a natural question has emerged: Is it reaching the point of being bloated or is there more to feast on?\n \n\n   \n    Spicing up the press tour\n \n\n   \n  Food’s place within entertainment has never been a gimmick. In fact, it’s an interviewing tradition that dates back decades and has taken many forms.\n \n\n   \n  Jessa Moore, a media specialist with experience in food and tech, points out that culinary hosts like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten have featured celebrities on their shows since the nineties and early aughts. Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97245","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:54:00-05:00","title":"With an upcoming vote in the House, an end to the shutdown is in sight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 41 days of a record-long government shutdown, the U.S. Senate voted 60 to 40 to approve a continuing resolution that would fund most of the government through January 30, 2026, and fully fund the SNAP program through September 30, 2026.

to the shutdown is in sight \n         By Sam Gringlas \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 11:54 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         On the 41st day of a record-long government shutdown, the U.S. Senate voted 60 to 40 to approve a continuing resolution to reopen the government.  The measure  would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September. But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass   the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Trump can sign it into law. House leadership has told members to return to Washington for a vote as early as Wednesday afternoon. Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026. \"This is a great victory for the American people, and it shows that the Senate can work,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me. A deal without Democrats' health care demands But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on election night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., said on the floor before the vote. \"The people I work for need more than that. They need health care that they can afford, not a symbolic vote.\" Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who helped drive the bipartisan negotiations, told reporters Monday that more than eight members of the caucus had initially pledged to support the deal, but some backed out ahead of the vote.  On to the House House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36 hours' notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks. \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either. But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it. Coming health care debate Democrats now need to come up with health care legislation that can get the support of enough Republicans. Some Republicans in the House and Senate  have expressed interest  in preventing the Affordable Care Act premiums from skyrocketing, but many have also talked about the need for reforms like income caps and fraud prevention. A few weeks is not much time for an overhaul, and people are deciding now whether to keep their  insurance plans  next year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If we want to get a bill that has bipartisan support, we've got to address some of those issues,\" Shaheen told reporters on Monday. \"I think the White House is going to engage on this because the president has figured out, and his pollsters have been very clear, it's more of an issue for people in red states than it is in blue states. If he [doesn't], well, shame on him.\"   Speaker Johnson, though, told reporters on Monday that he would not guarantee an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate. The government funding situation is not fully resolved for the year, either. The full-year funding measures passed by the Senate include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Congress still needs to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution runs out again at the end of January.  NPR's Barbara Sprunt and Deirdre Walsh contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598308","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00-20:00","title":"This week brings new books grappling with the endings of relationships and eras","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This week, several new books explore the theme of endings — from the end of romantic relationships to the collapse of historical eras.

11, 2025 • 10:40 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It feels fitting, in a way, that so many notable books this week are premised on endings — of lives, relationships, eras, even. After all, Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day — also known as Veterans Day in the U.S. – is Tuesday. The day annually  marks the end  of one of history's most catastrophic conflicts, World War I. For the most part, the endings that animate many of this week's new novels don't seek such world-historical consequence. Ann Packer, Quiara Alegria Hudes and the other authors who grace the list below are concerned with much more intimate details, the kind you're more likely to encounter just down the street than on a battlefield or at an international summit. That said, the twisty history of currency — the subject of this week's one nonfiction entry in the roundup — reinforces a lesson learned with the peace of 1918: Beware of endings; they have the odd habit of being yet another beginning in disguise. Some Bright Nowhere , by Ann Packer Ann Packer's first novel in a decade finds the American author again pursuing a deceptively simple premise: A long-married couple must prepare for and confront their final weeks together before death comes for one of them. But don't be fooled by the saccharine-sounding summary. As  Fresh Air 's Maureen Corrigan explained in  a review of Packer's previous novel ,  The Children's Crusade , the author has a knack for turning what might have been \"mundane mass-market fiction\" into a rich, splintered narrative that \"illuminate[s] the unexpected depths of the commonplace.\" The White Hot , by Quiara Alegria Hudes It's possible you've already encountered Hudes' writing without knowing it. Though her name is new to the adult fiction shelf, the veteran playwright penned the book for the Tony-winning musical  In the Heights ,  wrote the screenplay  for  its 2021 film adaptation  and won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for  her play  Water by the Spoonful , about the return of an Iraq war veteran. In  The White Hot ,  she explores a departure , in the voice of a young mother who tries to understand and explain her decision to leave her family for the freedom of a one-way ticket far, far away. The Silver Book , by Olivia Laing Laing's writing roams a Venn diagram of memoir, art criticism, history and fiction, rarely pursuing just one genre without including at least some elements of the others. Her memoir  The Lonely City , for instance, wove the stuff of academic journals into a  chronicle of her life in New York City . Her only previous novel,  Crudo , dressed up in the persona of author Kathy Acker for an exercise that NPR's reviewer admiringly called a \"memoir in drag.\" For its part,  The Silver Book , though a novel, sets its inventions in an especially consequential – and controversial – era of Italian cinema: the final year or two before the brutal, unsolved murder of director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Evensong , by Stewart O'Nan O'Nan's latest novel finds the \"oracle of the ordinary and maven of the middle class\" — as NPR reviewer Heller McAlpin  described the novelist in 2012  — once again mining the mundane for its hidden magic. In  Evensong , the cult favorite centers a small, lovingly rendered group of older women as they navigate the peculiar challenges of growing older, together as friends. The History of Money: A Story of Humanity , by David McWilliams McWilliams is an Irish economist,  podcaster  and founder of a festival that  pairs world economics with standup comedy . Promoting the festival back in 2010, McWilliams  explained to NPR  why he orients his work more toward the hoi polloi than the ivory tower: \"If you think that knowledge is power, well, then giving people the knowledge, packaging the knowledge in such a way that the knowledge becomes accessible — that empowers the people.\" That rings true in this lively, lightfooted life story of currency, which cares less for comprehensiveness than keeping the door open for experts and novices alike. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97516","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:46:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Extends Order Blocking Full SNAP Payments, with Shutdown Potentially Near an End","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court extended a temporary order blocking full SNAP payments during a federal government shutdown, with the order set to expire just before midnight on Thursday, November 13, 2025.

The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The order will expire just before midnight Thursday. The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it's not clear how quickly full payments would resume. The justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn't otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments. How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it's easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount. An urgent need for beneficiaries In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year. That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what's left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,\" Malliard said. \"To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.\" The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help. \"I figure that I've spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,\" said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a \"little food pantry\" in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York. SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans. The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments. Congressional talks about reopening government The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans. President Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it \"looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending.\" Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn't be up to the courts. \"The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. \"The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.\" After Tuesday's ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: \"Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.\" The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion. \"The chaos was sown by USDA's delays and intransigence,\" they said, \"not by the district court's efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599118","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:56:00-05:00","title":"U.S. Appeals Order to Use American Sign Language Interpreters at White House Briefings","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Justice is appealing a federal court order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation during press briefings when President Trump or press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks.

In a court filing on Friday responding to U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's ruling, the Justice Department requested clarification on which types of events should have ASL interpretation available. The DOJ said it believes the services should be limited to regularly scheduled briefings and not other events where the president takes questions from the press. It notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the White House's current vendor agreement for ASL interpretative services requires 24 hours' notice. \"In the unlikely event the vendor cannot produce an interpreter to provide simultaneous briefing despite 24 hours' notice, the White House intends to publish the ASL interpretation as soon as practicable,\" the DOJ said in Friday's filing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The department said the White House is working to \"establish a publicly accessible channel showing ASL interpretation that would be provided simultaneously with every press briefing subject to the injunction.\" The DOJ said the judge's order should not apply to remarks made in a broad set of scenarios. \"The White House does not understand 'press briefings' to encompass events with other purposes, such as a ceremony or a speech, at which the President may choose to take questions from the press,\" the department said. Ali  issued the preliminary injunction  on Nov. 4 and ordered the Trump administration to update the court on compliance by last Friday. \"White House press briefings engage the American people on important issues affecting their daily lives — in recent months, war, the economy, and healthcare, and in recent years, a global pandemic,\" Ali wrote in the order. \"The exclusion of deaf Americans from that programming, in addition to likely violating the Rehabilitation Act, is clear and present harm that the court cannot meaningfully remedy after the fact.\" The government's appeal of Ali's order is being filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The White House stopped using live ASL interpreters at briefings and other public events when President Trump began his second term in January. The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two deaf men  filed the lawsuit  against Trump and Leavitt in May. The suit also names White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with the offices for president and vice president. It alleges the White House's failure to provide ASL violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by the federal government. The suit also claims the White House is in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, which protect free speech and provide for due process, respectively. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a new filing on Monday, the NAD told the court the White House has failed to comply with its order and argued the injunction covers all publicly announced press briefings, including those scheduled with less than 24 hours' notice. The group's interim CEO, Bobbie Beth Scoggins, told NPR in a statement last week that the organization is pleased that deaf and hard of hearing Americans will soon regain access to important information from the government. \"American Sign Language and accurate captioning are both essential to ensuring full and equal access to information,\" Scoggins said. \"ASL and English are distinct languages, and captions alone cannot meet the needs of everyone in our community. The court's ruling affirms what we have long known: equal access to information from the White House is not optional. We deserve the same timely, direct access to White House briefings as everyone else.\" Ali's order specifies that the ASL interpretation must be visible and signed by a qualified interpreter. He was not persuaded by White House arguments that it does provide closed captioning. \"The defendants correctly note that the plaintiffs are entitled only to reasonable accommodation. But it is not reasonable — indeed it can hardly be called an accommodation at all — to transcribe press briefings into a language that Ford and many NAD members do not know,\" Ali said in his opinion. Ali is referring to plaintiff Derrick Ford, of Anderson, Ind. According to the NAD, hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people do not know English. ASL has its own vocabulary and grammar that is different from English. The judge stopped short of granting the group's request to require ASL interpretation at briefings and events conducted by the vice president, first lady, and second lady.

Adolf Hitler had killed himself in his bunker in April 1945, but his second-in-command, Hermann Göring, was among the Nuremberg defendants. Before the trials began in November of that year, American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley spent dozens of hours speaking with and evaluating the Nazi officials. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That lesser known story, told in Jack El-Hai's 2013 book  The Nazi and the Psychiatrist , is the inspiration behind a new film. Its theatrical release coincides with the 80th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg trials — the first international criminal trials and a precursor to the International Criminal Court.  At the heart of James Vanderbilt's  Nuremberg  is the complex relationship between Kelley and Göring. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       \"They both wanted to get something out of the other one,\" writer-director Vanderbilt told NPR's  Morning Edition  host Leila Fadel. \"Kelley has the highest ranking living Nazi basically dropped into his lap and sort of goes, this is an opportunity to dissect the nature of evil. Göring, on the other hand, is looking for his last moment on the world stage.\" Ultimately, Kelley is haunted by his own conclusion, as described in his memoir  22 Cells in Nuremberg , that the Nazis were fundamentally no different than the average person and that their atrocities could be replicated anywhere. \"Göring was by all accounts an incredibly charming and funny individual,\" Vanderbilt said. \"The fact that he loves his wife the same way that we love our spouses, that he loves his children [daughter] the same way we love our children, to me that doesn't excuse anything. It actually makes it all the more horrifying.\" The material has some parallels with Vanderbilt's script for the 2007 thriller  Zodiac , where one man becomes obsessed with another's crimes. In  Nuremberg , Russell Crowe leads a stellar cast as Göring — a role for which he learned to speak German — while Rami Malek plays Kelley. Michael Shannon is Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who served as the chief U.S. prosecutor at the trials.  \"Nuremberg was a pretty remarkable moment in history where the world came together to choose justice over vengeance and do something that I think was truly a good act,\" Vanderbilt said. Jackson helped stand up the tribunal in short order, involving British, French, Soviet and U.S. judges. He did so because, as his character puts it in the film, \"the world needs to know what these men did.\" He also hoped to prevent the horrors of World War II from ever taking place again. That last part proves most elusive, as the film hammers home repeatedly, though not very subtly. In Göring's cell, with his superiors pressuring him to find out what the Nazi figurehead might say on the stand, Kelley asks the military commander what drew him to Hitler. Göring's response? \"He made us feel German again.\" Vanderbilt denies he was inspired by President Trump's campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again,\" but the parallels are unlikely to escape audiences. \"I wrote that scene 12 years ago,\" he said. \"I felt it was relevant then, and I certainly feel it's relevant now. And I think, unfortunately, it will be relevant in the future.\" In  another true-to-life subplot , Howie Triest (Leo Woodall) returns to Germany to serve as a U.S. military translator at Nuremberg, after having fled the country for the U.S. because he was a German Jew. He tells Kelley in the film: \"Do you want to know why it happened here? Because people let it happen.\" A pivotal moment in the film comes when  wartime footage  shot as Allied troops reached the concentration camps is shown in the courtroom. The images of emaciated survivors and bodies piled up, dozens of them pushed on top of one another by a bulldozer, have lost none of their shocking horror 80 years later. \"It was something from the very beginning I knew I wanted to do,\" Vanderbilt said. He told his actors to avoid doing any research for the scene in order to perform it fresh. So, on a set built to the exact specifications of the Nuremberg courtroom, with 300 extras and four cameras turned on each of the lead actors, the team observed a moment of silence. Then, they switched on the projector. \"What you see in our movie is the reaction of those actors\" in that moment, Vanderbilt said. \"I wanted to put you as an audience member in the same shoes as the people were in the courtroom that day when this footage was first shown to the world.\" The broadcast version of this story was produced by  Phil Harrell .  \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Nearly eight decades ago, the Nuremberg trials held by the Allied powers revealed the full horror of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime during World War II. The new film \"Nuremberg\" focuses on the Nazis' second in command, Hermann Goering - played by Russell Crowe - and the psychiatrist tasked with monitoring him, Douglas Kelley, played by Rami Malek. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NUREMBERG\") RAMI MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) Goering is, above all things, a narcissist. The only thing he cares about is building Germany up and then becoming her leader. He does not care about the Jews. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) So he's fine with them dying. MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) And he's fine with them not. The only thing Hermann Goering cares about is Hermann Goering. Does that sound like a man who dedicates himself to the extermination of an entire race? FADEL: Much of the tension revolves around how Goering and Kelley try to outsmart each other, leading to a showdown in court. \"Nuremberg\" is directed by James Vanderbilt. JAMES VANDERBILT: Kelley has the highest-ranking living Nazi basically dropped into his lap, and sort of goes, this is an opportunity to dissect the nature of evil. He goes, you know, what made these men able to commit the crimes that they did? What sets them apart from us? Goering, on the other hand, is, you know, looking for his last moment on the world stage. He's looking to define himself. And I think they both ultimately end up having an enormous effect on each other's lives in ways that neither of them anticipated. And that sort of duality was something that I just immediately went, that's - I've never seen that. For me as a filmmaker, you know, you look at the duality between those two men and you go, there's something really rich and dramatic there. FADEL: I think what struck me, too, is Kelley comes to this conclusion that there's not very much that sets Goering apart from the rest of humanity. There isn't a special kind of evil. And I thought about that a lot. I mean, I've worked in lots of different conflicts and watched human beings do absolutely awful things to other human beings. VANDERBILT: Goering, you know, was by all accounts an incredibly charming and funny individual. You know, somebody once described him as the best dinner party guest you'd ever have over to your house, which is not what you think of when you think of the Nazis. And I was just sort of taken by the idea of exploring that. And, you know, the fact that he loves his wife the same way that we love our spouses, that he loves his children the same way we love our children - to me, that, you know, doesn't excuse anything. It actually makes it all the more horrifying. FADEL: The moment that this is coming out into the world, with concerns around the rise of authoritarianism, and I wanted to just play one clip. It's an interaction between Goering and Kelley from the film. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NUREMBERG\") MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) Let's talk about Hitler. RUSSELL CROWE: (As Hermann Goering) That's interesting. You have not asked me this directly before. MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) I'm curious what the attraction was. He was a failed painter and not a very good soldier, yet was worshipped and revered. CROWE: (As Hermann Goering) He made us feel German again. FADEL: He made us feel German again. If you could just describe this moment in this film and what you think it says to an audience today in 2025. VANDERBILT: I mean, it's interesting because I wrote that scene 12 years ago. FADEL: Yeah. VANDERBILT: You know, and so it was relevant then, and I certainly feel it's relevant now. And I think, unfortunately, it will be relevant in the future. You know, Goering was someone who - from his perspective, you know, the Treaty of Versailles was a terrible thing. And they needed to build themselves back up, and they needed to feel pride in their country again. And that's one of the things that he, as well as Hitler, sort of exploited in terms of their rise to power. Nuremberg was a pretty remarkable moment in history where, you know, the world came together to choose justice over vengeance and do something that I think is - was truly a good act. FADEL: There was a moment during the trial where you show real footage that was shot in the concentration camps. VANDERBILT: Yes. FADEL: Emaciated survivors, bodies piled up. This - I had to almost look away, but I forced myself to watch where the bulldozers are just bulldozing, like, dozens of bodies on top of each other as if they're rubble. Tell me about that choice. VANDERBILT: It was something from the very beginning I knew I wanted to do. And as we were casting and I started being able to hire these incredible actors, I said to each of them, you know, listen. I know that you love doing research, and I love that about you. But do me a favor and don't watch the footage because on the day that we shoot this, I want it to be fresh to you. And we were in our courtroom set, which was built to exact specifications of the real Nuremberg courtroom, down to the inch. And we brought out the projector, and we had a moment of silence. And I had set up four cameras, one on each of our lead actors, and then we showed the film. And what you see in our movie is the reaction of those actors. Those images are, I think, as powerful today as they were 80 years ago. And I wanted to put you as an audience member in the same shoes as the people who were in the courtroom that day when this footage was first shown to the world. You know, one of the - you know, the reasons the trial were put on by Robert Jackson, Michael Shannon's character, was because he felt that this needed to be recorded - that if we just shoot these men and possibly make them martyrs, people generations later won't believe what happened. FADEL: The case law established in the Nuremberg trials is still used today... VANDERBILT: Yes. FADEL: ...Paved the way for the creation of an International Criminal Court. I want to play a moment from the film - the chief U.S. prosecutor, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, played by Michael Shannon, explaining his vision. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NUREMBERG\") MICHAEL SHANNON: (As Robert H. Jackson) It would have to be a completely international effort. All of the Allies would have to participate - the U.S., Britain, France, Russia. You can't do it without the Russians. Four international judges. WRENN SCHMIDT: (As Elsie Douglas) You're talking about a tribunal. SHANNON: (As Robert H. Jackson) Exactly. The world needs to know what these men did. SCHMIDT: (As Elsie Douglas) It's a logistical nightmare. SHANNON: (As Robert H. Jackson) I know, but it has to be done. FADEL: What is the historical significance of the trials today? VANDERBILT: I mean, I think it's enormous. It was the first international tribunal. It was sort of, you know - someone described it as sort of building the airplane while you flew it. The historical significance, hopefully, is that we remember there was a moment where something like this could happen and people chose to do the right thing, even though it wasn't the easy thing. Both of my grandfathers fought in World War II, so I grew up with stories about this period of time. I had friends who lost family members in the camps. You can read the books and you can watch the documentaries and you can hear the facts and figures, but a movie makes you feel things. FADEL: That's director James Vanderbilt. His new film is \"Nuremberg.\" Thank you so much. VANDERBILT: Thank you. And a note - Sony Pictures Classics is a financial supporter of NPR.

Why not? Is it OK to wait? \n         By Mara Gordon \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 7:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Q: I just found out I'm pregnant. According to my period tracking app, I'm about five weeks along. But I can't get a first prenatal appointment until I'm nine weeks in. I'm super stressed out. Why can't I see a doctor sooner? And is it really OK to wait that long? First of all, congratulations! And don't worry. It's normal to want to see a doctor right away when you see those two side-by-side lines on a positive pregnancy test. But it's also pretty typical to have trouble getting an appointment to confirm you're pregnant. A physician friend of mine also recently went through this. Even with insider connections at her hospital, she couldn't see a doctor for another month. So she texted one of the OB/GYNs in her office and asked her to do an ultrasound between her scheduled appointments! My friend was lucky she could access this workaround. But I've always wondered why early pregnancy care isn't available to those of us who don't have an OB/GYN on speed dial. Many prenatal providers won't schedule patients until eight or nine weeks of pregnancy — at the earliest. Waiting a month to see a doctor isn't necessarily a bad thing, since most pregnancies will go on to be healthy. But it can feel like a  long  time, since most high-sensitivity home pregnancy tests  can confirm a pregnancy  on the first day of your missed period, which is usually around four weeks along. So if you're eager for an earlier appointment, here's what you should know. Do you have a medical question you’d like an honest answer on? Write us at  thrive@npr.org , and we’ll consider your question for the column. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A lot of people want earlier prenatal care In one 2016 study, about  15% of participants  said they couldn't get a first prenatal appointment as quickly as they wanted. Dr. Kavita Vinekar , an OB/GYN whose work focuses on early pregnancy, thinks that number might be even higher. Vinekar got interested in caring for patients in the earliest stages of pregnancy because it's such a vulnerable period. She surveyed patients at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia and learned that people were doing whatever they could to confirm the pregnancy, even if prenatal practices were turning them away. Close to 50% of patients had gotten an ultrasound somewhere else before their first prenatal appointment, while 25% had visited an emergency room.  Almost 15% of those who had gotten an ultrasound had been to what's known as a crisis pregnancy center, which offers anti-abortion counseling without licensed medical care. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Why it's hard to get these appointments Seeing patients in the first weeks of pregnancy, Vinekar says, is a radical departure from what many doctors learn during training. In the earliest stages, it's hard to give patients definitive answers about the health of the pregnancy. That's because it can be difficult to visualize an early pregnancy on an ultrasound. \"We have been told: 'Do not see people in early pregnancy,'\" Vinekar said. '\"You're just going to open up a whole can of worms. You're going to be creating stress when they don't need to be stressed.'\" But some patients are stressed when they  can't  see a doctor, especially if they're worried they might be having a miscarriage. Unfortunately, Vinekar says that miscarriage risk is actually a major reason why prenatal practices won't schedule patients early on. They aren't set up to take care of the  estimated 15% of pregnancies that will end in the first trimester , so they try to delay taking on patients until eight or nine weeks, when miscarriage is less likely. Early pregnancy loss can be tricky to diagnose and may require multiple urgent follow-up appointments. Also, practices may not want to leave those appointment slots open, because if nobody schedules, they could lose money. Here's what you can do while you wait If you're waiting on a first prenatal appointment but want medical advice sooner, your best option may be trying to see your primary care provider. If you have an OB/GYN, you could make an appointment with them, too. In my primary care practice, I often talk to patients who have just found out that they're pregnant. They have questions about everything from miscarriage risk to whether or not they can eat sushi. Many of my pregnant patients start feeling nauseous weeks before their first prenatal appointment is scheduled. They're frustrated they can't see an OB/GYN to get some relief. So instead, they call me — and I'm happy to help out. If you're experiencing nausea, heartburn, or breast tenderness but don't yet have an OB/GYN appointment, don't hesitate to call your family doctor or visit an urgent care. Even if we aren't experts in pregnancy, we can usually offer treatment for these common — and unpleasant — symptoms. What to do if you are worried about miscarriage As a family doctor, I sometimes get calls from pregnant patients who are bleeding and cramping and are worried they're having a miscarriage. First, don't panic. Light spotting in pregnancy can be normal. I usually do my best to get my patient in for an urgent ultrasound in a radiology practice with experience diagnosing early pregnancy and miscarriage. Unfortunately, that can also sometimes take several weeks. If you already have an OB/GYN, you can also make an urgent appointment with that doctor. If you don't see anyone for routine reproductive health care, a Planned Parenthood or a community health center may also be able to get you in. Since only an  estimated 4% of miscarriages require ER-level care , I try to reassure my patients that what they're experiencing usually isn't life-threatening. Unless they're having severe bleeding, it can be safe to wait it out. And, of course, I always tell my patients that if they've had a miscarriage, it isn't their fault. Most miscarriages are due to abnormalities in the developing fetus. It's almost never due to something they've done wrong. Still, most patients want to confirm if they're having a miscarriage right away. In that case, the ER is always an option. Doctors there can usually do an ultrasound and help get pain under control. But because miscarriage is a high-stakes diagnosis and  not all doctors are trained  in early pregnancy ultrasound, the ER may not be able to answer all your questions. Future solutions for early care I hate having to tell my patients all this, but our health care system doesn't do a great job of caring for patients who are having miscarriages — or have anxiety about early pregnancy. Take the story of Asha Spacek-Hobbs, who had a pregnancy loss before her youngest was born. The Philadelphia mom couldn't get an urgent appointment with an OB/GYN. She said it was \"like trying to book a flight to Antarctica.\" But the ER experience, she says, wasn't definitive either. \"I left the hospital, believe it or not, not totally knowing if I actually had a miscarriage,\" Spacek-Hobbs said. \"No one would actually say it.\" Vinekar has seen this all too many times. \"We've historically shied away and abandoned them,\" she said. \"Maybe that's actually the time they need us the most.\" That's why Vinekar and her team have started a clinic they call the Jefferson Early Pregnancy Program, which is almost like an urgent care for people who have just found out they're pregnant. When patients call in, they're offered appointments within a few days. Vinekar hopes these early pregnancy appointments can help patients get evidence-based miscarriage care right away — without waiting for hours in an emergency room. And she hopes her model will spread so it's easier for people around the country to get early pregnancy care. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604818","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"When the dust settles on the shutdown deal, Democrats will likely still have the edge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the political fallout from the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended after a Senate vote that allowed the government to reopen without extending health care subsidies.

the shutdown deal, Democrats will likely still have the edge \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         On its face, the likely  beginning of the path  to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history is a major Democratic capitulation. Most congressional Democrats were against the deal that eight of the senators, who caucus with them, crossed the aisle to vote and reopen the government. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the move a \"terrible mistake\"; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it was indefensible; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, declared it a \"policy and political disaster.\" And there were far harsher things said about the deal on social media across the political spectrum of people left of center, not just the most progressive. Make no mistake: bridging the divide is going to be a significant challenge. But despite the intense blowback, the result in the end might not be all that bad for Democrats in next year's midterm elections. Consider that affordability was the dominant issue in the off-year elections, where  Democrats won sweeping victories . If it's the most important issue next year — and it very likely will be — then Democrats will likely retain the advantage. What's more, if Republicans do vote against health care subsidy extensions in December — when a promised vote is to take place as part of this shutdown deal — then the GOP will fully own the increased health care costs that come with it. Democrats could also look like the adults who took the high road, recognizing the very real pain that a lot of people were beginning to feel when President Trump and his administration were beginning to turn the screws on the most vulnerable. So, Democrats' biggest challenge heading into next year's midterms may be keeping progressives on their side — and fired up to vote — after what many of them are viewing as the latest show of weakness from a party, as they see it, defined by that weakness. A Democratic vise Democrats put themselves in a very difficult position from the very beginning of this fight. Any acute observer could have seen this coming — and realize Democrats had nothing but bad options. Republicans dug in, figuring at least enough Democrats couldn't handle the pain of millions losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits as well as federal worker furloughs and layoffs. And they were right. \"Most of us up here have voted repeatedly with the Democratic strategy,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"But after 40 days, it wasn't going to work.\" It's hard to \"win\" a fight when one side broadly cares about whether the government is open and working properly and the other thinks government is the problem. For Kaine and the seven others who crossed over to join most Republicans in voting to end the shutdown, a commitment to hold a vote to extend health care subsidies, combined with the protections for federal workers and SNAP benefits, was enough. \"I don't think much of anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who voted repeatedly to end the shutdown. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, is one of the three Democrats who has also been voting to end the shutdown, said bluntly: \"It wasn't working. It's been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\" \"Waiting another week, or another month, wouldn't deliver a better outcome,\" New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. \"It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country.\" Not everyone agrees with that reasoning, including swing-state Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan. \"I always said it's got to do something concrete on health care,\" she said of an agreement to reopen the government. \"And it's hard to see how that happened.\" Leadership problems Democratic leaders also were ostensibly against the deal to reopen the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no, though there are questions about whether Schumer allowed the senators, who went ahead with the votes, to do so. None of the senators who came out in favor of the shutdown deal are in imminent political jeopardy, given they're not facing reelection next year, and two of them are retiring. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Leader Schumer, are opposing this bill in the Senate,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday. He pointed out that the Trump administration's actions when it comes to federal workers leaves most Democrats \"deeply skeptical\" of their \"intentions.\" And on health care, Republicans, he noted, have not acted in \"good faith,\" given that it's the party that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times. \"It doesn't change the core problem here,\" Jeffries said of the shutdown deal. \"We need to decisively address the Republican health care crisis on behalf of working-class Americans, everyday Americans and middle-class Americans.\" But Schumer already faced significant pushback when he abandoned the fight in March and voted to keep the government open. And given the party's movement toward ousting older leaders, the shutdown deal could spell trouble for the 74-year-old New Yorker as a party leader, even if he didn't vote for it. A changing party — from pragmatism to pugilism in the age of Trump Schumer is certainly not representative of how the Democratic Party is changing. And the moderates, who signed onto this deal, also very much represent the old guard of the party. For as much that's made of how much the GOP has changed since Trump came into office — and it has been a lot — the Democrats have changed as well. Democrats have moved from pragmatism to pugilism. As an example of that, in April of 2017, just after Trump began his first term, an  NBC poll found  that 6-in-10 Democrats favored making compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation. But that has completely flipped. As of March of this year, the last time there was a threat of a shutdown, two-thirds of Democrats said they think Democrats in Congress should instead stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington. Not every progressive sees what happened as a total disaster for the left. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who is generally a pretty pragmatic progressive, sees a silver lining. He described the deal as \"embarrassing,\" but  sees progress for the left : “[T]here’s a difference between the deal itself and where the deal leaves Democrats and the broader anti-Trump opposition. This deal shows us that Democrats still don’t have the caucus they need for this fight that will be going on at least through this decade. But the shutdown also accomplished a lot. And not withstanding the WTF fumble at the 10-yard line, it’s still a dramatically different caucus than we had in March. … Democratic voters need to keep demanding more, keep up the pressure and keep purging the Senate caucus of senators who are not up to the new reality.” He also points out that if this deal goes through, there will be another funding deadline at the end of January. At that point, if Democrats don't extract health care extensions or anything else of consequence, there will be another opportunity for leverage. Over the next year, there will also likely be primaries from the left and expect the shutdown positioning to be a litmus test for those primaries — and for 2028. In the meantime, Democratic officials are banking on voters having a short-term memory, that with time, progressives will take a victory in the progress they've made in moving the party to a more fighting stance — and the issue landscape will propel them to winning next year. And winning cures a lot of divisions. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Here's where the longest federal government shutdown stands. The Senate voted last night to end it. The House has yet to vote. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Republicans got roughly what they demanded, reopening the government without extending subsidies for health insurance. Just enough Senate Democrats agreed to do without extending those subsidies, although the Senate at least will vote on them soon. So what does that mean for the party that was trying to find some way to assert itself? FADEL: Coming up, we'll hear from Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. We begin with the big picture. INSKEEP: NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro's been following that. Domenico, good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Great to be with you. INSKEEP: What's a way to think about this result? MONTANARO: Well, you know, Democrats are certainly right now getting a lot of backlash from the left and, you know, for some understandable reasons. I mean, they feel like they continue to get rolled, that the party promises one thing and then, in the end, caves or doesn't quite keep up the fight. So you understand a lot of the irritability from the left about this toward Democrats. But it might not be as bad for Democrats in the long run here into the 2026 midterm elections. I mean, they have the opportunity, Democrats, to look like the adults in the room who care, you know, if people go hungry. And they also raised the issue of health care subsidies, which many weren't talking about before this shutdown fight. INSKEEP: Yeah. MONTANARO: And if they get this promised vote in December on health care subsidies, then it's certainly going to draw a dividing line and Republicans are really going to own that issue. And there were divides between, you know, people in the party before these off-year elections. Democrats still swept across the country. And the reason why was because of that issue of affordability. That's still likely to be the top issue next year, too. INSKEEP: Oh, this is interesting. So if Democrats did well in last week's elections and at least raised their issue, even if they didn't win the issue in this shutdown fight, is there any particular danger for the Democrats who voted to reopen the government? MONTANARO: You know, I think we're going to see potentially more primaries in the next year. I think the left has certainly gotten more activist and more engaged in this fight. But remember, most Democratic members of Congress were against this move. INSKEEP: Yeah. MONTANARO: You know, I think they're going to try to sell that to their constituents. I think what we're seeing is also indicative of a changing Democratic Party, one that's moved from really a pragmatism to a pugilism in the age of Trump, really wanting fighters. It was a party that was far more willing to compromise than it is now, and polling is showing that. There was an NBC poll, for example, in 2017, that found that 6 in 10 Democrats are more likely favoring compromising with Trump. During his second term here, that's flipped. Two-thirds of Democrats earlier this year, in that same poll, said they thought members of the party should stand on principle instead. That was back in March, right around the time when there was almost a shutdown before Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pulled the plug and worked with Republicans to keep it open. INSKEEP: Is Senator Schumer in any trouble? MONTANARO: I think he's in a really tough position, frankly. I mean, he held the line for 40 days, saying... INSKEEP: Yeah. MONTANARO: ...Don't reopen the government unless Republicans negotiate on these health care subsidies, but senators defied his public comments. So either he was unable to keep everyone on the same page, or he tacitly allowed folks to vote this way. And there's some question about that because none of the people who came out in favor of this deal are up for reelection next year. Two of them are retiring. It was really a group that could weather the political blowback on this. And look, he's 74. He's not where the party is heading right now. It would not be surprising, as I've heard other Democrats and Democratic strategists say, to see him not leading the party in 2027, regardless of the outcome of next year's midterm. INSKEEP: Who has the advantage heading into those midterms? MONTANARO: You know, I still think it's hard not to see it being Democrats. You know, affordability was the main issue of the past election. It's very likely to be again next year. And if that's the case, and the cost of living is still pinching people's pockets, then with Trump and Republicans in charge, it's still going to be an edge for Democrats. Plus, Democrats have the issues on their side. In addition to affordability, there's health care. And as we know, congressional elections and control of the House are determined in these swing districts, and winning is going to cure a lot of ills if the environment stays the way it does. INSKEEP: And also people keep voting against whoever is in. So... MONTANARO: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Democrats have the advantage there. Domenico, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. INSKEEP: Domenico Montanaro. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This news article features a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, showcasing live musical performances on a small, intimate stage.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Music","Live Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97533","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:26:00-05:00","title":"Space forecasters say severe solar storms could hit Earth and trigger auroras","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Space weather forecasters have issued an alert for severe solar storms originating from coronal mass ejections on the sun, which could reach Earth by Tuesday night and early Wednesday, causing vibrant auroras visible as far south as Alabama and Northern California.

Earth and trigger auroras \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 1:26 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NEW YORK — Space weather forecasters issued an alert on Tuesday for incoming severe solar storms that could produce colorful northern lights and temporarily disrupt communications. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the past few days, the sun has burped out several bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections that could reach Earth Tuesday night and early Wednesday. The potential severe geomagnetic storms could disrupt radio and GPS communications, according to forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. How bright the auroras are and how far south they are visible will depend on when the solar bursts get here and how they interact with Earth's atmosphere. The vibrant displays could be visible across much of the northern U.S., and as far south as Alabama and Northern California. How northern lights happen The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come. Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere. Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major face-lift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way. Last year, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And soon afterward, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City. The sun's active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won't be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA. How solar storms affect Earth Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth. When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth's magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. Severe storms are capable of scrambling other radio and GPS communications. In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and set telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam. Space weather experts aren't able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth. How to see auroras Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app. Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely. Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren't visible to the naked eye. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978629","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-23","timeOfPublication":"20:45:15+00:00","title":"U.S. Immigration Detention Centers Face Human Rights Criticism Over Treatment of Detainees","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent report has revealed that a significant number of individuals have been detained in immigration detention centers across the United States, with some being held for extended periods without proper legal representation or access to essential medical care.

The Gottmans' new book, published in January,  Fight Right: How Successful Couples Turn Conflict into Connection , is a guide to doing just that. It aims to teach couples \"how to have conflicts that don't push them apart but instead produce connection and compassion for one another,\" says Julie Schwartz Gottman.   Pulling from decades of relationship research and thousands of hours of interviews and therapy sessions with couples, the Gottmans identify some of the most common fights — and offer research-backed solutions for coming out the other side stronger.  1. 'The Flood'  What it is:  According to the Gottmans, feeling \"flooded\" is the state of being psychologically and physically overwhelmed during a conflict.  \"When you feel deeply attacked and there's no way out, people will move into flight or fight\" mode, in which stress hormones course through the body, says Julie Schwartz Gottman. As a result, \"they cannot think straight. They cannot hear well. It's a terrible state to be in.\" What this conflict looks like in real life:  Your friend says something insensitive to your girlfriend over dinner. \"You never back me up!\" she complains on the way home. \"You're supposed to be on my side!\"  You try to defend yourself, but she won't let you off the hook. Your heart rate rises. Your palms go sweaty. You turn away and go silent, refusing to respond to anything she has to say.  How to handle this type of conflict:  Put your fight on pause, say the Gottmans.   This idea may seem strange for couples who follow the adage \"never go to sleep angry.\" But the Gottmans say if one or both partners are \"flooded,\" taking a break is the best way to keep a bad argument from getting worse.  So the next time you feel your jaw clench or your stomach drop during a spat, stop the discussion and ask your partner to take a break. A pause can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as 24 hours – aim for enough time that you'll both have cooled down, says Julie Schwartz Gottman. Once you agree on a timeframe, get out of each other's space and – here's the hardest part –  don't think about the fight,  John Gottman says.  Instead of feeling like a victim, dwelling on what your partner said or planning out your argument, Julie Schwartz Gottman says it's important to spend this time away from your partner doing something self-soothing. Read a book, listen to a podcast, go for a run – do anything that will give your body \"a chance to metabolize all the stress hormones\" and allow you to come back to the conflict with a calm body and a clear mind, she says. 2. 'The Standoff' What it is:  A \"standoff\" is a disagreement in which both sides feel they have to \"win\" the argument, says John Gottman. It's a common problem. In a 2020 study of over 40,000 couples beginning couples therapy, the Gottmans found that  84 percent of the heterosexual couples  they interviewed said they were struggling with an inability to compromise.  What it looks like in real life:  You and your partner have reached an impasse about where to send your son to school. You feel strongly about the local public school down the street. But your partner wants him to attend private school like he did. How to handle this type of conflict:  To get out of gridlock and find some common ground, the Gottmans suggest doing an exercise they created for couples in therapy who can't find a compromise. They call it the \"Bagel Method\" – named because of its shape. It's designed to help people in relationships understand the core of their desires in a disagreement and find the validity and beauty in their partner's point of view.  To do the \"Bagel Method\" exercise, each partner draws two concentric ovals on a piece of paper. In the inside oval, write down what you absolutely cannot compromise on regarding the issue. Write down what you  can  compromise on in the outside oval.  So, the inside oval for you might say: \"my son will have a quality education,\" \"he will stay connected to the local community\" and \"we're supporting public education.\" Your outside oval might say: \"maybe we can move him to private school during high school,\" \"he can get involved in the local community in other ways\" and \"we can ask him when he's old enough to weigh in on the decision.\"  Then, compare and contrast your \"bagel\" with your partner. Ask each other why the things in the inner circle are so important to you. Discuss where your flexible areas overlap and workshop some possible compromises. Here, that might look like sending your son to private school but enrolling him in local after-school soccer, then assessing how things are going after a year.  The Gottmans say after doing this exercise, couples are often surprised by how much flexibility they have and how much compassion this creates between them.  \"It's so important to understand that your partner is not your clone. They are a different human being with a different internal world,\" says Julie Schwartz Gottman. So, conflict is an understandable and healthy part of being in a relationship, say the Gottmans. When it happens, just remember it's possible to \"communicate with love and affection, even when you disagree.\"  3. 'The Bomb Drop' (The Harsh Startup)  What it is:  This fight is characterized by a harsh startup, attacking your partner with anger and criticism, often out of the blue and without context for the other person, says John Gottman – hence the name.  What this conflict looks like in real life:  Let's say you and your partner are trying to save up, but you get the credit card bill and find they've overspent again. As soon as your husband walks through the door you yell, \"I can't believe how irresponsible you are!\" How to handle this type of conflict:  Starting a conflict with negativity like this often portends poor outcomes, say the Gottmans. In fact, their research shows that  the first three minutes of a fight  determines not only the way a conversation will go but also the future of a relationship. The 1999 study looked at the behavior of 124 newlywed couples and found that when couples began a fight with negative emotions like criticism, contempt, defensiveness or stonewalling, they were very likely to break up down the road.   So if you and your partner want to go the distance, the Gottmans suggest starting your disagreements with a gentler approach. \"What that means is you point your finger not at your partner, but at yourself,\" says John Gottman. In order to do that, try using the Gottman formula, developed in response to that 1999 study, for soft start-ups: Say: \"I feel (emotion) about (situation/problem) and I need (a positive and specific action your partner can take to help improve the situation).\"   So, \"You're so irresponsible with money!\" transforms into: \"I feel really stressed (the emotion) about our budget this month – it looks like we're going to be short again (the situation). Can we sit down together and plan how to cut some of our expenses (the positive need)?\"  Hurling blanket accusations or criticisms gives your partner no choice but to go on the defensive. But this approach creates space for your partner to understand the issue and show up for you, says Julie Schwartz Gottman.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. So happy almost Valentine's Day. You know those little Valentine's Day cards that have the cute, corny messages on them, like the classic be mine, or maybe there's a bunny holding a heart and it says somebunny loves you? You know what those never say? Let's fight. Everybody talks about the romance of relationships, the red roses and endless sex. But nobody really wants to think about the disagreements that are a completely normal part of a partnership. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: A lot of people really don't know how to manage conflict. JOHN GOTTMAN: What we're seeing a lot is couples in the United States are engaged in kind of a standoff. So they start by presenting the issue as a defect in their partner's personality, which just leads the partner to become defensive. And it escalates very quickly into a standoff, an attack, defend, standoff. And when that happens, it really is very dangerous for the future of the relationship. SEGARRA: Any of that sound familiar? If so, it's time to change how you view your disagreements. JOHN GOTTMAN: Conflict really has a purpose, and the purpose is mutual understanding. SEGARRA: That was Julie and John Gottman, world-renowned researchers and clinical psychologists who've been married for more than 30 years and have spent the last 40 dedicated to the study and practice of fostering healthy, long-lasting relationships. They've watched thousands of couples argue, and they are able to predict with over 90% accuracy if a couple will stay together after witnessing just three minutes of a conflict. Yeah, how you fight matters a lot more than you might think. The Gottman's new book, \"Fight Right,\" details the keys to successful conflict found in couples that master love. JOHN GOTTMAN: A couple that stays together and, you know, pretty much likes one another over time, and they're pretty satisfied with the relationship, that's a master. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Versus a disaster, which is a couple that typically has really terrible conflicts and grows more and more distant and more and more unhappy. So we don't want to be disasters. But the great thing is that disasters can become masters simply by reconfiguring how they talk about their conflicts and become more connected. JOHN GOTTMAN: Good point, Julie. SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to learn how to fight right. Reporter Andee Tagle talks to the Gottmans about some of the most common fights in relationships, why they happen and how we can turn conflict into connection. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE: If you want to fight right, you first need to understand what Julie and John call the conflict culture of your relationship. Being aware of your fighting style and that of your partner's will make it easier to connect amid conflict. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: So first of all, what people can do is ask how was conflict handled in your family when you were growing up? A lot of times, we will either imitate what our parents or our caretakers did when we were growing up or we will go the opposite direction. And that background determines what our culture of conflict is. We might be conflict avoiders, which means we may just agree to disagree, but we don't resolve problems by really hashing out our own position on the issue and trying to reach a compromise. Or we may validate each other in talking about conflict, which means we'll express our feelings somewhat but very rationally, and we will move to problem-solving very quickly. We may not explore as deeply as we need to what's going on in our own position on the issue. And third, we may be volatile, which means lots of emotion, lots of intensity, lots of passion when we express our emotions. None of those is bad. It's simply a matter of recognizing which you are - avoidant, validating or volatile - and talking with your partner about what kind of discussion and conflict helps you feel more comfortable and more listened to. TAGLE: OK. Let me just make sure I understand. In order to understand our styles, to start, we need to interrogate our past and interrogate our influences. What else? What's next? JOHN GOTTMAN: One of the things that's very important, Andee, is the ratio of positivity to negativity in a conflict discussion. And what we found was, whatever style of conflict you have, the masters of relationships, the ones that stay together happily, have this ratio of five times as much positive emotion as negative emotion in a conflict discussion, which means that they're really creating this sort of lubricated climate of understanding by just expressing interest, and nodding their heads, and, you know, vocalizing and saying, oh, interesting, tell me more about that, you know? Oh, wow, you know? And that kind of feedback, that eye contact and vocalization lubricates the wheels of communication, whereas when there's a standoff, people don't express any affection. There's very little humor. And they're kind of, you know, like stone walls just sort of standing there and really being opposite of one another and disagreeing with their partner constantly as opposed to trying to reach mutual understanding. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Let's call this takeaway two. Whenever possible, but especially in conflict, aim for the positive - a little humor, offering some validation or a simple, OK, I see your point, can go a long way in maintaining a successful relationship. Now let's turn to some of the most common fights people have. The first one I want to cover with you, I am extremely guilty of. But if you tell my husband, I will deny... (LAUGHTER) TAGLE: ...That I said that. You call it the bomb drop. Please, can you tell us what we're talking about? Give us an example of the bomb drop fight. JOHN GOTTMAN: Sure. A lot of times, it comes from not feeling entitled to really ask for what you need and suppressing your irritation and your upset and not talking about it. And then when it finally does come out, it's almost like you've dropped a bomb on the relationship. And what typically happens is you express your discomfort by describing your partner, not describing yourself. So we call it harsh startup, and you really describe your partner in very negative terms and say, you know, the problem in this relationship is that you're so selfish; you're inconsiderate; you only think about yourself. And they go on and on, really pointing a finger at their partner, and that's guaranteed to lead to defensiveness. So that's what a bomb drop is. TAGLE: The defining quality of this type of fight is that it kind of comes out of nowhere, you know? Like, you're walking along, and everything's fine. It seems like you're having a good day, and it's suddenly like, I can't believe you, right? JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. TAGLE: You have been awful for the past 10 years. (LAUGTHER) TAGLE: Right? Is that - do I have that right? JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. Exactly, you got it. TAGLE: OK. So we don't want to do the harsh startup or drop that bomb. John, can you explain the alternative, what you call the soft startup? JOHN GOTTMAN: What that means is, you point your finger not at your partner but at yourself and say what you feel about a situation - not about a person, but about a situation - that is irritating or upsetting you. And then you talk about what you do need. And in effect, the masters are giving their partner a recipe for succeeding with them, a way to shine for them. So I feel, about what, and here's what I need. And a positive need is the opposite of what you don't need, what you don't want, what you're upset about. So you really have to do a little bit of work to think about, what do you want? And so this softened startup has those three parts to it - I feel, about what, and here's what my positive need is. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Let me give you an example of the difference between a harsh startup and a softened startup. So let's say that your partner's mother is coming over for dinner tonight. TAGLE: OK. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: And she always finds something to criticize you about, no matter what. It's your cooking, it's your cleaning, you know, whatever - or your child raising, she always criticizes you. So you want to bring this up to your partner. A harsh startup would sound like this. Dear, your mother is a wart on the back of humanity. TAGLE: (Laughter). JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: All right. OK. How's your partner going to respond to that? Probably not well, unless your partner totally agrees with you, that's always a possibility. However, softened startup would sound like this. Honey, I'm really feeling nervous - there's the emotion - about your mother coming over to dinner tonight. She often find something to criticize me for. That's the situation. Would you please stand up for me if she does that again? There's the positive need. That's how your partner can shine for you. JOHN GOTTMAN: And Andee, let me contrast that with when you do this following thing, then I feel this way, and I don't like that, that's in an attack mode because it immediately puts the other person in a defensive place, you know? So here, you're not saying you're the fault of my emotion, you're saying this situation is really frustrating for me or upsetting to me, and here's what I need from you. And that's a whole different way of being gentler in starting up talking about a conflict issue. TAGLE: So takeaway three - when it's time to fight, start soft. That formula again is I feel plus situation plus positive need. By using that I statement, keeping the discussion about only the matter at hand rather than your whole relationship or your partner's character, and asking them for exactly what you need to feel connected, you're providing your partner space to react calmly and a roadmap for a successful conversation. OK. Moving on to another type of fight - the flood. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: So this part of John's earliest research that was so significant. He would have a couple talking to one another, sitting in chairs, looking as calm as can be. But he and his colleague, Dr. Robert Levenson, also measured heart rate. They measured how much people jiggled in their chair. They looked at their facial expressions. And what they saw, particularly in heart rate, is that people could be speaking fairly calmly or maybe shutting down, but their heart rates were over 100 beats a minute. What that signifies is that your whole physiological system is very, very upset, and you've moved into fight or flight. Now, what are the situations that make you feel that way, either facing a saber-tooth tiger or facing your partner who's criticizing you... TAGLE: (Laughter). JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: ...And attacking you. And when you feel deeply attacked and there's no way out, people will move into flight or fight and they cannot think straight, they cannot hear well, it's a terrible state to be in. We call that flooding. The antidote to that is that as soon as somebody notices the signs that they're starting to flood - and everybody may have different signs of that in their own bodies, like getting hot or maybe their jaw getting clenched or their inability to breathe deeply - you have to say to your partner, can we please take a break right now? And then it's very important for that person to say when they will come back to continue the conversation. The other person needs to say, sure, let's take a break, and they will feel better knowing from the other person that they will be able to continue the conversation in a certain amount of time. While you're on the break, here's another thing that's a little bit different than what you would think... TAGLE: Sure. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: ...You do not think about the fight. So what you have to do is something self-soothing during your break that calms you down. It could be just reading a book, reading a magazine, or meditating, going for a run, listening to music, anything that takes your mind off the fight so your body has a chance to metabolize all the stress hormones that have been released in your body from being in fight or flight, and your body can calm down. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway four - it's OK to put your fight on pause - really, seriously. This one might feel hard for those of us who were raised on the phrase, never go to bed angry. But the research shows, when you're feeling overwhelmed, it's probably best to take a break. John and Julie recommend anywhere from 20 minutes up to a 24-hour pause to reset, calm down and then come back to the conflict table with a clear head. Next up - tackling the fight called the standoff. It's the kind of fight where both sides feel they have to win. But John and Julie say conflicts in relationships shouldn't have winners and losers. Here's what to do instead. You talk about an intervention in the book called the bagel method to, quote, \"help couples in conflict find a true compromise that feels good to both partners.\" Can you tell me a little bit more about the bagel method? JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Yes. So John and I really, really love bagels. Therefore, it's the bagel method. But for some of you not being familiar with bagels, you can call it the doughnut method. So here is what it looks like. If you take out a piece of paper, and you draw two concentric circles - a small one in the middle and a great big one outside that - it looks like a doughnut. In the center circle, before talking to one another, what are the things in your position on the issue that you cannot compromise on, that are so important to you, so core to your identity, to who you are, that if you gave up one of those or some of those, it would feel like you were giving up the bones of your body? But now listen. In the outer circle, this is where you put the things you're more flexible about, and those tend to be the nitty-gritty details of what you might arrive at for a compromise, like when something happens, where it happens, whose goes first, how much money do you spend, how much do you save, et cetera. How long does something last? TAGLE: Maybe your partner wants to move to sunny California, but you want to be closer to your family in Boston. Or your boyfriend wants to keep renting, but you're ready to buy a condo. Try takeaway five. If you've come to an impasse, use the bagel method. Write out what's truly non-negotiable on the inside and where you might have room in the outer circle. You might be surprised by what you find. JOHN GOTTMAN: Compromises often fail because people give up too much just for the sake of peace in the relationship, and so they don't put in those inflexible areas what's really important to them about their position on this issue. And when you give something really central up just for the sake of peace, it builds resentment, as opposed to in the bagel method, you can actually say, here's why this is so important to me; here's why I'm kind of inflexible about this; here's why that has to be part of our compromise; I have to feel like my dream is being honored in some way. And then the compromise doesn't get sabotaged in the future. TAGLE: Great distinction. So compromise is important, but it's also really important that you be true to yourself within it, that you not give up too much. JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. Exactly. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: And honor your partner's dreams as well, if you possibly can. JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. TAGLE: Our last takeaway, takeaway six - repair. Repair. Repair. This idea comes up again and again in the Gottmans' research. The couples who make it make an effort to stay connected and reduce harm to one another before, during and after a fight. That can look like a comment, a gesture, a joke. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: A repair is something that takes you right on back to the high road through saying something helpful right in that moment. JOHN GOTTMAN: Well, the thing about repair is that it needs to really be perceived as a repair by your partner. So one thing you can do that's very different is to say, I'm feeling defensive. Can you say that in a gentle way? You know, now, you're not getting defensive. You're just saying, I'm feeling defensive, or, I need to calm down, or, your point of view is very interesting; say more about it. These are all repairs that you can use. And we actually spent seven years - two graduate students of mine mostly did this, Amber Tabares and Janice Driver - studying what repairs worked and what repairs failed. Any repair you would use in a business meeting will fail in a love relationship, so things like, oh, let's consider our alternatives and evaluate them - anything that's really intellectual. But anything that's emotional, really, and self-disclosing really works much better, saying, you know, I feel like we're getting stuck; you know, tell me more about your point of view so I understand it better. TAGLE: So repair - very, very important, very critical - also, usually the most difficult part, at least if you're me, it can feel impossible to reach across the table and hold your spouse's hand after a big fight. You know, even when or maybe especially if you know it could make a big difference in that moment, right? What advice can you share with us about making and accepting repair attempts? JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: OK. So the one that you described, which is taking your partner's hand, is really extreme, and I'm right there with you, Andee. I could never do that, either. But if you've said the wrong thing, and you're aware that you've said the wrong thing, you can say as a repair, or your partner can, you know what? I just blurted that out. Let me try again. That's a repair. How about bringing in some positivity, a little bit of positivity? What John was talking about when he talked about the ratio that's so important, of five positives to one negative to make it a healthy conflict conversation, well, positives can include things like, interesting, I never thought of it that way; fair enough; good point; oh, OK; tell me more. Those are all positives. JOHN GOTTMAN: And we quote William Shakespeare here in \"Merchant Of Venice,\" where Portia says, \"the quality of mercy is not strained. It drops as the gentle rain from heaven, and it blesses both he who shows mercy and he who gives mercy.\" And the same thing with repair. Both people are blessed by a repair that's effective - the person making the repair attempt and the person receiving the repair attempt - so that if both people, you know, know about repair, then they can use it together. TAGLE: Julie, John, thank you so much for joining us today. I have learned so much. You've given me so much to work with. I really appreciate it. JOHN GOTTMAN: Thank you, Andee. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Andee, this has been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK. Let's recap. The conflict in your relationship is an opportunity for connection. Here are things to remember to fight right. Takeaway one - understand your fighting style. Are you avoidant, volatile, validating? And how does that contrast with your partner's culture of conflict? Takeaway two - aim for five positive interactions for every negative interaction. That's the sweet spot for a solid relationship. Takeaway three - start soft. That three-part formula is, I feel, plus the situation and finally ask for a positive need. Takeaway four - if you're feeling flooded, put your fight on pause. Decide with your partner how long you need to cool down. Then walk away, and do anything else but think about your fight until it's time to return to the table. Takeaway five - if you need to find a compromise, try the bagel method - non-negotiables in the center, items of flexibility in the outer ring. Takeaway six - repair, repair, repair. I know - trust me; I know - just how hard it can feel to reach out to your partner in the middle of conflict, but remember; you're on the same team with the same goal of understanding each other. Offer each other grace wherever you can.

Click here to subscribe now . When I sit at my desk, I'm constantly   confronted by chaos: Post-its in every color, candy wrappers, multiple headphones, books and mugs of tea.  I can never seem to get a handle on my clutter. How can I clean up my space — and keep it that way?  That's a question that  Star Hansen  thinks a lot about. She's a professional organizer who teaches classes on home organizing and has been featured in over 30 TV shows and online series on the subject.  She believes that keeping your home neat and tidy is a continual process. \"Organizing is not a one-and-done task to complete,\" she says. You have to take the time to \"create systems that work for you.\" Hansen shares more about her decluttering philosophy — along with useful strategies to keep our messes at bay.  1. Understand your clutter  Hansen says everyone's clutter tells a personal story. \"What becomes clutter and where your clutter accumulates can say a lot about what's going on with you.\"   If you have unwanted piles of stuff accumulating around your house, ask yourself:   \"What's making this hard to get rid of?\" she says. \"A lot of times, the trip-up is from holding on to the past or wanting a different reality than the one we're living in.\" That blazer that hasn't fit for years? Maybe it reveals a yearning for your former profession. Those 20 pairs of chopsticks in your kitchen drawer? Maybe they're speaking to your guilt around waste and sustainability.  When you understand the reasons behind your clutter, says Hansen, it's a lot easier to know what to keep and what to get rid of.  2. Start small  When it comes to organizing, don't bite off more than you can chew, says Hansen. If you start off with too big a goal, you might get discouraged if the job takes too long. So don't try to revamp your entire garage in one afternoon. Instead, start with something less challenging, like your purse or one single bathroom drawer. Save more complicated items, like tax paperwork, or sentimental items, like family photos and memorabilia, for last. These kinds of organizational projects often take the most time and emotional energy, says Hansen, so you'll want to build up your decluttering muscle first. You can also work within short time constraints. Say you only have an hour to declutter your home this week. Hansen says to divide that time into 20-minute intervals. For the first 20 minutes, look for trash to throw away. The next 20 minutes, identify anything you want to give away or donate. Spend the last 20 minutes putting items back where they belong.  Setting realistic goals and breaking tasks up in to manageable portions can help keep you invested in the process, says Hansen. \"What we're looking for is small wins.\" 3. Take the emotion out of it Once you've chosen an area to declutter, take inventory of everything you have in that space, says Hansen. If you're tackling your kitchen, for example, take every item out of the drawers and cabinets and sort them into organized piles on your kitchen countertop and dining room table.  Then comes the hard part: figuring out what to get rid of. At this stage, Hansen suggests looking at your items with neutral eyes. Go through your things \"as though you're helping a friend and none of your stuff means anything to you,\" she says.   That attitude can help you let go of things you don't need but feel sentimental about, like the dented frying pan you've had since college, or extra items you keep around just in case, like the five wooden spoons in your utensil drawer.  4. Ditch the fancy storage boxes  Decluttering doesn't have to come with a hefty price tag, says Hansen. Most of the time, the containers you need to organize your stuff are already in your clutter somewhere – so shop your own closet first, she says. Instead of buying new drawer organizers, use old shoeboxes, gift boxes or even Tupperware. Be creative, says Hansen — that's one of the joys of decluttering.  Hansen likes using old iPhone boxes, for example, to store small items. They're sturdy enough to last a long time and can be used for anything from jewelry to office supplies.  5. Make it easy to stay organized It's easy to be organized the day after decluttering, when tidiness is still top of mind. But what happens when you come home from a trip and are too tired to unpack your luggage? Or when you get the flu and are too sick to clean up? The key to staying organized is to create practices that can be easily maintained, says Hansen. \"Make a system that works for you even when you've got to work, when you've got a cold.\" For example, label storage containers on all four sides so they're easier to spot. Make sure  your most used items are always the easiest to reach.  Most importantly, she says, celebrate your progress as you go. \"Brag to your friend, show your spouse, allow yourself to really enjoy the fact that you've done something,\" she says. \"It's not a small thing to get a handle on our clutter.\" More great organizing tips from Life Kit Organize your kitchen cabinets.

Give a little, get a lot with NPR Plus. ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   This is NPR's LIFE KIT. I'm Andee Tagle, a reporter for this show. And also, I'm a bit of a mess, literally. Looking at my desk, I see reminder Post-its in every color lining my computer screens, hair ties hanging off the pens in my trusty pen cup, dusty photobooth pictures from a wedding last spring, a leftover candy wrapper from yesterday's afternoon snack and four - yes, four - different water cups and water bottles, amazingly, all half empty, in or around my immediate space. I share this embarrassing, overly cluttered truth with you because I could use some help. Are you ready to jump into it? STAR HANSEN: I am, yeah. TAGLE: Lucky for me, Star Hansen specializes in fresh starts. HANSEN: I'm a certified professional organizer and clutter whisperer. TAGLE: Star's decluttering philosophy has been featured everywhere, from HGTV to the OWN network to a TED Talk. She's all about understanding the story behind the messes we make for ourselves and getting to the why of the things that take up space in our lives. HANSEN: Clutter does speak to us. Clutter is talking to us because we are talking to ourselves through our clutter. And so what becomes clutter and where your clutter accumulates says a lot about what's going on with you. TAGLE: So my desk? It's shouting at me about busy workdays and procrastination and fast approaching deadlines. I like to call the mess in my office creative chaos. But if I'm really being honest, all that stuff probably impedes my work more than it helps. And there are a lot of different things in life like this. HANSEN: Clutter looks like anything you can imagine. Clutter looks like the way we talk to ourselves. It looks like our calendar. It looks like our Netflix queue. You know, it's not just physical stuff. It's anything that is causing chaos in our lives. TAGLE: So what can we do about it? Star says the first step is setting any shame aside. HANSEN: What we want to do is start looking at our clutter with curiosity instead of judgment. TAGLE: Then accept that decluttering isn't a one-time fix. It's an ongoing process that requires reflection, not just pretty boxes and a label maker, But we'll talk about that part of it, too. HANSEN: You know, it's like we have this assumption that we should just jump and get rid of things, right? Thanks to all the, like, makeover shows and all of that, it's just, like, so easy. Just get rid of it. But it's not, right? The more that people address that deeper root of the clutter, the easier it is to release the clutter. TAGLE: In this episode of LIFE KIT, the art of decluttering. We'll talk with Star about how to find the root of those emotional attachments to your stuff, tips for letting go and strategies for creating intentional clutter-free spaces that stick. Star, in every place I've lived, no matter how organized I am, no matter how big or small the space, no matter, you know, what good intentions I go in with it with, I always, always end up with a junk drawer. You know, it starts as the utility drawer - you know, batteries, that spare thing of scissors, tape, things like that. And then inevitably, it just gets away from me - every takeout menu, a catchall for my condiment packets or just, you know, napkins. You get the picture. I don't need to go on. But it's a habit that I just can't seem to shake, and it haunts me. What might that clutter be saying to you? HANSEN: Well, let's dive into the superficial level first, which is just we're busy and it's not a priority. Like, would you rather get rest, sleep eight hours tonight, or clear your junk drawer? Would you rather, you know, cuddle with your puppy or clear your junk drawer? Like, it's just not a high-priority activity. So that's part of it. So we just want to name that and let it be OK. That ideally stops us from feeling that shame and guilt build up. The second part is - the junk drawer is a great example of an unhoused, you know, graveyard basically. So, like, where do the things go that don't have a home? TAGLE: Yeah. HANSEN: And generally speaking, it's because we're not quite sure of like, oh, I don't know, do I want that? You know, I might need that extra silverware set from takeout. TAGLE: And then never, ever use them. HANSEN: Totally. And also, too, you're bumping up against those feelings that we have in a disposable, consumer-driven society, which is what a waste. What a waste of that tree that created the chopsticks. What a waste of the plastic that's housing the chopsticks. So we're not just dealing with clutter, we're looking at our value system. So you holding on to those chopsticks is you saying, I don't want to waste on our beautiful, precious planet. And it's really complicated because we live in a world where to not accumulate excess requires a next level veracity of, like, saying no. And then we wonder why we're all kind of drowning in stuff. We have so much thrown at us all the time. TAGLE: What about if you live with someone who has a very different clutter personality than you? So, for example, I tend towards maximalism when it comes to decor. My partner is very much team clean, open spaces. HANSEN: So what's really important is you want to make sure that you all have established your safe spaces. So - and when I say safe spaces, I just mean, where are you allowed to clutter? Because every person should be able to behave with their stuff the way that they naturally need to and want to because sometimes people need and want a chaotic energy around them. If you look at artists, have you ever walked into an artist's studio that was, like, perfectly organized and minimalist? TAGLE: Yeah, it's not clutter. It's creative chaos. HANSEN: Totally. I have a client who's neurodivergent, and she thrives in having her clothes everywhere. And her husband has been diagnosed with OCD, and he can't tolerate it. So they have to create different corners of the house that are for them. Then you want to come together and say, OK, great, consciously, what are we choosing for this room? What are the rules and guidelines for this room? And this is tricky because a lot of times, we move into the house and we are just, you know, hobbling over that finish line, dragging ourselves by one fingernail to cross. And we barely have energy to unpack boxes, let alone set up intentions... TAGLE: Right. HANSEN: ...And set up rules for, you know, life. So it's really important that you take the time. It doesn't matter if you moved in five years ago or five days ago, taking the time to say, wow, I'm noticing that we are having some incongruence in this room. Can we get on the same page? Because one of the things that's really important is for some people, clutter is not something you're going to just eliminate. You're not going to suddenly become a minimalist. And what we want to do is stop judging people who experience clutter in their lives and who it's part of how they process. TAGLE: That's great. What I'm hearing there, just, like, in many other facets of relationships, is that there's going to be some compromises, and everyone needs their own space, too. Is clutter a problem if it doesn't bother you? Does clutter only become a problem when it bothers you? HANSEN: It is only a problem if it's a problem for you. And it's really important that we mind our own side of the street because, again, you don't know what someone is going through. It sounds like I'm very pro-clutter, and in some ways I am. It is OK to have your clutter. It is OK to have a layer of chaos and disorganization in your life. If we can be OK with that, it allows us to stop the shame, stop the judgment, start to see what the root of it is so we can actually have a chance of letting it go. As long as we're judging and shaming and attacking ourselves, that clutter is going to hold tight because we need it, you know, to, like, protect ourselves. But the minute that you can say no, you know, it's OK that it's here, and no thank you to your opinion very much, this is how I'm living my life, and it's my journey and I'm going to walk it on my own - that's a much stronger position for you to be in because then the clutter is your choice. TAGLE: We're adults, and we get to make the rules. HANSEN: Exactly. Exactly. TAGLE: I'd love to move into the practical a little bit. Any specific tips for making incremental progress on your clutter? HANSEN: So when it comes to home organizing, you do really want to start in the easiest place first. I don't recommend starting with the most emotional things or paperwork - you know, memorabilia and paperwork are two things that I say, please save that for further down the line because those two tend to be the most emotionally triggering. We are looking at organizing as creating a skill set. Like, most people, if they have recurring clutter, do not feel like they have a handle on the process of organizing. And so you don't want to start, you know, with the most difficult thing first. Like, if you were going to go for a run, you're not going to choose to run the Big Sur marathon at a... TAGLE: Sure. Lifting weights - you go with five pounds before 10 pounds HANSEN: You, like, ease in, yeah. But then the other thing is when we look at how the mainstream world talks about organizing, they're talking about creating systems. They're talking about putting things in a pretty box with a label and giving it a home, right? And oftentimes, they're also talking about letting go of things. So in my experience, those are two very small pieces of a much bigger puzzle. When it comes to getting organized, if you're only trying to do those two things - getting rid of things or setting up systems. You are missing a lot of other really important stuff that creates organization and maintains organization. TAGLE: Star says she's big about setting an intention for a space. So look around that messy office or living room and think... HANSEN: What is it that I want to do in this room? How do I want it to feel? And, you know, what do I want it to look like? How do I know what to keep and get rid of? TAGLE: For me, it's the bedroom. I store a lot of my clothes under my bed. To be fair to me, my apartment is super short on storage. But also, I have a really hard time letting go of clothes. And they can sometimes take over our bedroom entirely. Star says to help, start thinking about three to five activities you want to do in the room. HANSEN: You're going to sleep. You're going to store clothes. You're going to connect with your partner, right? Those are maybe three things that we would say in that space. And we would pull all the clothes out. And I always tell people, don't make decisions as you go. What you want to do is you want to look at your stuff with neutral eyes, like as though you're helping a friend and none of your stuff means anything to you. TAGLE: OK. HANSEN: Just pull them all out, and then you want to put them into categories in a clear, neutral space. So, like, say, on top of the bed. So what you want to do is all jeans go here. All T-shirts go here. All socks go here. So you categorize everything all together. Then, once you've pulled everything out and it's all in categories, then you want to go through each pile and make a decision. Does this stay or go, stay or go? That's what we're kind of looking for, right? And then once you've gone through all the piles, one pile at a time - and we're looking at doing that the easiest to the hardest. So if you're like, oh, jeans are my kryptonite, save that for the end. Socks - I need to get rid of socks. Start there. Whatever's easy, start there. Go through each pile. And then once you're done going through everything, you want to take all those things that you're going to get rid of and get them out right then because you want to give yourself that openness, that freedom, that space to think. As long as you're looking at things you already made the decision to get rid of, you're kind of keeping yourself stuck in the past. So get it to the car to be donated or by the door. TAGLE: Physically move it out of that space. HANSEN: Yeah, get it out of there. And then you want to go through each pile and you want to say, OK, where am I going to store this? That's when we're talking about building systems. OK, great. Well, I want all my T-shirts hung, so you hang your T-shirts. I want all of the jeans folded and put into this bin underneath my bed. Fold it, put it underneath there, label it on all four sides, shove it under there. You're going to go through each category in that way. When we look at the concept of clutter as a whole, it's like one giant blob of chaos versus, oh, what am I going to do with my jeans? What am I going to do with my tank tops? And it becomes easier to dial in to. TAGLE: Once you found a home for everything, Star says it's time to personalize your space and make it beautiful. HANSEN: If you put some things in the closet, for example, do you want to paint the wall green? Do you want to hang a painting from your aunt? What do you want in there that reminds you of you and makes you feel happy? Because no one wants to live in a surplus store, you know? We want to feel personal. So what you want is that when you open that door, when you go underneath the bed, there's something that just makes you feel happy and peaceful and recognize yourself. Because when you decorate or when you kind of personalize a space, it stops you from adding more clutter. There's something about it that we won't kind of defile an area if we feel an endearment to it. And then from there, you want to decide, what's your maintenance plan, right? So it's pretty. It's set up. Now how am I going to maintain this? What I always tell people is make your maintenance systems for your laziest day. We all are superheroes when we are well-rested and, like, feeling good. And the truth is what happens when you come home from traveling? What happens when you get the flu? Those are the moments where we really lose our systems because suddenly we've gotten lost because things didn't go according to plan. TAGLE: It makes sense to me that, you know, when things are pretty, when they feel good, it's easier to have that investment and hopefully a long term investment, right? You want to give yourself the ability to invest in these things. But on that note, there are a lot of - there's a lot of beautiful and also very expensive ways to get organized these days. You know, I'm thinking about Instagram ads very aesthetic containers and all the videos I see for people's immaculate walk-in pantries? Does decluttering have to come with a price tag? HANSEN: What I have found in all my years of organizing is in every pile of chaos is the solution, meaning that when I come into somebody's house and we're organizing an entire room, yes, I could go and buy bins and boxes, but I have never not found the organizing solution buried in the chaos. We all have bought boxes over the years that then become clutter or, you know, things that we had best intentions with. So, yes, look, the organizing industry is a $12 billion a year industry and growing, right? It's just getting bigger and bigger. So it's an industry, just like anything else, and it wants you to spend money and do all of that. For some people, they really, really want that. You do not need to do that, right? A lot of these systems are hidden. A lot of these systems, you are never going to look out again, you know? And so what you're looking for is function more than anything else. I promise you, there is something in your house that you can use for that, even if it's, like, a box from your iPhone that you're not using anymore. But the quality is so good you don't want to get rid of. TAGLE: I have so many of those. HANSEN: Totally. Well, they make... TAGLE: (Laughter). HANSEN: ...They're so good, and they make great, like, drawer organizers. You just take those little inserts out, put them in the drawers. They're amazing. They'll last forever. So just knowing that you have this option to shop from within your own home is really powerful. And it's really important to take the time to create systems that work for you and how you really think. TAGLE: Yeah. It's not a one size fits all. This is up to you and how you want to do it, so make it fun. Make it fun where you can. What about decluttering tips for small spaces, or maybe storage ideas for small spaces? HANSEN: So the smaller your space, the more intentional you have to be. You might want to really lean in and have, like, oh, I want to keep this and this and this. But if you're in a small space, you have to have those three questions that I asked you really dialed in. What are the three to five activities you want to do in the space, how do you want it to look and how do you want to feel? You need to live from that like it's your Bible, like nothing exists in that space that isn't in alignment with those values because you just don't have the space for it. And it's really vital that we say, this is my intention and I'm moving forward. So when it comes to those spaces, you want to - yes, of course - like, have things that are multi-functional. Maximize the vertical space of your home. You know, organize and hang things on walls and in closets and really do as much dual functionality as you can. Also, see what you can get away with when it comes to multi-use items. TAGLE: Sure. That makes sense. So just really taking the time to be thoughtful about it. Maybe you have a couch that you'd really like to keep so that you don't have to buy a new couch. But if you have to walk diagonal in your studio apartment all the time, then it's not going to do you much good. HANSEN: Yeah. And, you know, we live in this wonderful time where you don't have to buy things all the time. There's infinite options for how you can source things without spending a lot of money. So I'm not saying go and spend a million dollars, but what I'm saying is get clear about what the right solution is. Stop living with the version that doesn't work for you. When you're in small spaces, you don't have the luxury of holding on to something because it's good enough or it used to work. You've got to be very sharp and clear about how you're going to use those spaces and map them out and then find the right things. And it might take time, but that's really, really vital in small spaces. TAGLE: I want to touch a little bit on relief versus completion. When you're tackling big projects or when you're just in the middle of it and you can't see your way through, can you talk to us a little bit about how to avoid overwhelms and some tips or strategies for - you know, for staying on top of it and not losing the thread? HANSEN: Absolutely. You can say, I'm not going to be in servitude to this clutter. I am choosing to take X amount of time to devote to clearing this clutter. So instead of saying, I'm going to take as long as this clutter takes to get organized - because the truth is, you could spend five hours on a pile of clutter, 20 minutes on a pile of clutter or five days on a pile of clutter, and you get to determine how long. So you could say, I'm willing to give this one hour. And in one hour, you just make it better. You don't have to get it completed fully, all the way done, because that's a moving target. You can just say, I'm willing to give this an hour and really give yourself that hour, and do the best that you can. Like, sometimes getting organized is not about this thorough, down-to-the-needle, you know, process. Sometimes it's just, I just need to walk in this room. And so that might look like you just walking through with a garbage bag and grabbing everything that's trash that you can see with your eye, or the same with donations. Or saying, I only have an hour, but I need to walk in this room and boxing things up and stacking it so that it gives you a breezeway, like, a real walkway. And so you really have to notice, like, OK, what is it that I need from this process right now? What kind of resources am I able to devote to it? Because again, we have this idea that we're supposed to, like, get it all done. And it's like, that's not always the case. And what if that's OK? What if this is you accomplishing something very big in small, manageable steps? What if that's enough? And I promise you it is, because it's not - the people who stay organized are not the ones who go and get the house renovation and do the whole thing in one weekend. That leads to backsliding, oftentimes. It's the people who stay consistent and keep moving through, a step at a time. Those are the people who really experience long-term organization. So just keep moving forward. That's the most important thing. TAGLE: That was Star Hansen, a professional organizer, also known as the Clutter Whisperer. By the way, Happy New Year.

Republicans – and Democrats who don't fight back \n         By Stephen Fowler \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 3:17 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         For people who don't like the Trump administration's policies or how the Democratic Party has responded, there's a good chance  I've Had It  has come across their social media feeds. It only takes a few seconds of listening to get a sense of who hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie \"Pumps\" Sullivan consider their target audience — and the target of their ire. \"Patriots, Gaytriots, Theytriots, Blacktriots, Browntriots and to all the crusty motherf****** that don't support them, you can f*** off,\" one recent episode began. Welch is an interior designer. Sullivan, an attorney. They're two middle-aged suburban women from Oklahoma — and one-time Bravo reality TV stars — whose show has come to represent a vocal coalition of a liberal base who has, well, had it, with Democrats. \"It feels like the 'Preservation Party,' that they want to preserve the status quo,\" Welch said in an interview. \"It almost feels conservative in the sense that they are not evolving and they are not moving.\" Speaking to NPR at the end of October, Welch and Sullivan talked about the show's rising popularity and the Democratic Party's unpopularity among voters who say its leaders don't fight against President Trump enough. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, they're writing strongly worded letters and it's like, this guy's tearing down democracy,\" Sullivan said of the House and Senate Democratic leaders. \"We need more action than we need strongly worded letters.\" The two hosts have different backgrounds — Welch is a lifelong liberal atheist who's always been outspoken and just moved to New York City for a spell, while Sullivan was raised as a conservative evangelical Christian who has slowly become more comfortable with sharing her political views. Both say that key Democratic Party leaders are not doing enough to stand up for marginalized groups, to support young and progressive candidates like mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City, or to push back against Trump policies. One of those recent moments on display was with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was asked about Israel's war in Gaza. More specifically, he was asked if he thought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"a war criminal,\" allegations that Netanyahu has rejected. \"These are questions that a lot of people think are the important litmus tests that are loaded and hot,\" Booker said, visibly flustered. \"My urgency is to be an effective leader in bringing an end to this crisis. And I get these questions all the time that, to me, undermine my urgency.\" The same senator who spoke for 25 hours on the floor in April to protest the Trump administration, Welch said, filibustered what should be a simple yes or no question. \"The thing with Cory Booker is, I can disagree with him if he's f***** honest,\" Welch said of the interaction. \"But to give us a chicken**** cowardice answer about 'Is Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal?' The answer to that is objectively yes.\" Her answer illustrates another reason some folks can't get enough of I've Had It: a brand of raw, unvarnished and often impolite descriptions of American politics right now. In an episode called \"America's Dumbass Dictator\" that premiered on Election Day last week, Sullivan bemoaned what she called the \"propaganda machine of MAGA\" around the suggestion that Trump could illegally run for a third term. \"I feel like we've gone from either you're on the side of legality, the Constitution and democracy, or you're full-blown fascist and you don't give a s***,\" she said. Welch says the podcast's tone is just how people talk: \"a little bit of gossip, a little bit of policy, a little bit of 'F yous'... it's more digestible, it's more interesting that way.\" She also points to Trump's new media successes and how he makes politics more conversational. \"I disagree with everything he says, I think he's a compulsive liar, etcetera… but the way we talk is really the way Trump has been doing it the last ten years on podcasts,\" Welch said. Sullivan adds that the duo's self-deprecating humor is key. \"I do think that since we don't take ourselves so seriously — like so many politicians — it makes us more like just a gal pal that you're running around with,\" she said. Online, clips from the show have gone viral for their salty language and pejorative descriptions of Trump, Vice President Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans. But it's their withering rebukes of Democratic Party leaders — sometimes to their faces — that have also helped the duo gain millions of followers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more. \"Hakeem and Chuckles – that's what we call Chuck Schumer – and the Cory Bookers of the Democratic Party, if they don't get their s*** together, a grifter much like Donald Trump will come in and fill that void,\" Welch said. The twice-a-week \"I've Had It\" and its shorter twice-a-day news counterpart \"IHIP News\" find themselves on top podcast charts next to shows like the Rachel Maddow Show and the Charlie Kirk Show, amassing hundreds of thousands of views and listens a week across mediums. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We have all age groups, red states, blue states, rural areas, big cities,\" Welch added, when asked about who is consuming their content. \"What is so interesting about us is that we're middle-aged women from a red state, and it's like, 'Oh my God, white people do care! Also, the fact that we're novel — that, I think, is kinda sad.\" At a time when the political podcasting space is dominated by the manosphere and a search for the \"Joe Rogan of the Left\" to bring voters back to the Democratic Party, the \"I've Had It\" hosts say their show is trying to nudge elected officials back towards the voters. \"I'm cautious to have the mentality that a lot of leftists do: 'Let's just burn it all down, it's the only way we're going to get better,'\" Welch said. \"I say, let's confront and push the politicians we have as far as we can. And if that makes them both vulnerable to primary, then they weren't the right leader for us anyway.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   \"I've Had It\" - that's a podcast hosted by Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, and it has become a go-to listen for voters who do not like the Trump administration's policies, nor how the Democratic Party leadership has responded. NPR's Stephen Fowler has this look at why this show hosted by two liberal women is climbing the charts. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: In just one sentence that comes at the start of most episodes, host Jennifer Welch and Angie Pumps Sullivan succinctly summarize their target audience and the target of their ire. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"I'VE HAD IT\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Patriots, gaytriots, theytriots, blacktriots, browntriots, and to all of the crusty [expletive] that don't support them, you can [expletive] off. FOWLER: They are two middle-aged suburban women from Oklahoma, they're one-time Bravo reality TV stars, and they have a podcast that has come to represent a vocal coalition of a liberal base who has, well, had it with Democrats. JENNIFER WELCH: It feels like the preservation party - that they want to preserve the status quo. It almost feels conservative in the sense that they are not evolving and they are not moving. FOWLER: In an interview with NPR at the end of October, Welch and Sullivan talked about the show's rising popularity and the Democratic Party's unpopularity among voters who say they don't fight against Trump enough. Here's Sullivan. ANGIE SULLIVAN: You know, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, they're writing strongly worded letters. And it's like, this guy's tearing down democracy. We need more action than we need strongly worded letters. FOWLER: A recent clip of their interview with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is a good example of that dynamic. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"I'VE HAD IT\") WELCH: Benjamin Netanyahu - do you think he's a war criminal? CORY BOOKER: I - again, these are questions that a lot of people think are the important litmus tests that are loaded and hot. FOWLER: The same senator who spoke for 25 hours on the floor in April to protest the Trump administration also filibustered what Welch said should be a simple yes or no answer. WELCH: The thing with Cory Booker is I can disagree with him if he's [expletive] honest. If he's honest. But to give us a [expletive] cowardice answer about is Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal? The answer to that is objectively yes. It is objectively yes. FOWLER: For his part, Netanyahu rejects allegations that he's committed war crimes. Welch's response, though, illustrates another reason some folks can't get enough of the \"I've Had It\" show - a brand of raw, unvarnished and often impolite descriptions of American politics right now. SULLIVAN: I just feel like we've gone from either on - you're on the side of legality, the Constitution and democracy or you're a full-blown fascist and you don't give a [expletive]. FOWLER: Excerpts from the show regularly go viral online for their pejorative descriptions of Trump, Vice President Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans, many of which you can't say on the radio. Welch says that's just how people talk. And Sullivan? SULLIVAN: But I also think that we're funny the way we talk with each other, and we're self-deprecating. And I do think that since we don't take ourselves so seriously, like so many politicians, it makes us more like just a gal pal that you're running around with. FOWLER: At a time when the political pod space is dominated by the manosphere and a search for the, quote, \"Joe Rogan of the left\" to bring voters back to the Democratic Party, Welch says their shows are trying to nudge elected officials back towards the voters. WELCH: I'm cautious to have the mentality that a lot of leftists do - let's just burn it all down. It's the only way we're going to get better. I say let's confront and push the politicians we have as far as we can. FOWLER: The twice-a-week \"I've Had It\" and its shorter twice-a-day news counterpart \"IHIP News\" regularly find themselves near the top of podcast charts, next to things like \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" and \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" where they amass hundreds of thousands of views a week and boast millions of followers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more.

Over the past six months, Trump has suggested or ordered mobilizing Guard troops to nearly a dozen cities — all run by Democratic mayors and in states mostly run by Democratic governors. The Trump administration has argued the move was necessary to reduce crime, quell protests, or safeguard federal buildings and personnel. Meanwhile, critics have called it a  dangerous abuse of power . The troop deployments have sparked court battles and protests. Here's the latest. Oregon: Stalled in court  After weeks of legal wrangling, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut on Nov. 7 issued a permanent block against sending troops to Portland over anti-ICE protests. In her order, Immergut wrote that federal action was not justified for the demonstrations in Portland, which she described as mostly peaceful or quickly managed by local law enforcement. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling,  member station OPB reported. The Trump administration on Sept. 28 activated  200 members of the Oregon National Guard  for federal duty following protests near an ICE facility in Portland. Oregon and Portland officials sued the Trump administration and later, Immergut granted a temporary restraining order blocking a troop deployment. A week later, the Trump administration attempted to send the California National Guard to Portland without the approval of California's governor. Immergut temporarily blocked that move ahead of a trial, which began on Oct. 29 and lasted three days. Illinois: Stalled in court  Guard operations in Chicago have been on hold following a temporary restraining order issued last month. Now all eyes are on the nation's highest court, which the Trump administration has asked to lift the court order blocking the troop deployment. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the emergency appeal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mobilized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago on Oct. 4. About 200 members of the Texas National Guard were also deployed, according to the  U.S. military's Northern Command . Troops were assigned to protect ICE facilities and personnel, as well as other federal property. In response, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago  filed a lawsuit  against the Trump administration, alleging that the troop deployment was unlawful. T ennessee: Ongoing In mid-October, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit in state court against Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, arguing that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion of invasion\" which is the standard for deploying the Tennessee National Guard under the state's constitution. A court hearing on the suit took place on Nov. 3. The case is ongoing. Troops were activated by Lee, with support from Trump, as part of an effort to tackle crime in Memphis. Guard members are part of a task force that includes other federal agencies and they began patrols  on Oct. 10 . Lee previously said troops are in support roles and not tasked with making arrests. Last month, Memphis Democratic mayor Paul Young  said  there were about 150 Guard troops deployed in the city. Although Young has previously questioned the use of the Guard in Memphis, he was not part of the lawsuit against the deployment. Back in September, the Memphis City Council failed to pass a resolution to formally ask the state to not send the Guard. Washington, D.C.: Ongoing About 2,300 troops from D.C. and several states are stationed in the nation's capital. Soldiers are largely tasked with patrols and beautification efforts like clearing trash, spreading mulch and pruning trees. Troops will remain in the nation's capital through the end of February, The Associated Press  reported . Trump sent hundreds of Guard members to D.C. on Aug. 11 alleging that the city is experiencing a \"crime emergency.\" The District of Columbia sued over the troop deployment, accusing the Trump administration of violating the Home Rule Act by mobilizing troops to D.C. without the mayor's consent. A federal judge heard arguments on Oct. 24 and did not make a ruling from the bench. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The use of troops in D.C. has also been challenged in a state that sent them. In West Virginia, a civic organization filed a lawsuit against the state's governor, arguing that the situation in D.C. did not meet the criteria to deploy the West Virginia National Guard. On Nov. 10, a judge in West Virginia ruled that the deployment can continue, according to The  Associated Press . California: Ongoing but reduced presence  On June 7, Trump mobilized the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration raids in the city — some of which had turned into  clashes with local police . In total, some 4,000 guard troops and 700 Marines were deployed. The Pentagon began withdrawing troops in mid-July. A  legal battle  has since ensued, with the state of California accusing the Trump administration of exceeding its legal authority by deploying troops without the consent or input of the state's governor. About 100 guard members remain in California for federal service, according to the U.S. Northern Command. Next possible cities Over the past few months, Trump has suggested sending troops to a handful of more cities, including New Orleans, New York City, Baltimore, San Francisco, Oakland and St. Louis, Mo., citing public safety concerns. \"We want to save these places,\" Trump said on Sept. 15 after announcing the creation of the anti-crime federal task force in Memphis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some Republican-led states have welcomed the support. Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe authorized about 15 members of his state's National Guard to help ICE with \"administrative, clerical, and logistical duties,\" member station STLPR  reported . The move came at the request of the Department of Homeland Security and the mission is set to last through September 2026. In Louisiana, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry  requested  federal assistance to activate up to 1,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard to combat \"high crime rates\" — not just in New Orleans, but also in Shreveport and Baton Rouge.

If your car falls into a body of water? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hector Carias, an officer with the California Highway Patrol, explains what to do in these emergency situations. The key is to stay vigilant, he says. \"Driving should take 100% of your concentration, 100% of the time. Being defensive behind the vehicle can only bring positive outcomes.\" Motor vehicle crashes are  a leading cause of death  in the United States, killing more than 120 people everyday, according to 2022 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But they are preventable. Carias, who works out of CHP's Central Division office in Fresno, Calif., shares his top road safety do's and don'ts. 1. DON'T speed.  It can make it harder to avoid potential hazards on the road, and it can make car crashes more severe, Carias says. If someone is tailgating you, \"move over one lane and let them pass. There's no reason for you to speed up.\" 2. DO call 911 if you're being threatened by another driver . \"If someone is brandishing a firearm or a car has been following you, contact 911,\" Carias says. Don't engage. Officers will send help. If they can't get to your location on the highway, \"Don't stop. Our dispatch will stay on the phone with you and give you directions to a designated location, where an officer will try to meet you.\"  3. DON'T slam the brakes if you have engine trouble on the highway.  If your car stalls or runs out of gas on the road, put your hazard lights on right away and release the accelerator, Carias says. \"Try to veer to the right shoulder of the freeway and come to a safe stop,\" then call roadside assistance or 911.  4. DO hop into the passenger seat while waiting for help in the right shoulder lane.  It can be safer than sitting in the driver's seat. You want to position yourself as far away from traffic as possible. And buckle up, Carias says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       5. DO get as far away from your car as possible if you see smoke or flames coming out of the engine.  In the event of a car fire, pull over, turn off the engine and move yourself at least 100 feet away from the burning vehicle,  according to  the U.S. Fire Administration. Don't try to fight the fire. 6. DO slow down in extreme rainy conditions.  \"Give yourself more time to be reactive\" to road hazards, Carias says. And turn on your headlights.   Rain can make it hard to see the road and for other drivers to see you. \"I have a little saying that goes, 'if your wipers are going, your headlights are glowing.'\" 7. DON'T accelerate or slam the brakes if you're skidding on ice.  \"Once you've already started sliding, you're kind of going along for the ride,\" Carias says. Cautiously turn your wheel in the direction you want the car to go, and straighten the wheel as you feel the car straighten out,  according to AAA . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       8. DON'T turn on your high beams in heavy fog.  \"Fog is essentially water molecules. Shining bright light at those molecules is just going to reflect that light back to you and make it harder to see,\" Carias says. Instead, turn on your headlights and fog lamps if you have them. 9. DO unbuckle your seatbelt and start to roll down the windows the moment your car falls into a body of water.  \"Don't try to open the door,\" Carias says. Once a vehicle is more fully submerged, the pressure from the water against the windows and doors  can make it difficult to open them .  Escape through the open window and exit to safety. If you can't roll down the window, \"do your best to shatter the window using your elbow or whatever you can,\" Carias says. For peace of mind, purchase a window punch to keep in your car. 10. DO keep emergency supplies in your car.  That includes a first aid kit, water, jumper cables, a flashlight and blankets, Carias says. AAA  also recommends  keeping a basic set of tools and road flares or reflectors.  This episode was produced by Margaret Cirino. The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane.

 Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KYIV and KHARKIV, Ukraine — Maryna Mytsiuk spends her free time at a shooting range outside Kyiv, hyper-focused on hitting her targets. She's got to practice. She's waiting for a call that, any day, will send her to war. \"Of course, I'd like to be in a combat position,\" said Mytsiuk, a 27-year-old folklore scholar who speaks Japanese and works at a nonprofit. \"With my build and height, I'm not a natural fit for that … so I'm training very hard.\" She is among a growing number of Ukrainian women joining the military as Russia's full-scale war on the country nears its fourth year, and troops remain in short supply. This comes as an end to the fighting appears no closer than it was when President Trump took office in January vowing to quickly broker peace. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Mytsiuk said the Ukrainian military has become much more receptive to women since the early days of the full-scale invasion, when Ukrainian men were lining up at recruitment centers to become soldiers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She wanted to sign up, too, but was told she would be best off in the kitchen, she said, \"where I could make dumplings.\" Mytsiuk, however, plowed ahead. She enrolled at a military university for a second degree, graduating this summer. She looked into several brigades and applied to those with special forces units. She had difficult conversations with her mother and her boyfriend, a soldier. Both strongly oppose her decision. \"I see women my age getting married, having children,\" she said. \"I can't help having thoughts, like am I doing the right thing? But there's no turning back now.\" Sooner or later, she said, she believes everyone in Ukraine who is able to will have to fight, especially with no ceasefire deal on the horizon. Soldiers by choice Men between the ages of 25 and 60 can be drafted in Ukraine, but women are exempt. \"We are volunteers choosing to fight,\" Mytsiuk says. Ukraine's military  says  more than 70,000 women were serving in the country's armed forces as of January. Oksana Hryhorieva, the military's gender adviser, says though that's only about 8% of the country's total armed forces, the number of women has risen 40% since 2021. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Until parliament passed a 2018 law,\" she said, \"the military was patriarchal, and women were not legally allowed to serve in combat positions or study all disciplines at military universities.\" Women who joined battalions when Russia invaded parts of eastern and southern Ukraine in 2014 did fight on the front line but were classified as noncombatants. \"For example,\" Hryhorieva said, \"we had biathletes who were great snipers, but according to their documents, they were cooks. It was totally unfair.\" Now, she says, women make up about 20% of military cadets and thousands are officially serving in combat positions. They include  fighter pilots ,  artillery commanders , drone operators and engineers. NPR met several women serving in various military units this year. Some brigades, including Khartiia and Azov, which are both part of Ukraine's National Guard, feature women in their advertising campaigns. In one popular Azov  recruitment video  released this summer, two dads in a car shop talk about their kids. One says his son is trying to find a job at a critical enterprise to exempt him from military service. The other says he has a daughter — and she's a soldier. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Khartiia 13th National Guard Brigade,  founded  by a Ukrainian billionaire in early 2022 as a volunteer battalion, is based in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. It's well-resourced and an innovator in robotic warfare.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This spring, the brigade launched a female-centered recruitment campaign  featuring  a soldier in the ground robotic systems division named Jess. She is shown on a field, a white ribbon tying back her red hair, testing land drones that are used to deliver water, food, fuel and ammunition to soldiers in front-line positions. \"I am the only woman in this unit,\" she says. \"I am 21 years old.\" The drone operators \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a Khartiia camp in northeastern Ukraine earlier this year, two drone pilots — Yevheniia and Dasha — examined newly assembled first-person view (FPV) drones at a small hut with a 3D printer. The scent of shorn wood, metal and instant coffee wafts through the air. NPR is using only the drone pilots' first names and call signs at the request of the Ukrainian military, which cited security concerns. Yevhenia, 19, resembles Arya Stark from  Game of Thrones . She uses the military call sign \"Furia,\" after the ancient Greco-Roman goddesses who punished evildoers for their sins. She said male soldiers often ask her: What are you doing here? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"And I say, I have to be here, and that's that,\" she said. \"And why drones?\" she added. \"I think because I love to play computer games.\" She and Dasha were among three women in an FPV drone unit of 15. Dasha, 23, is tall and stern. She uses the call sign \"Galactica.\" She was briefly married and, before the war, was making plans to become a police officer. Dasha said her mother wept when she left for basic training. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"My mother wanted me to stay at home, be a wife, have children,\" Dasha said. \"And I chose what she calls a man's profession, living with a constant threat on my life.\" Another drone operator in the unit is in a muddy field a short drive from camp. Daria is a former software engineer in her early 30s. She is testing a new aerial drone as the sun sets. \"A lot of my relatives don't even know I'm here,\" she said. \"They say, 'She needs to go to Europe and be in some safe place.'\" Daria volunteered as a humanitarian worker in the early days of the full-scale invasion, working 20 hours a day shuttling food and other supplies to front-line areas. She never felt like she was doing enough. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'm Ukrainian, I'm a part of this country, and I need to help,\" she said. She learned how to assemble and fly first-person-view drones, which are outfitted with video cameras and guidance systems controlled remotely. Some brigades told her there weren't many jobs for \"girls\" but Khartiia welcomed her drone skills. \"Here,\" she said, \"they knew what to do with me.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She said she has lost touch with many friends since joining the military. Male friends have fled the country to avoid the draft. She said she has struggled not to judge them. \"It's their choice,\" she said, frowning. \"They can do what they want to do. I can't say, 'Everybody needs to be like me.' Though I want [to], honestly.\" The medic Earlier this year in the city of Sumy, also in northeastern Ukraine, a combat medic who had just left the front line walked into a beauty salon. Olena Ivanenko, who goes by the call sign \"Ryzh,\" was exhausted. She slumped in a plush chair, then closed her eyes as a beautician shaped her eyebrows, then polished her nails. \"I know that in three days my nails will be grimy again,\" she said. \"But looking at clean nails for one day gives me such relief and pleasure. For me, it's as routine as breakfast.\" Ryzh is 44 and ran restaurants before joining the military in 2023. She was with the 47th Mechanized Brigade before joining 412 Nemesis, a brigade in Ukraine's unmanned systems, this year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I decided after three months of service that I would stay in the army forever,\" she said. \"I will not return to civilian life. I feel very comfortable here. I feel like I am 100,000, million percent in my place.\" Her service has also brought considerable heartbreak. She calls them \"the dark dates.\" In one battle in 2023, many in her unit died, including one of her closest friends. \"He was the first to get blown up,\" she said, \"and I pulled him out of the dugout. This is probably the hardest thing for me in the whole war so far.\" Ryzh herself was wounded in the leg after a Russian tank fired at her. (She has since recovered.) She said she speaks a lot to civilians about what soldiers face on the front line. She has noticed the divide between soldiers and civilians growing. \"Soldiers say we are working for victory, and civilians say we want peace,\" she said. \"But peace and victory are different things.\" The military intelligence analyst At a Kyiv exhibition hall this spring, Ukraine's military intelligence unveiled state-of-the-art sea drones — and three members of the elite unit that operate them. A  Ukrainian cover  of the song \"Sonne\" by the German gothic metal band Rammstein blared as the soldiers strode onto the stage. They appeared in disguise, in balaclavas and sunglasses. When they spoke through microphones, their voices were distorted for security reasons. One was Xena, like the warrior-princess of the 1990s TV series. A version of these sea drones, equipped with rockets and machine guns,  downed  a Russian fighter jet in the Black Sea earlier this year. \"Our challenge,\" Xena said, \"is to lure the Russians out of their bases and then hunt them. We intend to keep adapting these sea drones until we can target and hit Russian fighter jets, helicopters and ships under any conditions.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Xena has been a military analyst for a decade and joined this elite unit after the full-scale invasion, which has fueled a rapid innovation of weapons in Ukraine. She said she's used to being the only woman on her team. \"And it's not easy,\" she said. \"I do feel support from my guys, but sometimes they can act like kids, you know? They see my support role as bringing them cookies or tea — or something like that.\" She laughed into her balaclava and said she has more important things to worry about, like staying alive. \"Motivation helps,\" she said. \"Motivation to win this war.\" A death, and a new life In early September, a large crowd filled St. Michael's domed cathedral in Kyiv for a soldier's funeral. As a military band played, pallbearers carried out the coffin past mourners kneeling in respect. The family clutched a framed portrait of the fallen soldier: a smiling young woman with wire-rimmed glasses. Daria Lopatina, 19, was an engineer with the special forces of the Azov brigade. She had dropped out of the Kyiv School of Economics to defend Ukraine. Saluting her coffin was Ruslan Shelar, who works at the Defense Ministry with Lopatina's father. Shelar said he has noticed more women enlisting, especially those under 25. He points out Lopatina was 8 years old when Russia backed paramilitaries to seize parts of eastern Ukraine and illegally annex Crimea in 2014 — before the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. \"She grew up with war,\" he said, \"surrounded by people who had taken part in it. Her path was set.\" Ukraine's armed forces do not disclose Ukrainian casualty figures, so it's unclear how many female soldiers have died. The stakes are clear to Maryna Mytsiuk, the new recruit in Kyiv waiting for her military assignment. \"I constantly think about it, about death,\" she said. \"But it's better to die on the battlefield than from a missile hitting your apartment in Kyiv. Better to die fighting than die on your knees.\" Olena Lysenko and Hanna Palamarenko contributed reporting from Kyiv. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604681","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:04:00-04:00","title":"Trump floats tariff 'dividends' even while plan shows major flaws","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed a $2,000 'dividend' for middle- and lower-income Americans, claiming it would return tariff revenue to taxpayers and help lower national debt.

Over the weekend, Trump  pushed the idea  of paying that money back to Americans, in the form of $2,000 payments. The idea is in no way a detailed proposal, but what Trump has said about it presents multiple steep challenges for the administration: the plan may cost far more than Trump is saying, and Trump's rhetoric around tariff revenue may undermine his administration's pro-tariff arguments at the Supreme Court. In addition, his administration is already saying that the plan won't even involve direct payments to taxpayers, even while Trump continues to push that notion. Trump summarized much of what he's said about his tariff rebate plan speaking with reporters on Monday. \"We're going to issue a dividend to our middle income people and lower income people of about $2,000,\" he said. \"And we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt.\" While details are scant,  budget experts  are  already saying  that there just isn't enough money for this idea. \"Even with the most conservative estimates applied to it, it doesn't work,\" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. By her math, if the rebates went to people making under $100,000 per year, that would cost way more than the amount of revenue tariffs will bring in. \"So you'll see at least a $100 billion gap there between what we can expect the tariffs to generate for the U.S. government versus what the president is promising to spend on tariff rebates for American citizens.\" She added that even if the money went out only to people making $75,000 or less annually, there still wouldn't be enough revenue, by her calculations. In other words, the proposal could add to the debt — the opposite of what Trump said he wanted it to do. \"To me, this seems less of a thought out policy proposal and more of, 'A $2,000 check sounds good. People are struggling with affordability. They're tired of inflation. What can I say to make them think I'm trying to do something?'\" York said. Then again, the White House is already saying the plan might not involve a straightforward check or payment sent to taxpayers, like the stimulus money during the height of COVID. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC's  This Week  on Sunday that voters might receive the money in the form of tax cuts that Congress  already passed  earlier this year. \"The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms,\" Bessent said. \"It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. You know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security.\" NPR asked the White House for additional details on the plan.  \"The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,\" said a White House official not authorized to speak on the record. Talking about revenues puts the Trump administration in a tricky position right now. Just last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments against some of Trump's tariffs, with tariff opponents saying Congress — not the president — has the power to levy taxes. In response, administration lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that revenues aren't the point of the tariffs. \"These are regulatory tariffs,\" Solicitor General John Sauer said to the justices. \"They are not revenue-raising tariffs. The fact that they raise revenue is only incidental.\" Asked on Sunday to square that argument with Trump's revenue talk, Bessent said the tariffs are ultimately meant to bring businesses back into the U.S. No matter what, Congress would have to authorize any payments. And even if the government were open, it's not a given that would happen. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Here is one thing that President Trump has said in recent months about the revenue being brought in by tariffs. That's money paid by American businesses, who pass on some of the costs to consumers. The president is suggesting that some of that money should go back to Americans. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports, Americans should not count on seeing the check just yet. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Trump is calling the payments dividends, but they are by no means a fleshed-out proposal. He briefly discussed them with reporters on Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: One of the things we're going to do, we're going to issue a dividend to our middle-income people and lower-income people of about $2,000. And we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt. KURTZLEBEN: That's most of the details he has provided on the idea. While details are scant, budget experts are already saying that there just isn't enough money for this idea. Erica York is one of them. She's vice president of federal tax policy at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. ERICA YORK: Even with the most conservative estimates applied to it, it doesn't work.

You might need to change the way you sleep \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Thursday, October 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Ever wake up with a sore lower back or achy shoulders that just ruin the rest of your day? Or get up from bed and try to greet the morning, only to find your neck is too stiff to turn to the window? Morning muscle pain along your spine is often the result of hours of improper support while sleeping, says  Ellen Wermter , a nurse practitioner who runs  Restorative Sleep Medicine , a sleep clinic in Virginia. One easy way to guard against it, say medical experts, is to focus on your sleep posture. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sleeping in an awkward position tends to create gaps between your body and your pillow or mattress, Wermter says. \"Your soft tissue is going to want to sag into those gaps, and the muscles tense to make up for that\" in order to protect against potential injury. Over the course of a night, that muscle tension can cause inflammation and pain, Wermter says — and bad sleep from all that tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position. Whether you sleep on your back, side or stomach, experts share advice for those looking to minimize morning aches and pains. Sleep the same way you stand  The best defense against an achy neck or back   in the morning is to sleep just like you stand, Wermter says.   When you sleep in a position that follows the natural curvature of your spine, it reduces the possibility of muscle strain. While lying down, your body should form a straight line from the top of your head to your tailbone. Wermter suggests placing   your ears over your shoulders and your shoulders over your hips. Point   your chin straight ahead, not tucked into your chest or stretched up toward the sky. Aim for symmetry with your arms for proper circulation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you're a back sleeper, this tip will be easier to follow. But if you're a side or stomach sleeper, you may need to adjust your sleep space for better spinal alignment — or even train yourself to sleep in this position, Wermter says. Avoid sleeping on your stomach  While this position can open up airways for struggling snorers, it's often associated with its potential downsides, Wermter says. That includes neck, back and shoulder aches, and fragmented sleep from switching positions more often throughout the night. When you sleep on your stomach, it's easy to overextend your neck, she says. Creating breathing room for yourself often pulls your neck out of that ideal spinal alignment. Choose the right pillow for your head   It's important to rest your head on something that supports your spine and promotes maximum restfulness at night, says  Dr. Fabian Morales , a sports medicine physician. Back sleepers:  Morales suggests a pillow with medium firmness and loft, or something with an ergonomic design. \"A good orthopedic pillow designed to support the curvature of the neck can minimize your risk of neck pain down the line. It reduces pressure on the neck and supports alignment,\" he says. Side sleepers:  To find a pillow with the right loft for side sleeping, \"measure from the bend of your neck to the edge of your shoulder,\" Wermter says. The ideal pillow will support your head without pushing your head and neck further up. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Stomach sleepers:  If you're stuck on stomach sleeping, Wermter says it might be best to go without a pillow to avoid extra strain on your neck. If you do need some cushion, aim for low-loft options to keep your spine aligned. Replace your pillows every few years or as soon as you notice your pillow starts to lack support, Morales says. Pillows hold on to dirt and dust — and they lose their structure over time, which can lead to aches and pains. Support any gaps with smaller pillows  When your spine isn't properly supported, pain is likely to follow, Wermter says. That's why it's important to align and cradle the entire length of your spine — not just your head and neck — to make up for any gaps between your body and the mattress. Use smaller pillows or even rolled up blankets or towels. Back sleepers:  Be mindful of any gaps at the small of your back or under your knees, which can be a source of lower back pain. Add support to those areas as needed, Wermter says. Side sleepers:  Many side sleepers like placing a small pillow between the knees or hugging a body pillow to align the hips and reduce pressure in the hips and lower back, she says. Stomach sleepers:  Wermter says just sleeping on a flat surface is fine for stomach sleepers, but some may find that a thin pillow under the hips and stomach can reduce strain on the back. Opt for a mattress that's not too soft and not too firm  Evaluate the quality of your mattress and replace your bed every seven years at most, says Wermter. If a mattress is too soft, the heavier parts of your body can sink and your spine will likely get out of alignment. If a mattress is too firm, it can create those pain-inducing gaps between body and bed. Try other pain relief remedies  What should you do if you have a great sleep setup and you still wake up with an achy back or a crick in your neck? It's a very common experience, especially as we age and our spines experience more wear and tear, says  Dr. Charla Fischer,  an   orthopedic spine surgeon at NYU Langone Health. That kind of muscle pain can be, well, a pain in the neck — but is usually not cause for major concern. Consult a medical professional if you have consistent pain for a week or more; experience numbness, tingling or weakness in the neck, arms or hands; or if you just have concerns, Fischer says. Otherwise, don't forget the power of basic pain relief remedies. Take  over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication , massage the area, do gentle stretches, or place ice or heating packs in 20- to 30-minute bouts on your body. Don't underestimate the power of a hot shower, she says. \"It can go a long way in calming down those unhappy muscles.\" This story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

In superb movies like  Reprise ,  Oslo, August 31st  and  The Worst Person in the World ,  he has probed the artistic dreams and frustrated desires of characters trying, and often failing, to figure out who they are. Trier's thoughtfulness is apparent even in his more middling films, like the Jesse Eisenberg drama  Louder Than Bombs  and the supernatural thriller  Thelma , both of which were keyed into the profound ways our families can mess us up. Complicated parent-child relationships are also at the heart of  Sentimental Value , a new drama that many have hailed as Trier's best movie to date. But I've seen the film twice now, and although it's thoughtfully crafted and well acted, it strikes me as one of Trier's lesser efforts — the kind of lofty, self-consciously mature work that often gets more praise than its richer, livelier predecessors. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Renate Reinsve , the radiant star of  The Worst Person in the World , here plays Nora, an accomplished stage actor whose mother has recently died. As she grieves with her younger sister, Agnes, wonderfully played by Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, Nora must deal with the return of their long-estranged father, Gustav, played by  Stellan Skarsgård . Gustav, a film director of some note, abandoned the family when the girls were still young. Now, years later, he surprises Nora by presenting her with a new script and asking her to play the lead role. Nora turns him down, and so Gustav casts a Hollywood star, Rachel Kemp, played by Elle Fanning. (Gustav's movie is being financed by Netflix, which allows Trier to introduce some delectable film-industry satire.) Rachel is game and loves Gustav's work, but she's clearly ill at ease with the material — partly because she isn't Norwegian, and partly because the character seems based on Gustav's mother, who died tragically when he was just a boy.  In various scenes, Trier directs us to pay attention to his actors' shifting expressions and silences, all the pointed things they leave unsaid. When Nora has an unexplained attack of stage fright on the opening night of her play, we wonder if it's rooted in a certain ambivalence about acting — a profession that connects her to her father, whether she likes it or not. Agnes and Gustav get along better, possibly because she starred in one of his films when she was a young girl — a brief bonding experience that her sister never had. Gustav, it seems, is the kind of father who can only parent through a camera lens. It's bittersweet that he treats Rachel with a paternal warmth that he seldom shows his own daughters. In the uniformly strong cast, I liked Fanning the best. Her character has a bracing and very American directness that cuts through all the wry Nordic reserve. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trier clearly respects the audience's intelligence, which earns our respect in return.

Trier and his regular co-writer, Eskil Vogt, seem strangely incurious about their characters' art; I wanted to see more of Nora's acting, and to hear more of Gustav's script. In lieu of this, the movie floats a lot of whispery notions about how art and life converge. Even when artists turn out to be lousy parents, it suggests, art itself can be a vessel for reconciliation and healing. This idea is not exactly the stuff of revelation, and the movie basically rubber-stamps it without developing or dramatizing it anew. A big part of the story involves the beloved family house where Nora and Agnes grew up, and which Gustav wants to use as the shooting location for his new film. We're meant to see that our homes become repositories of memory, filled with the ghosts of generations past. But there's something a little precious about these themes, just as there's something pat and predictable about the way the drama resolves. In building toward a redemptive ending,  Sentimental Value  lets everyone off the hook too easily, especially Gustav. You can't blame Skarsgård, who plays the role with his typically irresistible, irascible charm. But it's hard not to feel that Trier, in indulging this character, is favoring the priorities of art over the tougher questions of life. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:   This is FRESH AIR.

Our film critic Justin Chang has this review. JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Few filmmakers are as attuned as Joachim Trier to the inner lives of young people. In superb movies like \"Reprise,\" \"Oslo, August 31\" and \"The Worst Person In The World,\" he has probed the artistic dreams and frustrated desires of characters trying and often failing to figure out who they are. Trier's thoughtfulness is apparent even in his more middling films, like the Jessie Eisenberg drama \"Louder Than Bombs\" and the supernatural thriller \"Thelma,\" both of which were keyed into the profound ways our families can mess us up.

Rachel is game and loves Gustav's work, but she's clearly ill at ease with the material, partly because she isn't Norwegian and partly because the character seems based on Gustav's mother, who died tragically when he was just a boy. In this scene, Rachel meets with Nora, hoping to gain more insight into not only the role but also Gustav's family dynamics.

FANNING: (As Rachel Kemp) I just can't get a handle on her, you know? The more that I study her, the more lost I feel trying to be her. It's like her sadness is - it's such an overwhelming part of her.

In lieu of this, the movie floats a lot of whispery notions about how art and life converge. Even when artists turn out to be lousy parents, it suggests, art itself can be a vessel for reconciliation and healing. This idea is not exactly the stuff of revelation, and the movie basically rubber stamps it without developing or dramatizing it anew. A big part of the story involves the beloved family house where Nora and Agnes grew up and which Gustav wants to use as the shooting location for his new film. We're meant to see that our homes become repositories of memory, filled with the ghosts of generations past. But there's something a little precious about these themes, just as there's something pat and predictable about the way the drama resolves. In building toward a redemptive ending, \"Sentimental Value\" lets everyone off the hook too easily, especially Gustav. You can't blame Skarsgard, who plays the role with his typically irrrsistible, irascible charm. But it's hard not to feel that Trier, in indulging this character, is favoring the priorities of art over the tougher questions of life. MOSLEY: Justin Chang is a film critic for the New Yorker.

Turkey (AP) — A Turkish military cargo plane with 20 people on board crashed in Georgia near the border with Azerbaijan on Tuesday, authorities said, but they gave no immediate confirmation of feared casualties. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and top officials from Georgia and Azerbaijan signaled that at least some of those aboard were believed to have been killed, without providing details. Video footage aired on Turkish news outlets appeared to show the aircraft spiraling down and leaving a trail of white smoke. The C-130 plane had taken off from Azerbaijan and was on its way back to Turkey when it crashed, Turkey’s Ministry of National Defense said on X. The ministry said there were 20 military personnel on board, including crew members. Georgian authorities reached the crash site at around 5 p.m., Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said, adding that a search and rescue operation was continuing. The Georgian Interior Ministry said the aircraft crashed in Georgia’s Sighnaghi municipality, close to the Azerbaijani border, adding that an investigation has begun. Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency quoted the Georgian aviation authority as saying that contact with the plane was lost a few minutes after it had entered Georgia’s airspace. The plane had not issued a distress call, it said.

Nearly 20 years ago, the Maine Democrat drunkenly selected a skull and crossbones design while out on leave with his fellow Marines in Croatia. It wasn’t until several weeks into his campaign for a key U.S. Senate seat that Platner says he discovered that the design was recognized as a Nazi symbol. Rather than wait through multiple sessions of laser removal, Platner called a friend to help him get rid of it.

I found out it’s something I don’t want, can you help me cover it up?’” Mischa Ostberg, an artist based in Ellsworth, Maine, told The Associated Press in an interview. Ostberg, a self-proclaimed “baby tattooer” who has been licensed to ink for just two years, was eager to help. For Ostberg, the request wasn’t abnormal — covering up a design is a common practice in the tattoo world — and Platner’s willingness to take action when learning about the image’s connection to Nazis was reflective of the friend Ostberg had known for years.

Diana Harshbarger’s husband, who pleaded guilty more than a decade ago to health care fraud and other crimes and served time in federal prison. Robert Harshbarger Jr. was a licensed pharmacist in 2013 when he admitted substituting a cheaper drug imported from China that was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the iron sucrose that the FDA had approved for kidney dialysis patients to use. He was sentenced to and served four years in prison. Trump signed the pardon document on Friday, according to the website of the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice. It was among several pardons the Republican president issued, including to a former speaker of the Tennessee House and to former Major League Baseball slugger and New York Mets great Darryl Strawberry . Trump last week also pardoned a former New York police sergeant who was convicted of helping China try to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland . On Monday, Trump pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani , his onetime chief of staff Mark Meadows and many others accused of backing his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

The official insisted on anonymity to discuss the reasoning behind Trump’s clemency decision. Presidents have broad constitutional powers to grant pardons, which do not erase criminal convictions but can be seen as acts of justice or mercy, often in cases that can further public welfare. Harshbarger turned to the Chinese drug due to a backlog of the iron sucrose drug, the White House official said. No patients were alleged to have been harmed by the substitution, and doctors seemed to prefer the drug Harshbarger gave them because it was easier to administer, the official said. Prosecutors said that even though there were no reports of patients being harmed, Harshbarger’s substitution still put patients at risk since the FDA cannot assure the safety and effectiveness of products from other countries. Harshbarger has served his sentence, the official said. He also was ordered to pay restitution, pay a fine and forfeit $425,000 in cash. Rep. Harshbarger, who is also a licensed pharmacist, was first elected to the U.S. House in 2020 and has been a strong supporter of Trump. She spoke in support of Trump outside his hush money criminal trial in New York in 2024 and in other settings. Trump has backed all of her congressional campaigns and offered her his “Complete and Total Endorsement” for reelection in 2026 in a Nov. 3 social media post.

The case highlighted tensions between local law enforcement and press freedom, especially in rural communities, and prompted a national debate on press rights and governmental overreach.

(AP) — A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay a little more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023 that sparked an outcry over press freedom. Marion County sheriff’s officers were involved in the raid on the Marion County Record and helped draft search warrants used by Marion city police to enter the newspaper’s offices, the publisher’s home and the home of a local city council member.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “They intentionally wanted to harass us for reporting the news, and you’re not supposed to do that in a democracy,” the editor and publisher, Eric Meyer, said Tuesday. He added he hoped the payment was large enough to discourage similar actions against other news organizations in the future. The raid prompted five federal lawsuits against the county, the city of Marion and local officials. Meyer’s 98-year-old mother Joan, the paper’s co-owner, died of a heart attack the next day, something he blames on the stress of the raid. During the raid, authorities seized cellphones and computers from the newsroom and rifled through reporters’ desks. Search warrants linked the raid to a dispute between a local restaurant owner and the newspaper, which had obtained a copy of her driving record while reporting on her request for a city liquor license. The raid also came after the newspaper had dug into the background of the police chief at the time who led the raid.

Follow on An attorney for the newspaper, Bernie Rhodes, released a copy Tuesday of the five-page agreement resolving legal claims against the county. Claims against the city and city officials have not been settled, and Meyer said he believes they will face a larger judgment once those claims are eventually resolved. Marion County’s administrator and attorneys for the city and county did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Raid’s legality was questioned Under the judgment, the estate of Meyer’s mother will receive $1 million. Meyer, two former Record reporters and the paper’s business manager will split $1.1 million, and Ruth Herbel, the former city council member, will receive $650,000. Meyer said he’s considering a fund to ensure that the paper remains financially viable or a program to encourage young journalists to work in communities like his. “The goal isn’t to get the money. The money is symbolic,” Meyer said. “The press has basically been under assault.” Three days after the raid, the local prosecutor said there wasn’t enough evidence to justify it. Experts said Marion’s police chief at the time, Gideon Cody, was on legally shaky ground when he ordered it, and a former top federal prosecutor for Kansas suggested it might have been a criminal violation of civil rights. Doug Anstaett, a retired Kansas Press Association executive director, said Tuesday that the raid violated the state’s shield law for journalists. It allows law enforcement agencies to seek subpoenas to obtain confidential information from news organizations but requires them to show a compelling interest and that they can’t obtain it in another way. Anstaett was the association’s executive director when the law was enacted in 2010. The Record is known for its aggressive coverage of local issues, and Anstaett suggested police where trying to “get at” Meyer because of his adversarial relationships with local officials, adding, “it totally backfired.” “They didn’t follow any of those requirements and therefore it was really a slam dunk in terms of whether they broke the law or not,” he said. Genelle Belmas, a University of Kansas professor who teaches media law, described the raid as “an egregious violation of the First Amendment rights” of Meyer and the weekly. “I share his hope that an award of this size serves as a deterrent against future ill-conceived warrants with political motivations,” she said. “And no amount of money brings Joan Meyer back. We need to stay vigilant against government incursions on the press.” Sheriff issues apology The search warrants were premised on the idea that the newspaper and a reporter had illegally impersonated the local restaurant owner to obtain her driving record online and that the former city council member Herbel illegally circulated it by sending a cellphone screenshot to the city manager. Two special prosecutors who reviewed the raid and its aftermath said nearly a year later that the Record, its staff and Herbel had committed no crimes before the raid. The prosecutors also said the warrants signed by a judge contained inaccurate information from an “inadequate investigation” and that the searches were not legally justified. Cody resigned as police chief in October 2023. Cody is scheduled to go to trial in February in Marion County on a felony charge of interfering with a judicial process, accused by the two special prosecutors of persuading a potential witness to withhold information from authorities investigating his conduct. He had pleaded not guilty and did not respond to a text message Tuesday seeking comment about the county’s agreement. The charge against Cody stems from text messages between him and the business owner after the raid. The business owner has said Cody asked her to delete text messages between them, fearing people could get a wrong idea about their relationship, which she said was professional and platonic. The Marion County Commission approved the agreement Monday after discussing it in private for 15 minutes. The agreement required Sheriff Jeff Soyez to issue an apology. “The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion County Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record,” the sheriff’s statement said. ___ Hollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/uk-china-cryptoqueen-bitcoin-fraud-b115ccc6e98f015dad01fa75d6ce0cf7","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:54:43Z","title":"Chinese Woman Sentenced to Over 11 Years in Prison for Crypto Ponzi Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zhimin Qian, a Chinese woman, was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in prison in the UK for running a massive Ponzi scheme between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 people in China.

billion) in Bitcoin after defrauding more than 128,000 people in China in a Ponzi scheme was sentenced by a U.K. court on Tuesday to over 11 years in prison. Police said the investigation into Zhimin Qian, 47, led to officers recovering devices holding 61,000 Bitcoin in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the U.K. Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said. Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets. When she attracted the attention of Chinese authorities, Qian fled to the U.K. under a fake identity. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month, and tried but failed to buy multimillion pound properties in a bid to convert the Bitcoin.

You left China without a thought for the people whose investments you had stolen and enjoyed for a period of time a lavish lifestyle. You lied and schemed, all the while seeking to benefit yourself,” Hales said. The businesswoman, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering offenses and transferring and possessing criminal property, was sentenced Tuesday to 11 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court.

November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The set-up for a typical Jesse Welles video is simple: the 32-year-old stands in an open field under a string of powerlines, clutching an acoustic guitar. From behind a tousled, curly mop of hair, he stares straight into the camera and starts singing. \"If you're in need of a gig that'll help you feel big, come with me and put some folks in detention,\" he deadpans in one song, a scathing critique of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. \"We can sneak around town, hunting working folks down, I hear they get a great benefit plan.\" \"Join ICE\" is just one of the dozens of songs Welles routinely shares on social media. They're often short and satirical tunes, riding on his coarse voice and fingerpicked guitar strings, that respond to the major headlines of the week. They challenge the narratives presented to Americans by governments and corporations; they draw historical parallels and unearth underlying tensions that lead people to blame one another for institutional injustices. On the Internet, Jesse Welles' songs are major hits. Thousands of people flock to the comments, calling him a modern day  Bob Dylan  or  Woody Guthrie . Since he started regularly posting clips last year, Welles has amassed more than 3 million followers on TikTok and Instagram combined, not to mention his over 600,000 YouTube subscribers. The Recording Academy has also taken notice; last week, Welles  received  four Grammy nominations in the folk and Americana categories. He's become one of the most visible examples of a new generation of digital-savvy artists bringing folk traditions to a modern medium. \"We've never been this informed,\" Welles tells NPR about Americans today. \"Pair being informed with being disempowered — being that aware and having so little hard influence on the aspects of your life that you're so awake to. I think that explains a lot of people's frustration.\" Welles wasn't always a country-leaning singer-songwriter. He spent years playing in different iterations of rock bands, experimenting with folk and  grunge . Nearly a decade ago, he signed to a label in Nashville, burnt out and went back home to Arkansas. In 2024, after his father suffered a heart attack, the now-independent artist says he had a spiritual awakening that put him on his current path. The songs began to pour out, some political and some not. So far, his music has addressed the  war in Gaza ,  the Epstein list  and the Trump administration's claims that Tylenol is  linked  to autism. Although Welles' lyrics skew pro-working class and anti-violence, fans trying to neatly categorize his political affiliations might run into trouble. In August, he raised some eyebrows when he appeared on  The Joe Rogan Experience . A month later, he released a song condemning the  assassination  of  Charlie Kirk . It sparked both praise and backlash. On TikTok and Instagram, some people questioned how Welles could mourn a man who often made bigoted statements about minorities and helped elect the same politicians the singer criticizes in his lyrics. Welles says that for him, there's no use in trying to control how people perceive him or how they attempt to project partisan lines onto his music. His bottom line, he says, is radical nonviolence. \"I visit a lot of different echo chambers. I pop in, pop out — see what's going on in different corners,\" Welles says. \"You start to wonder, where's the throughline? Because there's obviously an issue, but neither corners' justifications for their actions or reactions is really satisfying. So I think I just started looking for some sense.\" Audiences on and offline are right there with him. Welles released multiple studio albums this year, which include collaborations with rising Americana stars  Sierra Ferrell  and  Billy Strings . He was awarded the 2025 John Prine Songwriting Fellowship and performed at both Newport Folk Festival and Farm Aid. He's also been selling out shows across the country, where he's been joined onstage by  Joan Baez  and  John Fogerty . Welles' success shows that his music is resonating widely, as a new generation of artists revive bold, plainspoken protest music for today's digital age. A long tradition of protest songs Protest music has always been deeply embedded in the American fabric, but its popularity has come and gone. Tammy L. Kernodle, a musicologist and professor at Miami University, says there's been different moments throughout history in which the folk music of particular communities or ethnic groups has been used for mass mobilization. \"When we talk about folk music, we're talking about the music that developed out of the everyday experiences of people. It was part of their ritual,\" she explains. \"Within those repertoires, there's always been songs that have been about articulating people's frustration.\" Throughout the 20th century, folk music played a key role in organizing movements across labor, politics, race and gender. From the Great Depression to the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, the struggle for liberation played out explicitly in protest songs and implicitly in the emergence of new genres like rock, disco and hip-hop. But as the century came to a close, Kernodle says folk songs documenting people's realities and advocating for social change became less and less central to pop culture. \"When we started to move into the last decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, those messages started to be filtered out because of the infrastructure and how music became so vastly commodified because of globalization,\" Kernodle says. \"The industry began to work against it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the early to mid-2000s, major labels and mainstream radio stations mostly shied away from songs with overt political messaging, though folk, punk and protest scenes still flourished underground. With the rise of social media, it became easier for artists to bypass industry gatekeepers. In the last decade, hip-hop has largely carried the torch of musical protest,  particularly  during the Black Lives Matter  mobilizations  of 2020 and the rise of the COVID-19  pandemic . Today, anyone can write a song and upload it to the Internet, but they're also competing with a flood of information: a 24-hour news cycle, personalized algorithms and never-ending scrolling. With an increasingly fractured attention economy and a deeply polarized society, many people are looking for spaces of connection; communities that take their concerns seriously and make them feel heard. Kernodle says the simplicity of a front-facing camera and a banjo or guitar calls back to earlier folk traditions; simpler days of someone singing about their day on a front porch or in a town hall — and it carries real power. \"We are moving into a society that wants to read less. Most of us are getting our information from this very visual culture: TikTok, Instagram and all of these things,\" Kernodle explains. \"Music is also underscored. So these individuals are doing what their predecessors did, but on a different digital platform.\" How one artist cuts through the noise  One of those artists is Mon Rovîa, who's racked up more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram, all before releasing his debut album. Born in Liberia during the West African nations' first civil war, he was adopted by an American missionary family as a child. Mon Rovîa moved around a lot growing up and gravitated towards reading and writing poetry; as he got older, he settled in Tennessee and began channeling his energy into music, initially dabbling with hip-hop and bedroom alt-pop. In 2022, he planted his feet into an Afro-Appalachian sound that blends indie folk influences like  Fleet Foxes  and  Bon Iver  with the musical traditions of the region he now calls home. He says music did not play a big role in his early childhood in Liberia — but given Appalachian folk music's  deep roots  in West African instruments and rhythms, Mon Rovîa's sound comes full circle, doubly honoring his identity. He writes guitar and ukulele-driven melodies that nudge his honeyed vocals to the forefront, often reminiscent of the intimate folk songs of British troubadour Labi Siffre. On TikTok, he'll share videos of himself playing and singing with friends, or will overlay his songs over clips of himself making tea. This kind of content is often at odds with the attention-grabbing, chaotic pace of the algorithm. Amid that slow tranquility, Mon Rovîa delivers messages against oppression, gun violence and war. \"A lot of times, the world is already too loud and angry,\" he tells NPR. \"Peace and thoughtfulness can cut through a lot of that noise.\" His song \"Heavy Foot,\" which he performed during his Grand Ole Opry debut this summer, rallies around collective care and empathy in the face of hostile politicians and systems of power. \"Do you see the man on the screen, just a puppet but you never see the strings,\" Mon Rovîa sings. \"Calling it a war 'n not a genocide, telling us it isn't what it seems.\" On social media, he's shared the song over clips of pro-Palestinian protests around the world, as well as with text that reads: \"'Who radicalized you?' I did NOT recite 'with liberty and justice for all' every morning at 7AM just to be called radical for wanting liberty and justice for all.\" Beyond social media, he also performed alongside Jesse Welles at this year's Newport Folk Festival and is selling out national tours. Although Mon Rovîa didn't initially set out to make protest music, he says he's embracing the movement. \"I think the important piece about protest music is the truth factor,\" he says. \"I think it becomes protest because we put that word around it, but really it's just a search for the truth. To reveal it and to say it as it is and not beat around the bush.\" He credits writers like  James Baldwin  and  Toni Morrison  with inspiring him to make art as a personal form of activism. Musicologist Kernodle says these links in time — in instruments, themes and influences — are an essential part of the protest folk tradition. \"True protest music does this. It reflects on the past. It is documenting the present, and what it is speaking to is the hope of the future,\" she says. \"That's what we see in some of this material that is coming out of these digital platforms.\" Looking at the future For 28-year-old singer-songwriter  Jensen McRae , that lineage is a grounding exercise for facing the current political climate. \"I have Post-it notes above my desk, and it just has a list of all of the Black women from history that I admire and am trying to model myself after,\" she tells NPR. \"It says, 'You're standing on the shoulders of your ancestors, you can get through this.' \" McRae is a 21st century Laurel Canyon-style folk singer with indie rock sensibilities. Raised in Los Angeles with a steady soundtrack of pop, R&B and  Carole King , she studied music at the University of Southern California. As a college student, she traded in piano for acoustic guitar as her primary instrument when she realized it was much easier to carry from gig to gig. She wanted to become a storyteller, and to her that meant writing folk songs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, she wrote a viral  Phoebe Bridgers   parody  track about getting the COVID-19 vaccine at Dodger Stadium. She's released two acoustic-pop albums since then, full of heartbreaking and incisive lyricism (she jokes that as a woman, people expect her to write songs about the worst thing that's ever happened to her — and she delivers). She's sold out shows on both sides of the Atlantic, opened for acts like  MUNA  and  Noah Kahan  and  found a fan  in none other than  Justin Bieber . This summer, she also appeared in Spike Lee's  Highest 2 Lowest . But as she's found more mainstream success, McRae has also felt a deep responsibility to respond to \"the historical moment that we're in that's been going on for basically my entire adult life.\" Online, she shares defiantly unpolished protest songs like \"You Started It\" and \"The Men are Disappearing\" to her more than 500,000 followers across TikTok and Instagram. Shot on McRae's phone, the stripped-down videos of her singing and strumming the guitar don't necessarily look out of place on her social media feeds. She's the kind of Internet native who regularly posts works-in-progress song clips, covers and snippets of herself reading old diary entries. But in her more political songs, pinned to the top of her TikTok profile, McRae touches on school shootings, racial injustice, the military industrial complex and the  deportation  of migrants from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador. She says that with how long it takes to craft an album, she's drawn to posting political songs online for the immediacy — she wants to meet the moment as it's happening. She also finds catharsis in not having to think about branding or marketing the music; instead, the songs are a tool for raising consciousness. \"There's a part of me that feels a little bit funny about profiting off of that music,\" she says, noting that her TikTok is not monetized. \"The reason that I'm writing it is to give other people the language to talk about this thing that maybe they don't understand.\" Existing as a folk artist closer to the pop mainstream, she sees her role akin to \"sneaking vegetables into people's brownies\" — sparking sociopolitical awareness in audiences that may not be overtly seeking it out. That in itself, she says, is a form of resistance. \"My hope is that in 30 or 50 years, my children or grandchildren will be living in a time where the pendulum has swung back in a more progressive direction,\" McRae says. \"They'll look back and go, 'Oh my God, I can't believe you were making art during that time when that administration and that court and those police forces were so conservative and were so combative.' I want to be a part of the reason why future generations feel like they can say anything and do anything.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/britain-bbc-crisis-trump-panorama-a392fb275af25216ea23537c6f4347e4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:17:25+00:00","title":"Trump Threatens Legal Action Against BBC Over Edited Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC faced a major political and journalistic crisis after editing a January 6, 2021, speech by U.S. President Donald Trump, combining segments that gave the impression of a call to 'fight like hell' and march to the Capitol.

speech he made was edited in a documentary aired by Britain’s national broadcaster. BBC chairman Samir Shah on Monday apologized for the “error of judgment,” which triggered the resignations of the BBC’s top executive and its head of news. Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing of a speech Trump delivered on Jan. 6, 2021, before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. The hourlong documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — was broadcast as part of the BBC’s “Panorama” series days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Shah said the broadcaster accepted “that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.” Related Stories China and Spain signs agreements to strengthen cooperation on Spanish king’s visit 2 MIN READ Diverse and resilient energy production is needed to meet future demand, global report says 4 MIN READ Small grocers and convenience stores feel an impact as customers go without SNAP benefits 4 MIN READ A letter from Trump attorney Alejandro Brito demands the BBC “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements,” apologize and “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused,” or face legal action for $1 billion in damages. The BBC said it would review the letter “and respond directly in due course.” Top executives quit Trump had earlier welcomed the resignations of the two BBC executives. He posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that “a terrible thing for Democracy!” In a resignation letter to staff, Davie said: “There have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” Turness said the controversy was damaging the BBC, and she quit “because the buck stops with me.” She defended the organization’s journalists against allegations of bias. “Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality, and I will stand by their journalism,” she said Monday. “There is no institutional bias. Mistakes are made, but there’s no institutional bias.” Trump speech edited Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The “Panorama” episode showed an edited clip from the January 2021 speech in which Trump claimed the 2020 presidential election had been rigged. Trump is shown saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” According to video and a transcript from Trump’s comments that day , he said:  “I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. “Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Trump used the “fight like hell” phrase toward the end of the speech, but without referencing the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. In a letter to Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Shah said the purpose of editing Trump’s words had been “to convey the message of the speech” so that viewers could understand how it had been received by Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground. He said the program had not attracted “significant audience feedback” when it first aired but had drawn more than 500 complaints since Prescott’s dossier was made public. Shah acknowledged in a BBC interview that “it would have been better to have acted earlier. But we didn’t.” A national institution The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households who watch live TV or any BBC content. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It’s frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. Governments of both left and right have long been accused of meddling with the broadcaster, which is overseen by a board that includes both BBC nominees and government appointees. Some defenders of the BBC allege that members of the board appointed under previous Conservative governments have been undermining the corporation from within. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman, Tom Wells, said the center-left Labour Party government supports “a strong, independent BBC” and doesn’t think the broadcaster is biased. “But it is important that the BBC acts to maintain trust and corrects mistakes quickly when they occur,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed from Washington."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-food-aid-024906c49fec6126585900ef916698f8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:07:05+00:00","title":"Supreme Court Extends Block on Full SNAP Payments Amid Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court extended a temporary order blocking full SNAP benefits amid a government shutdown, maintaining uncertainty for millions of Americans who rely on food assistance.

The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing. The order, which is three sentences long and comes with no explanation on the court’s thinking, will expire just before midnight Thursday. The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it’s not clear how quickly full payments would resume. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Ruling follows path of least legal resistance The justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn’t otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments. The court’s action doesn’t do anything to settle uncertainty across the country. Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments. How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it’s easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount. An urgent need for beneficiaries In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year. That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what’s left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen. “It’s kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.” The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help . “I figure that I’ve spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York. SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans. The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order in a ruling late Sunday. An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume , and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments. Congressional talks about reopening government The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans. President Donald Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it “looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.” Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn’t be up to the courts. “The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. “The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.” After Tuesday’s ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: “Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.” The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion. “The chaos was sown by USDA’s delays and intransigence,” they said, “not by the district court’s efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.” ___ Associated Press reporter Cara Anna in Carthage, New York, contributed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"COP30, the 30th United Nations climate conference, has opened in Belem, Brazil, at the edge of the Amazon rainforest, uniting leaders from over 190 countries to address the escalating climate crisis.

in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations  climate change conference (COP30)  has started in the Brazilian city of Belem, with leaders calling for countries to take a united approach against global warming.\n\n“In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told delegates on Monday.\n\nSome 50,000 people from more than 190 countries are expected to attend the 12-day event, which is being held at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.\n\nAddressing the conference, Stiell said that previous climate talks had helped, but that there was “much more work to do”.\n\nThe UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” the US’s former special envoy for climate, Todd Stern, said of the Trump administration’s decision.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago said the US’s absence “has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing”.\n\nPablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru, urged world leaders to do more than simply give pledges at this year’s conference.\n\n“We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” he said.\n\nIn a letter to COP30 that was published on Monday, dozens of scientists expressed their fears about the melting of glaciers, ice sheets and other frozen parts of the planet.\n\n“The cryosphere is destabilising at an alarming pace,” they wrote. “Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30. Climate change is the defining security and stability challenge of our time.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1211-01-01","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-00:00","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global events: Afghanistan's crisis in managing 4.5 million returnees due to aid cuts; South Korea’s political turmoil following Yoon Suk-yeol’s martial law attempt; Parisian regulatory scrutiny of Shein’s illicit marketplace; Brazil’s President Lula advocating for Indigenous-led climate action; a major Bitcoin seizure from Zhimin Qian in a long-term money laundering case; ongoing Ukrainian military conflict in Zaporizhia; BBC’s defense of editorial independence; a deadly blast at a South Asian court with regional consequences; political criticism of U.S. leadership at COP30; fan backlash over a sports trade; and political instability in the U.S. affecting food aid distribution.

painstakingly piece together anti-drone devices . Some of the devices will be exported to Kyiv in the hopes of jamming Russian technology on the battlefield, while others will be shipped across Europe in efforts to combat mysterious drone intrusions into NATO’s airspace that have the entire continent on edge. Two Danish companies whose business was predominantly defense-related now say they have a surge in new clients seeking to use their technology to protect sites like airports, military installations and critical infrastructure, all of which have been targeted by drone flyovers in recent weeks. Weibel Scientific’s radar drone detection technology was deployed ahead of a key EU summit earlier this year to Copenhagen Airport, where unidentified drone sightings closed the airspace for hours in September. Counter-drone firm MyDefence, from its warehouse in northern Denmark, builds handheld, wearable radio frequency devices that sever the connection between a drone and its pilot to neutralize the threat. So-called “jamming” is restricted and heavily regulated in the European Union, but widespread on the battlefields of Ukraine and has become so extensive there that Russia and Ukraine have started deploying drones tethered by thin fiber-optic cables that don’t rely on radio frequency signals. Russia also is firing attack drones with extra antenna to foil Ukraine’s jamming efforts . A spike in drone incursions Drone warfare exploded following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia has bombarded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks, striking railways , power facilities and cities across the country. Ukraine, in response, has launched daring strikes deep inside Russia using domestically produced drones. But Europe as a whole is now on high alert after the drone flyovers into NATO’s airspace reached an unprecedented scale in September, prompting European leaders to agree to develop a “drone wall” along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe’s airspace. In November, NATO military officials said a new U.S. anti-drone system was deployed to the alliance’s eastern flank. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response, which raised questions about how prepared the alliance is against Russia . Key challenges include the ability to detect drones — sometimes mistaken for a bird or plane on radar systems — and take them down cheaply. The Kremlin has brushed off allegations that Russia is behind some of the unidentified drone flights in Europe. Andreas Graae, assistant professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, said there is a “huge drive” to rapidly deploy counter-drone systems in Europe amid Russia’s aggression. “All countries in Europe are struggling to find the right solutions to be prepared for these new drone challenges,” he said. “We don’t have all the things that are needed to actually be good enough to detect drones and have early warning systems.” Putting ‘machines before people’ Founded in 2013, MyDefence makes devices that can be used to protect airports, government buildings and other critical infrastructure, but chief executive Dan Hermansen called the Russia-Ukraine war a “turning point” for his company. More than 2,000 units of its wearable “Wingman” detector have been delivered to Ukraine since Russia invaded nearly four years ago. “For the past couple of years, we’ve heard in Ukraine that they want to put machines before people” to save lives, Hermansen said. MyDefence last year doubled its earnings to roughly $18.7 million compared to 2023. Then came the drone flyovers earlier this year. Besides Copenhagen Airport, drones flew over four smaller Danish airports, including two that serve as military bases. Hermansen said they were an “eye-opener” for many European countries and prompted a surge of interest in their technology. MyDefence went from the vast majority of its business being defense-related to inquiries from officials representing police forces and critical infrastructure. “Seeing suddenly that drone warfare is not just something that happens in Ukraine or on the eastern flank, but basically is something that we need to take care of in a hybrid warfare threat scenario,” he added. Radar technology used against drones On NATO’s eastern flank, Denmark, Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against drones. The American Merops system , which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsize pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed. The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow’s forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing the line from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, NATO military officials told The Associated Press. North of Copenhagen, Weibel Scientific has been making Doppler radar technology since the 1970s. Typically used in tracking radar systems for the aerospace industry, it’s now being applied to drone detection like at Copenhagen Airport. The technology can determine the velocity of an object, such as a drone, based on the change in wavelength of a signal being bounced back. Then it’s possible to predict the direction the object is moving, Weibel Scientific chief executive Peter Røpke said. “The Ukraine war, and especially how it has evolved over the last couple of years with drone technology, means this type of product is in high demand,” Røpke said. Earlier this year, Weibel secured a $76 million deal, which the firm called its “largest order ever.” The drone flyovers boosted the demand even higher as discussion around the proposed “drone wall” continued. Røpke said his technology could become a “key component” of any future drone shield. ___ Stefanie Dazio in Berlin contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/bob-ross-paintings-auction-pbs-benefit-funding-4f4f055d6838ab4e802f1a422496c881","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:31:39+00:00","title":"Bob Ross Paintings Sell for Over $600,000 to Help Public TV Stations Affected by Federal Cuts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three paintings from Bob Ross’s 'The Joy of Painting' series, created during a 1993 episode, sold for over $600,000 at a Bonhams auction in Los Angeles, with proceeds benefiting public television stations suffering from federal funding cuts.

The paintings were the first of 30 Ross works being sold to benefit public TV stations hurt by cuts in federal funding. At the live auction at Bonhams in Los Angeles, a serene, snow vista called “Winter’s Peace” that Ross painted entirely during a 1993 episode of “The Joy of Painting” went for $318,000 to a bidder on the phone. “For a good cause — and you get the painting,” auctioneer Aaron Bastian said during the bidding. He invoked a common sentiment of Ross, who died in 1995, during a brief lull. “Bob would remind you that this is your world, and you can do anything you want.” Another painting done on a 1993 episode, a lush, green landscape called “Home in the Valley,” went for $229,100. A third, “Cliffside,” sold for $114,800. The final prices include a charge for the auction house added to the final bid known as the buyer’s premium. The identities of the buyers weren’t immediately revealed. Bids for all three paintings went well past pre-auction estimates of their value, which topped out around $50,000.

All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television. Ross, a public television staple in the 1980s and ‘90s, was known for his dome of hair and warm demeanor. The special sales seek to help stations in need of licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that along with Ross’ show include “America’s Test Kitchen,” “Julia Child’s French Chef Classics,” and “This Old House.” Small and rural stations are particularly challenged. The stations “have been the gateway for generations of viewers to discover not just Bob’s gentle teaching, but the transformative power of the arts,” Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc., said in a statement. As sought by the Trump Administration, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations . Ross died at age 52 of complications from cancer after 11 years in production with the therapeutic how-to show, “The Joy of Painting.” The former Air Force drill sergeant was a sort of pioneer, known for his calm — and calming — manner and encouraging words. Ross spoke often as he worked on air about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only “happy accidents.” He has only became more popular in the decades since his death, and his shows saw a surge in popularity during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

of artificial intelligence. U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices declined. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 inched less than 0.1% lower to 50,823.52. SoftBank Group’s shares plunged as much as 9% and was down 6.6% by midday. It said Tuesday that it sold its entire stake in the AI chip company Nividia for $5.83 billion last month, raising funds for other investments. AP AUDIO: The Dow rallies 500 points toward a record even as Nvidia sags The AP’s Seth Sutel reports U.S. stocks are drifting in mixed trading. A big question has been whether investors will push the frenzy around AI stocks further. Their sensational growth has been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and still-high inflation . But their prices have shot so high that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.7% to 26,871.02, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.2% to 3,993.35. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 inched up less than 0.1% to 8,822.00.

It’s been bouncing around lately, coming off Monday’s vigorous rebound following its first losing week in four. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.2%, to a record close of 47,927.96, surpassing its prior all-time high set two weeks ago . The Nasdaq composite lagged the market as Nvidia slipped 3% due to continued concerns that stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy may have become too expensive . The Nasdaq dipped 0.3% to 23,468.30. Helping to lead the market was Paramount Skydance, whose shares jumped 9.8% even though the entertainment giant reported revenue and profit for the latest quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. It was the company’s first earnings report since Skydance closed its acquisition of Paramount in early August. Close behind was FedEx, which climbed 5.4% after it increased its forecast for profit in the current quarter. Instead of expecting growth from just the summer, the delivery company now also expects profit to rise in this year’s holiday-shopping season from last year’s. In the U.S. bond market, trading was closed for the Veterans Day holiday. What’s making the Fed’s job potentially more difficult is that the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important updates on jobs and other areas of the economy. The Senate has made moves to end what’s become the longest-ever shutdown, but it’s not assured. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude declined 17 cents to $60.87 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 18 cents to $64.98 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 154.30 Japanese yen from 154.04 yen.

globe, the United Nations has warned before the opening of its annual climate change conference.\n\nThe UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report, published on Monday to coincide with the launch of the 30th annual UN Climate Change conference (COP) in Brazil, that weather-related disasters caused about 250 million people to flee their homes over the past decade.\n\nThe migration agency issued its second major report on the effect of climate change on refugees – No Escape II: The Way Forward – in the run-up to COP 30, as it appears that the enthusiasm of countries to agree action to curb climate change continues to ebb.\n\n“Over the past decade, weather-related disasters have caused some 250 million internal displacements – equivalent to over 67,000 displacements per day,” the report said .\n\nThe UNHCR added that climate change is also increasing the difficulties faced by those displaced by conflict and other driving forces.\n\n“Climate change is compounding and multiplying the challenges faced by those who have already been displaced, as well as their hosts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings,” it continued.\n\nFloods in South Sudan and Brazil, record heat in Kenya and Pakistan, and water shortages in Chad and Ethiopia are among the disasters noted in the report.\n\nThe number of countries facing extreme exposure to climate-related hazards is projected to rise from three to 65 by 2040.\n\nThose 65 countries host more than 45 percent of all people currently displaced by conflict, it added.\n\n“Extreme weather is … destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing families – many who have already fled violence – to flee once more,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\n\n“These are people who have already endured immense loss, and now they face the same hardships and devastation again. They are among the hardest hit by severe droughts, deadly floods and record-breaking heatwaves, yet they have the fewest resources to recover,” he said.\n\nBy 2050, the report reads, the hottest 15 refugee camps in the world – in The Gambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Senegal and Mali – are projected to experience nearly 200 days of hazardous heat stress per year.\n\nThe refugee agency’s report emphasised that while the effect of climate change is growing, the commitment towards dealing with it has been weakening.\n\nThe UNHCR hopes to reawaken efforts to fight the effects at the conference in Brazil.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States, traditionally the world’s top donor, has  slashed foreign aid .\n\nWashington previously accounted for more than 40 percent of the UNHCR’s budget. Other major donor countries have also been tightening their belts.\n\n“Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather,” Grandi said.\n\n“To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge,” he said. “This COP must deliver real action, not empty promises.”\n\nAbout 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries will meet in Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, to discuss curbing the climate crisis.\n\nOne topic on the agenda exposing the difficulties of agreeing on global action is the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nThe policy is designed to prevent “carbon leakage” by requiring importers of carbon-intensive goods like steel and cement to pay the same price for embedded emissions that EU producers face domestically.\n\nWhile the EU promotes CBAM as a necessary environmental tool to encourage greener practices, critics of the policy, including major trading partners like the US and China, view it as a veiled act of protectionism.\n\nDeveloping nations, meanwhile, are concerned that it unfairly shifts the financial burden of climate action onto them."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New studies show that mRNA vaccines developed for COVID-19 may enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and attack cancer cells, particularly in aggressive or 'cold' tumors.

rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, marks a pivotal moment in global climate negotiations, focusing on the implementation of past commitments rather than setting new targets.

Nations climate change conference (COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/australia-indonesia-agree-to-upgraded-defence-pact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:24:24+00:00","title":"Australia, Indonesia agree to upgraded defence pact","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia and Indonesia are finalizing a new defence treaty, marking a 'watershed' in their security relationship.

defence pact\n\nAustralia and Indonesia say they are close to signing a “watershed” defence treaty that will upgrade their already close collaboration on security issues.\n\nThe treaty was approved on Wednesday by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Indonesian  President Prabowo Subianto , who is on his first state visit to Australia, although the pact between the two countries will not be officially signed until January.\n\nThe new agreement will commit Australia and Indonesia to “consult at a leader and ministerial level, on a regular basis on matters of security”, the Australian leader said.\n\nIt will also facilitate “mutually beneficial security activities, and if either or both countries’ security is threatened, to consult and consider what measures may be taken, either individually or jointly, to deal with those threats”, Albanese said.\n\n“This treaty is a recognition from both our nations that the best way to secure that peace and stability is by acting together,” he added.\n\n“It signals a new era in the Australia-Indonesia relationship,” he said, adding that the deal committed the two countries to “close cooperation in the defence and security field”.\n\n“Good neighbours will help each other in times of difficulties,” Prabowo said.\n\nWithin Indonesian culture, he added, “we have a saying when we face an emergency, it is our neighbour that will help us”.\n\nToday I stood alongside my friend Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on HMAS Canberra to make an historic announcement.   The governments of Australia and Indonesia have just substantively concluded negotiations on a new bilateral treaty on our common security.   Australia’s…  pic.twitter.com/bI53L7tj8q\n\n— Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP)  November 12, 2025\n\nWhile the text of the treaty has not been made public, Albanese said it is based on a 1995 security agreement signed by then-Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and Indonesian President Soeharto, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.\n\nThe deal was later cancelled by Indonesia due to Australia’s involvement in a United Nations peacekeeping mission to East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was brutally occupied by Indonesia from 1975 to 1999.\n\nSince East Timor’s independence in 2002, relations between Jakarta and Canberra have improved, and they have since signed two important security pacts – the 2006 Lombok Treaty and the 2024 Defence Cooperation Agreement.\n\nThe new treaty builds on the previous agreements and commits both Australia and Indonesia to consult each other if one or both countries believe their security is threatened, and then to consider whether to deal with such threats either “individually or jointly”, Albanese said.\n\nAustralia and Indonesia share longstanding  concerns about the rise of China , which is seen as an important economic partner but also a strategic competitor with a growing military presence in the South China Sea and Pacific region.\n\nKeating, the former Australian premier, told ABC News last year that even 30 years ago, he and Soeharto were worried about Beijing.\n\n“Soeharto and my arrangement was essentially a mutual defence pact. Because a major threat to one, given the geography, necessarily impacted on the other, or had consequences for the other or would have had consequences,” he said, according to ABC News.\n\n“Soeharto was substantially worried about a future rising China and so was I. But even then, 30 years ago, he worried about Indonesia’s incapacity to protect its sprawling archipelago against a competent force,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with cases reported across all provinces and territories, leading to 5,000 confirmed cases and two deaths.

Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/colombias-petro-halts-intelligence-sharing-with-us-over-caribbean-strikes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:04:29+00:00","title":"Colombia’s Petro halts intelligence sharing with US over Caribbean strikes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombian President Gustavo Petro has suspended all intelligence sharing with US security agencies in response to ongoing missile attacks on boats in the Caribbean, which the US claims target drug trafficking vessels.

Petro halts intelligence sharing with US over Caribbean strikes\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has ordered a halt to intelligence sharing with United States security agencies as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to launch missiles at boats in the Caribbean.\n\n“An order has been given at all levels of the public security force’s intelligence services to suspend communications and other dealings with US security agencies,” Petro said on X on Tuesday, adding that the suspension “will remain in force as long as the missile attacks on boats continue”.\n\nThe Colombian leader also shared a post with unconfirmed media reports that the United Kingdom has made a move similar to Bogota’s over  legal concerns  related to the ongoing US attacks that have so far killed at least 75 people.\n\nPetro has called for Trump to be investigated for war crimes over the strikes, which the US says are targeting drug boats and which have affected citizens of Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe leftist leader has long been a critic of US drug policy and has accused the Trump administration of going after peasants growing coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, instead of targeting major drug traffickers and money launderers.\n\nOn Sunday, Petro said he met with the family of a Colombian fisherman who was allegedly killed in one of the strikes.\n\n“He may have been carrying fish, or he may have been carrying cocaine, but he had not been sentenced to death,” Petro said during a summit between Latin American and European Union leaders hosted by Colombia on Sunday. “There was no need to murder him.”\n\nThe Trump administration has accused Petro of being soft on traffickers and has criticised the Colombian president’s decision to spare Colombian rebel leaders involved in the drug trade from extradition to the US.\n\nThis is also not the first time that Trump and Petro have clashed. In September, the Colombian president left the US within hours of Washington  revoking his visa  for what it said were his “reckless and incendiary actions” while in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nEarlier in the day, Petro had addressed a crowd protesting against Israel’s war on Gaza outside UN headquarters, where he called on US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump” and “obey the orders of humanity”.\n\nResponding to his visa being taken away, he said: “Revoking it for denouncing genocide shows the US no longer respects international law.”\n\nMore recently, the US Department of the Treasury  imposed sanctions  on Petro, his family and the South American country’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti, accusing him of failing to rein in Colombia’s cocaine industry and of shielding criminal groups from accountability.\n\nPetro’s announcement on Tuesday came as a US aircraft carrier arrived in the Caribbean Sea, fuelling speculation the Trump administration is considering escalating its military action in the region, which has primarily targeted the government of Venezuelan President  Nicolas Maduro , a longtime US rival.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that the Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group, which includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with at least 4,000 sailors and “tactical aircraft” on board.\n\nSe da orden a todos los niveles de la inteligencia de la fuerza pública suspender envío de comunicaciones y otros tratos con agencias de seguridad estadounidenses.

stretch resources in poverty-stricken areas in the east and north, according to the United Nations.\n\nTaliban-controlled Afghanistan – battered by  aid cuts , sanctions and repeated natural disasters, including a  deadly quake in August  – is struggling to absorb 4.5 million people who have returned since 2023. About 1.5 million were forced back this year from Pakistan and Iran, which have  intensified efforts to expel  Afghan refugees.\n\nA UN Development Programme (UNDP) report released on Wednesday said returning Afghans are reeling from severe economic insecurity. More than half of returnee households are skipping medical care to afford food while more than 90 percent have taken on debt, the report said.\n\nTheir debts range from $373 to $900 when the average monthly income is $100, according to the report, whose findings were based on a survey of more than 48,000 households.\n\nReturnees are also struggling to find decent housing as rent prices have tripled. More than half report lacking sufficient space or bedding while 18 percent report having been displaced for a second time in the past year. In western Afghanistan’s Injil and Guzara districts, “most returnees live in tents or degraded structures,” the report says.\n\nThe UNDP called for urgent support to strengthen Afghans’ livelihoods and services in high-return areas.\n\n“Area-based recovery works,” said Stephen Rodriques, UNDP resident representative in Afghanistan. “By linking income opportunities, basic services, housing and social cohesion, it is possible to ease pressure on high-return districts and reduce the risk of secondary displacement.”\n\nAid for Afghanistan, still reeling from the impact of decades of war before the  United States’s withdrawal in 2021 , has plummeted, and donor countries have failed to meet the $3.1bn the UN sought for Afghanistan this year.\n\nThe Taliban government appealed for international humanitarian assistance after this year’s earthquake, and it has formally protested against Pakistan’s mass expulsion of Afghan nationals, saying it is “deeply concerned” about their treatment.\n\nThe UNDP also warned that limited economic opportunities for women in Afghanistan are exacerbating the plight of returnees, who more frequently rely on female breadwinners.\n\nParticipation by women in Afghanistan’s labour force has fallen to 6 percent, one of the lowest globally, and restrictions on their movement have made it nearly impossible for women who head households to access jobs, education or healthcare, the agency said.\n\n“Afghanistan’s returnee and host communities are under immense strain,” said Kanni Wignaraja, UN assistant secretary-general and UNDP regional director for Asia and the Pacific. “In some provinces, one in four households depend on women as the main breadwinner, so when women are prevented from working, families, communities, the country lose out.”\n\n“Cutting women out of the front-line teams means cutting off vital services for those who need them most, including returnees and victims of natural disasters,” she added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/russia-loses-legal-battle-to-build-embassy-near-australias-parliament","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:19:58+00:00","title":"Russia loses legal battle to build embassy near Australia’s Parliament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia’s High Court has ruled in favor of the government in a legal battle over the Russian embassy lease, confirming that the cancellation of the lease — granted in 2008 and revoked in 2023 due to national security concerns identified by ASIO — was a valid exercise of legislative power under the Australian Constitution.

nation’s top court ruling that Canberra acted within its rights when it cancelled the lease for the site.\n\nAustralia passed legislation in 2023 to mothball the planned embassy building after officials deemed it to pose a security threat.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at the time that his government decided to revoke the lease over the “specific risk” posed by the site, located about 300 metres (328 yards) from Parliament House.\n\nRussia, which blasted the move as “Russophobic hysteria”, challenged the legislation in court, arguing that it was not valid under the Australian Constitution.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling on Wednesday, the High Court found that the cancellation of the lease had been a “valid exercise of the legislative power” to enact laws related to the acquisition of property.\n\nThe court, however, ruled that Russia was entitled to compensation after paying about $2m for the 99-year lease in 2008.\n\nThe court previously rejected a bid by Moscow to stop its officials from being evicted from the site.\n\nThe government introduced new legislation on June 15 to end the Russian lease on the land after intelligence agencies warned the location was a risk to national security.\n\nIn a statement following the ruling, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said, “Australia will always stand up for our values and we will stand up for our national security.”\n\n“The government welcomes the High Court’s decision that found the government acted lawfully in terminating the Russian Embassy’s lease,” Rowland said in a statement.\n\n“The government will closely consider the next steps in light of the court’s decision,” Rowland added.\n\nThe Russian embassy said it was studying the judgement, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.\n\n“The Russian side will carefully study the text of the court ruling, which sets a precedent,” an embassy official said in a statement.\n\nRelations between Australia and Russia have been strained for years.\n\nTies deteriorated sharply after the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which multiple investigations blamed on pro-Russian separatists, and then plunged further after

2025-11-12T04:16:29+00:00\n\nTitle: Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:12:47+00:00","title":"California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom criticizes the Trump administration’s absence from the event as a failure of leadership and a breach of climate responsibility.

California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/thousands-evacuated-in-taiwan-as-tropical-storm-fung-wong-closes-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:05:16+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuated in Taiwan as Tropical Storm Fung-wong closes in","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"More than 3,300 people in Taiwan have been evacuated as Tropical Storm Fung-Wong, downgraded from a super typhoon, approaches the island.

luxury property, and other assets now worth about 4.8 billion British pounds ($6.3bn).\n\nZhimin Qian, 47, was sentenced by the Southwark Crown Court in London on Tuesday, in a case that saw UK police seize a record-breaking 61,000 Bitcoin as part of their investigation.\n\nQian, who is also known by the alias Yadi Zhang, was found guilty of money laundering and possessing illegally obtained cryptocurrency.\n\nWill Lyne, the Metropolitan Police’s head of Economic and Cybercrime Command, described the case as “one of the largest and most complex economic crime investigations ever undertaken by the Met”.\n\n“This is currently the largest cryptocurrency seizure by law enforcement in the UK and is the largest money laundering case in UK history by value,” he said in a statement.\n\nUK authorities allege that Qian helped mastermind an investment scam in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded 128,000 people out of roughly £4.6bn, according to sentencing remarks from Judge Sally-Ann Hales.\n\nMuch of the funds were later recovered by police in China, but Hales said that a “sizeable amount was siphoned off and used by” Qian, and transferred into 70,000 Bitcoin stored on a laptop wallet.\n\nQian fled China in 2017, spending the next seven years on the run, and travelling between the UK and other countries without an extradition agreement with China.\n\nQian and an accomplice, who has since been sentenced, came to the attention of UK authorities in 2018, when Qian tried to buy three London properties worth 40.5 million pounds ($53.2m) but failed “know your customer” regulations, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nQian disappeared from the UK in 2020, but not before police seized items from a safe deposit box, including a laptop smuggled from China.\n\nHales said that documents found during the search “give an indication of the level of the defendant’s monthly expenditure, and the grandiose ambitions she held for her future using the proceeds of her criminal conduct”.\n\nQian returned to police attention last year, when she began to use a dormant wallet with the help of a second accomplice, Senghok Ling, 47, a Malaysian national based in the UK.\n\nWhen police arrested Ling and Qian in April 2024, the pair was living a “lavish” lifestyle in the UK, according to Hales. At the time, Qian was found in possession of 62 million pounds ($81.4m) worth of cryptocurrency, a large quantity of cash, and two false passports.\n\nLing was separately sentenced to four years and 11 months in prison.\n\nRichard Hermer, Attorney General for the UK and Wales, on Tuesday praised the sentencing of “two prolific fraudsters”, who together “caused misery upon thousands of victims to fund their lavish lifestyles”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/turkiye-confirms-all-20-soldiers-died-in-its-army-plane-crash-in-georgia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:54:38Z","title":"Turkiye confirms all 20 soldiers died in its army plane crash in Georgia","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish C-130 military cargo aircraft crashed in Georgia near the border with Azerbaijan, killing all 20 personnel on board.

According to official figures, at least 12 people were killed and more than 30 were injured, several of them critically, when the  bomber blew himself up  at the entrance of the court complex.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif blamed “ India-backed proxies ” operating from Afghanistan for carrying out the attack.\n\nIndia, where a car explosion on Monday evening killed at least 13 people, said it “unequivocally” rejects the “baseless and unfounded allegations being made by an obviously delirious Pakistani leadership”.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday evening, Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said Islamabad was attempting to “deflect the attention of its own public from the ongoing military-inspired constitutional subversion and power-grab unfolding within the country”, appearing to refer to the 27th constitutional amendment being debated in Pakistan’s National Assembly.\n\n“The international community is well aware of the reality, and will not be misled by Pakistan’s desperate diversionary ploys,” Jaiswal added.\n\nThe constitutional amendment has led to criticism from activists, sitting judges and opposition parties for granting lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution for the country’s senior-most military officers, and for setting up a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, which many fear could undermine the Supreme Court.\n\nBut on Tuesday, it was the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad that was shaken, as the impact blast there reverberated across South Asia.\n\nThe sound of the explosion was heard in nearby residential areas and office buildings. Soon after, videos of the incident went viral on social media, showing flames and plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle near a security barrier at the compound’s entrance.\n\nIn other clips, lawyers were seen rushing out to help those on the road as security personnel surrounded the premises.\n\nWitnesses said, at the time of the blast, nearly 2,000 people were inside the complex, including judges, lawyers, litigants and court staff.\n\nThey described an explosion so powerful that windows in several courtrooms were shattered, and body parts were strewn across the site, including the head of the suicide bomber.\n\nWith different gates for entry and exit, and the main gate closed immediately after the blast, police initially instructed people to stay inside before allowing them to leave about 25 minutes later.\n\nMuhammad Shehzad Butt, a 52-year-old lawyer, was among them. He said he had been heading towards the cafeteria when the explosion occurred.\n\n“It was utter pandemonium, and in the panic, most of the people were trying to exit the complex, causing havoc at the gate, while many others tried to get back inside the building,” he told Al Jazeera outside the complex.\n\nAfter the attack, authorities cordoned off the area, placing barriers to keep the media from entering or approaching the site where the suicide bomber detonated the explosives.\n\nA large number of journalists gathered outside the compound, hoping to capture visuals, but officials initially denied them access.\n\nBy then, most litigants had left, though some lawyers lingered nearby, speaking with reporters and YouTube vloggers recording their accounts.\n\nButt, the lawyer, said when he arrived at court in the morning, security checks appeared routine but thorough. However, he heard from colleagues that there was an additional layer of screening that day.\n\nThis was corroborated by Khalid, the lawyer from Quetta who has worked in Islamabad for the past five years.\n\n“This morning, when Fawad and I reached the court premises, we had to wait slightly longer as there was extra checking at the entrance. There was no concern, but we just felt that maybe some VIP might be visiting the court or some delegation,” he said.\n\nDespite the dozen people killed, including one lawyer, both Khalid and Fawad, who is originally from Swat, said they felt no fear about returning to work the next day.\n\n“We have seen enough of this [violence],” Khalid said. “These things don’t scare us.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, a co-discoverer of the DNA double helix and recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine, has died at the age of 97.

pull back under fierce Russian pressure in Zaporizhia\n\nUkraine’s top military commander has conceded that the army’s situation has “ significantly worsened ” in parts of the southern Zaporizhia region, where Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from five villages after intense fighting against Russian troops.\n\nNews of the setback in Zaporizhia in southeastern Ukraine comes as Russia said earlier on Tuesday that its forces had pushed deeper into the eastern  Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk  and Kupiansk.\n\nVideo footage published by Russian war bloggers shows Moscow’s troops riding motorcycles, travelling in battered cars and sitting on top of military vehicles as they poured into Pokrovsk, which Russian media has dubbed “the gateway to Donetsk” due to its strategic location.\n\n“Using its numerical superiority in personnel and materiel, the enemy advanced in fierce fighting and captured three settlements,” the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Syrskii, said of the fighting in Zaporizhia on Tuesday.\n\n“The situation has significantly worsened in the Oleksandrivka and Huliapole directions,” Syrskii said in a statement.\n\nThe Ukrainian Army said earlier that orders to withdraw from five villages in Zaporizhia were given after the “de facto destruction of all shelters and fortifications” following intensive Russian artillery strikes. An estimated 2,000 shells were launched at the Ukrainian positions.\n\nControl of three other villages is also being hotly contested between Russian and Ukrainian forces northeast of the town of Huliapole in Zaporizhia, according to the Ukrainian Army.\n\nSyrskii said that Russian forces in Zaporizhia had used  poor weather conditions  to their advantage, advancing under heavy fog to infiltrate between Ukrainian positions in the region. But he added that Russian forces suffered heavy losses during their attacks.\n\n“Every metre of our land costs Russia hundreds of military lives,” he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was visiting the parts of the southern Kherson region not occupied by Russia on Tuesday, described the situation in Pokrovsk and Zaporizhia as “difficult, in part because of weather conditions that favour the attacks”.\n\nThe battlefield situation in Kupiansk was “somewhat easier”, he said, adding that Ukrainian forces had “achieved results there”.\n\nRussia has been threatening Pokrovsk for more than a year, using a pincer movement to attempt to encircle it and threaten supply lines.\n\nSyrskii told US media that Russia has concentrated an estimated 150,000 troops in a drive to take Pokrovsk.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have given conflicting accounts of the battle in recent days, with Moscow claiming for days that it had encircled Pokrovsk, while Kyiv has denied the claims and asserted that it still had supply lines to neighbouring Myrnohrad.\n\nRussia also said its forces have taken full control of the eastern part of Kupiansk in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, located to the northeast of Zaporizhia and Pokrovsk.\n\nA Russian commander, who gave his call sign as Hunter, said his forces had taken control of an oil depot on Kupiansk’s eastern edge. In a video statement issued by Russia’s Ministry of Defence, the commander said his forces had also taken control of a series of train stops south of Kupiansk.\n\nMilitary observers have noted a thinning of Ukraine’s front lines due to a severe shortage of soldiers and massive Russian drone superiority, which has led to advances in several locations along the front line in the more than  three and a half years of war ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar comet ever detected, which entered our solar system in 2025 and passed near Mars in October.

comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has expanded its social media ban for children under 16 to include Reddit and Kick, alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, with the ban set to take effect on December 10, 2025.

for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1111-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00-11:59","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from

A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkypezze8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:40:28.449+00:00","title":"US aircraft carrier group arrives near Latin America","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US naval strike force, centered on the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean under orders from President Donald Trump, marking a significant escalation in US military presence in Latin America.

.\n\nPetro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.\n\nHe wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".\n\nIn a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command

in Australia \n\nScientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to \"drop crocs\" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below.\n\nThe discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\n\nThe egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America.\n\nCo-author Prof Michael Archer said \"drop crocs\" were a \"bizarre idea\" but some were \"perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner\".\n\nProf Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago.\n\nThe \"drop croc\" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain.\n\n\"It's a bizarre idea,\" Prof Archer said of the \"drop crocs\",  but some were probably \"terrestrial hunters in the forests\".\n\nThe findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland.\n\n\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" Prof Archer said.\n\nSince the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane.\n\nOver the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest.\n\n\"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said.\n\nProf Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague \"drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard\".\n\n\"After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'.\n\n\"And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How

nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8912d7jxl2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:16:47.999+00:00","title":"Hamas fighters trapped in tunnels present new obstacle to Gaza ceasefire progress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas fighters are believed to be trapped in tunnels beneath Rafah, behind the 'Yellow Line' demarcation, presenting a new obstacle to progress in ceasefire negotiations.

progress\n\nUS President Donald Trump's envoy and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned to Israel on Monday, as mediators face a new obstacle in their efforts to advance negotiations on the fragile Gaza ceasefire deal to the next and more complex phase.\n\nKey sticking points remain unresolved, including Hamas's disarmament, the reconstruction and future governance of Gaza, and the deployment of an international security force to the territory.\n\nWithout a timeline for the discussions, which are likely to require significant concessions from both Israel and Hamas, there are doubts that any progress can be achieved.\n\nAnother challenge has emerged recently, involving scores of Hamas fighters believed to be in tunnels beneath the southern city of Rafah behind the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which marks the area under Israeli control.\n\nLast week, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said an amnesty could be offered for fighters who laid down their arms, and that this could be a \"model\" for what Washington hoped to apply in the rest of Gaza.\n\nWitkoff said 200 fighters were trapped, although this number has not been confirmed.\n\nAccording to media reports, Kushner and the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the issue during a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday.\n\nHamas has previously said the fighters will not surrender and demanded that they are given safe passage, which has so far been rejected by Israel.\n\nAn Israeli government spokeswoman said Netanyahu and Kushner had \"discussed phase one, which we are currently still in, to bring our remaining hostages, and the future of phase two of this plan, which includes the disarming of Hamas, demilitarising Gaza, and ensuring Hamas will have no role in the future of Gaza ever again\".\n\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nSince then, more than 69,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire, which came into force last month, focused on halting the war, returning all hostages, and securing a surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nTwenty living hostages and the remains of 24 deceased captives have been released, with four bodies remaining in Gaza.\n\nIn return, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners from its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza who were being held without charge or trial. It has also handed over the remains of 315 Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce, with Israel saying Hamas has deliberately delayed the return of the remains of hostages and Hamas saying that Israel has killed at least 240 Palestinians and is restricting the entry of aid supplies.\n\nHamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established. Israel refuses any involvement in the governance of Gaza by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which is the body that governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Countries are reluctant to commit troops to the multinational force without clear goals, concerned that their soldiers might end up confronting fighters from Hamas and other Palestinian factions.\n\nThe Israeli military currently occupies 53% of Gaza's territory and is expected to withdraw further in the next stage of the plan.\n\nWith no indication of imminent advances in the negotiations,  a de-facto partition of Gaza between the area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas was increasingly likely, sources told the Reuters news agency , with talks about reconstruction apparently likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled territory.\n\nArab countries have already expressed concerns that the current separation could become a permanent partition of Gaza.\n\nThe Trump plan does not include a pathway to Palestinian statehood - a concept which Israel rejects."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:04:20.736+00:00","title":"Starbucks' barista strike could undermine its turnaround plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks is facing a major barista strike led by the union Starbucks Workers United, which calls for better pay, staffing, and working conditions amid ongoing tensions since the company's leadership under Brian Niccol introduced a 'Back to Starbucks' turnaround strategy.

turnaround plan\n\nStarbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes.\n\nBut though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround.\n\nPicket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday,   as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing.\n\nThe walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago.\n\nBaristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload.\n\n\"Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,\" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US.\n\n\"You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,\" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May.\n\nStarbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the \"vast majority\" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US.\n\nBut the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment.\n\nIn recent years the brand has faced   consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks.\n\nThe arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%.\n\nHe quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal.\n\nAt the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training.\n\nProgress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat.\n\n\"We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,\" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts.\n\nBut the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester.\n\nStarbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September.\n\nEven after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice.\n\nA union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April.\n\nThe company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would \"significantly affect store operations and customer experience\", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week.\n\n\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement.\n\n\"Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,\" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30.\n\nUnionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months.\n\nThis continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts.\n\nThe brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers.\n\n\"Happy customers have to come from happy employees,\" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. \"You can't do that top down.\"\n\nThis week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of \"union-busting\" and urging the company to bargain in good faith.\n\nJoe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the \"Experience Economy\", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was \"surprised\" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved.\n\n\"This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n43emvejo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"03:27:44.652+00:00","title":"Australia's top spy accuses China of targeting its critical infrastructure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia's spy chief, Mike Burgess, has publicly accused Chinese state-linked hacking groups — Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon — of targeting the country’s critical infrastructure, including telecommunications, water, transport, and energy networks.

targeting its critical infrastructure\n\nAustralia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of \"high-impact sabotage\".\n\nMike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said \"unprecedented levels of espionage\" meant a growing threat of \"cyber-enabled sabotage\" in the next five years.\n\nHe singled out \"one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia\" and its allies, \"targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks\".\n\nThe Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes were now more willing to \"disrupt and destroy,\" Burgess warned.\n\nHe cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon,  who have targeted telecommunications companies in the US  and Australia.\n\n\"These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,\" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday.\n\n\"Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure.\"\n\nHe said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US.\n\n\"And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,\" Burgess said.\n\nHe said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage.\n\n\"And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,\" Burgess said.\n\nHe warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to \"impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord\".\n\n\"I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,\" he said.\n\nBurgess pointed out that  short telecommunication outages , unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society.\n\n\"That's one phone network not working for less than one day,\" he said.\n\n\"Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?\"\n\nSpies are increasingly \"broadening their collection requirements\", Burgess said.\n\n\"They are aggressively targeting private sector projects, negotiations and investments that might give foreign companies a commercial advantage. And like criminals, they have been aggressively targeting customer data.\"\n\nThe spy chief said conservative estimates showed that espionage cost Australia A$12.5bn ($8.2bn; £6.2bn) in 2023-24, with about $2bn worth of trade secrets and intellectual property stolen from Australian companies in one year.\n\nBurgess described the hackers' abilities as \"highly sophisticated, using top-notch tradecraft to find your networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks\".\n\n\"And when they have penetrated your networks, they actively and aggressively map your systems, and seek to maintain persistent undetected access that enables them to conduct sabotage at a time and moment of their choosing.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0z2q2g2ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"08:14:49.707+00:00","title":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer will fight any attempt to replace him, friends say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces increasing internal pressure from Labour MPs to step down, with potential challengers including Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood, Ed Miliband, and Louise Haigh.

to his leadership from Labour MPs.\n\nThere are fears from those loyal to Sir Keir Starmer that his job might be under immediate threat, perhaps as soon as shortly after the Budget in a fortnight's time.\n\nCritics say it is evidence that Downing Street is \"in full bunker mode\" which \"won't help the government out of the hole we're in.\"\n\nFriends of Sir Keir are deeply worried about what they see as plotting going on to try to replace him and are seeking to make clear what they see as the grave risks of a leadership challenge.\n\nThose names being discussed by Labour MPs as potential candidates to displace Sir Keir include some of his closest cabinet allies, especially Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.\n\nSome also speculate about the ambitions of Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and backbenchers including the former transport secretary Louise Haigh.\n\nThe ambition of Streeting is seen with particular suspicion from some loyal to the prime minister.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Streeting called suggestions he would challenge Sir Keir \"self-defeating nonsense\", and said he was not standing against the prime minister.\n\nAsked if he would ever consider making such a move, he replied: \"I cannot see circumstances under which I would do that to our prime minister.\"\n\nHe said the prime minister should sack the aide who was responsible for the briefing, which he described as \"the worst attack on a faithful since Joe Marler was banished in The Traitors final\".\n\nHe added that there was a \"toxic culture\" in Downing Street that needed to change.\n\nOne minister said: \"He [the prime minister] will fight this,\" before making reference to a key by-election in 2021 which Labour lost to the Conservatives, prompting Sir Keir to consider resigning as Labour's leader.\n\n\"This is not a Hartlepool moment,\" they added.\n\n\"He is one of only two people alive who have won a general election for Labour. It'd be madness to run against him after 17 months.\"\n\nOpinion  polls suggest  Sir Keir is deeply unpopular, perhaps even the  most unpopular British prime minister  in the history of modern opinion polling.\n\nPolls also suggest the Labour Party has commanded the support of  no more than a fifth of the electorate  in recent months.\n\nBut, a move to replace Sir Keir isn't straightforward. Under Labour's rules, it would take 20% of its MPs to nominate a challenger - 81 given the current size of the parliamentary party in the Commons.\n\nFor months now, plenty in the Labour Party have acknowledged that the government faces a likely crunch point after devolved elections in Scotland and Wales and local elections in many parts of England next May.\n\nLabour is widely expected to do badly in those elections, but there are growing concerns from some in the party that it can't wait until then to contemplate a change of leader.\n\nDowning Street is aware of the potential imminence of such a threat to them.\n\nOne senior Labour MP told us: \"It's all very well to say wait for the locals, but that's my activist base I'm sending into the gunfire. I can't lose all my councillors.\"\n\nAnother Labour source said: \"The list of reasons for people to move after the Budget are growing by the day.\n\n\"If Wes is brave and moves he may well be rewarded by being prime minister by Christmas.\"\n\nA government source said Downing Street \"has gone into full bunker mode, turning on their most loyal cabinet members for absolutely no reason\".\n\n\"Unfortunately there is a pattern of Keir's team briefing against his own people - they did it to Angela, Lisa, Lucy, now it's Wes's turn,\" the source added.\n\n\"A circular firing squad won't help the government out of the hole we're in,\" a government source said - referring to the former and current deputy leaders, Angela Rayner and Lucy Powell respectively, and the Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy.\n\nLabour peer Maurice Glasman told BBC Two's Newsnight he couldn't see any candidate who could possibly challenge Sir Keir, saying the leadership chatter was \"just noise\".\n\n\"There isn't a clear direction, there isn't a clear strategy... none of the candidates challenging Keir have any idea either,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if Mahmood would be up to the task of addressing the issues facing Labour, Lord Glasman said: \"For me, absolutely. I mean, she's the only one of really genuine quality of the whole lot, but she's got a job to do.\"\n\nHe added that he fully supports the prime minister and was not in favour of any challenge to his leadership.\n\nThe prime minister's supporters are telling Labour MPs they should be careful what they wish for.\n\nThey argue a leadership contest would plunge the party into the chaos associated with the final years of the Conservative Party's stint in office which came to an end last year, and install a leader who does not have their own mandate from the country.\n\nThey are trying to convince their colleagues that a contest could destabilise the international markets too, and would jeopardise the good relationship the prime minister has established with President Trump.\n\nBut others, including some ministers, fret about what they perceive to be the desperate position the government is in.\n\n\"It's terrible. He [Starmer] is hated out there. It is worse than it got under Corbyn. I don't see how this is sustainable until May,\" one minister said.\n\nA cabinet minister who is supportive of the prime minister sums up the mood among their colleagues as they see it: \"There are those who see it as a choice between this Labour government and perfection.\n\n\"The closer they can nudge us towards the policies they see as perfect, the happier they are.\n\n\"But the choice isn't between us and perfection, it's between us and Reform.\"\n\nThe rise of Reform UK has concentrated minds in Downing Street in recent months.\n\nThe prime minister sees Labour's battle with Reform leader Nigel Farage as generation-defining – and the prospect of losing to Reform at a general election as vastly worse than Labour losses to the Conservatives.\n\nHe believes he has the energy and wherewithal to take on and defeat Farage.\n\nBut a growing number of his colleagues are not convinced.\n\n\"We are not like the Tories. We're not going to change leader more than once in a parliament,\" one Labour MP first elected last year told us.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e2lnvgpgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:48:20.701+00:00","title":"Mali fuel blockade: How jihadists have paralysed an entire country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sustained fuel blockade in Mali, driven by attacks from the jihadist group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), has paralysed daily life for over two months.

country\n\nIn Bamako, Mali's capital city, the familiar sounds of car engines and horns have been replaced by those of shuffling feet.\n\nResidents push depleted motorcycles through the city's dusty roads, frustrated by the fuel blockade that has paralysed Mali for more than two months.\n\nJama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) , a jihadist, al-Qaeda-affiliated militia, has been attacking tankers bringing fuel into Mali, broadening its years-long insurgency to include economic warfare.\n\nJNIM's fighters have kidnapped drivers and torched more than 100 trucks bound for Bamako.\n\nDaily life has been upended for millions of Malians - schools and universities had to close, food prices have surged and hospitals are battling power cuts.\n\nThe fuel shortage has sparked concern outside of Mali, with the US urging Americans not to travel to Mali and France advising its citizens in the West African country to leave as soon as possible.\n\nOne defining image of the crisis is lengthy queues building up outside petrol stations.\n\n\"We're here waiting for fuel, and we've been here for more than four days now,\" Sidi Djiré, a taxi driver waiting at a petrol station in Bamako, tells the BBC.\n\nMr Djiré says he hopes Mali's military-led government solves the crisis soon, because \"whether you're a vendor or a teacher, everyone's work has been affected\".\n\nAt some forecourts in Bamako, motorists are met by a note bearing three, exasperating words - \"no fuel today\".\n\nMany delivery and bus drivers have resorted to sleeping at petrol stations in the hope of being the first to refuel once supplies come in.\n\nAnd with public transport fares tripling in some parts of the capital, some passengers have ditched the bus completely and are walking long distances to work.\n\nAt Bamako's Baco Djicoroni market, customer Assitan Diarra says that food prices have tripled.\n\n\"Times are really tough right now. But what can we do? We are at war. We pray that God brings ease and peace to our country,\" Ms Diarra says.\n\nTraders tell the BBC prices have increased because transport costs have surged and the supply of imported goods has dwindled.\n\n\"The goods we used to get easily are no longer easily accessible due to the lack of transportation. For those of us who sell food products, the fuel shortage makes access to supplies difficult,\" Amadou Traoré says.\n\nBehind the chaos appears to be a carefully orchestrated plan.\n\nThe junta had popular support when it seized power five years ago, promising to deal with the long-running security crisis, prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north, which was then hijacked by Islamist militants like JNIM.\n\nBut the Islamist insurgency has continued, and has made much of the north and east of the country ungovernable.\n\nJNIM has intensified its attacks in this area over the past year, and the fuel blockade marks a significant escalation from its usual hit-and-run ambushes.\n\nMali is landlocked, so fuel supplies must be brought in by road from neighbouring states, such as Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nBy cutting off fuel - the lifeblood of transport, electricity, and logistics - JNIM is forcing the government into a defensive position.\n\nThe blockade also points to the geographic expansion of its insurgency, as JNIM's fighters are targeting highways linking Mali to its neighbours to the west and south.\n\nThe fuel has had a large impact on hospitals - diesel shortages mean many health facilities cannot run generators for long and therefore experience power cuts that threaten emergency services.\n\nAt   Kalaban Coro Health Centre, medics are even struggling to show up for their shifts.\n\n\"Our personnel must be prompt and punctual in reporting to duty, but it has become extremely difficult for them to secure fuel just to commute to work,\" Dr Issa Guido tells the BBC.\n\nCommuting has also been a problem for teachers and students. As a result, schools and universities were ordered to shut for two weeks. They reopened on Monday, but staff in some rural areas still reportedly failed to travel to work.\n\nThe havoc has touched millions of lives - and Malians are quietly raising questions about the government's capacity to respond.\n\nIn an attempt to ease the crisis, the junta had announced a series of emergency measures.\n\nArmy trucks loaded with soldiers have been escorting fuel convoys from the borders to the capital, however, the operations are fraught with security risks and some of convoys have been attacked regardless of the army's presence.\n\nThe government has also signed an emergency fuel supply agreement with Russia, reports say.\n\nState media says Bamako is negotiating with Moscow for both refined petroleum imports and technical assistance to secure transport routes.\n\nOfficials insist the situation is under control, but critics accuse the junta of being reactive, rather than proactive.\n\nThe fuel shortage is a double-edged sword for the government, headed by coup leader Colonel Assimi Goïta.\n\nOn one hand, his regime can portray itself as a victim of jihadism, rallying nationalistic support and justifying tighter security measures.\n\nOn the other, the blockade has exposed the government's weakening reach beyond Bamako and undermined public confidence in a regime that came to power promising to tackle jihadism.\n\nThe fuel shortage has also increased the country's reliance on Russia.\n\nMercenary groups from Russia have supported Col Goïta's government since  French and UN troops left , and further dependence could draw Mali further into Moscow's sphere of influence, potentially alienating Western aid and investment.\n\nRelations with the US and European Union are already strained, while ties with France have virtually been severed.\n\nBut for ordinary Malians, geopolitics mean little when you are faced with unaffordable food prices and cannot get to work.\n\nAmidou Diallo, a welder who has been fruitlessly searching for fuel for his generator, fears the shortages could lead to an increase in crime and a worsened security situation.\n\n\"We're facing a crisis,\" he tells the BBC. \"If it continues like this, other problems may arise - and that could give people dangerous ideas.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d5m54350o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"08:57:01.930+00:00","title":"Trump says he has 'obligation' to sue BBC over speech edit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump has stated he has an 'obligation' to sue the BBC over the editing of his January 6, 2021 speech in a Panorama documentary, claiming it was 'butchered' and misrepresented his position on the Capitol riot.

of his speech was edited in a Panorama documentary.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, he said his 6 January 2021 speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.\n\nIt is the first time Trump has spoken publicly about the matter since his lawyers wrote to the BBC and said he would sue for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him.\n\nA spokesperson for the BBC said: \"We are reviewing the letter and will respond directly in due course.\"\n\nBBC chair Samir Shah has previously apologised for an \"error of judgement\" over the edit.\n\nAppearing on Fox News's The Ingraham Angle, the president was asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, responding \"well I guess I have to, you know, why not, because they defrauded the public, and they've admitted it\".\n\nTrump continued: \"They actually changed my January 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech, and they made it sound radical.\n\n\"And they actually changed it. What they did was rather incredible.\"\n\nAsked again if he would proceed with the legal action, he said: \"Well I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that.\"\n\nThe Fox News interview was recorded on Monday, though the section concerning the BBC was not published by Fox News until late on Tuesday evening in the US.\n\nThe BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".\n\nIt sets a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday for the corporation to respond.\n\nThe BBC has said it will respond in due course.\n\nBBC News has contacted the BBC for comment on the president's latest remarks.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has made legal threats against other media outlets over their coverage of him. He settled with both CBS News and ABC News after receiving large payouts, and has sought to take legal action against the New York Times.\n\nThe BBC edit appeared in a Panorama documentary which aired days before the US presidential election in November 2024, but only generated significant public scrutiny after a leaked internal BBC memo was published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper last week.\n\nIn the memo, a former independent external adviser to the BBC's editorial standards committee raised concerns that a section of the speech had been edited in a way which suggested the president explicitly encouraged the Capitol riot of January 2021.\n\nTrump actually said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nHowever, in the Panorama edit two sections of the speech more than 50 minutes apart were spliced together.\n\nHe was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nThe fallout has led to the BBC's director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigning.\n\nBoth  outgoing senior leaders have pushed back against critics  who have said the episode raises wider questions about impartiality at the BBC.\n\nSpeaking during an internal all-staff meeting on Tuesday, Davie said: \"We have made some mistakes that have cost us, but we need to fight\", adding that \"this narrative will not just be given by our enemies, it's our narrative\".\n\nHe said the BBC went through \"difficult times… but it just does good work, and that speaks louder than any newspaper, any weaponisation\".\n\nNeither Davie nor the BBC chair mentioned Trump's legal threat during their address to staff on Tuesday.\n\nDowning Street has said this was a \"matter for the BBC\".\n\n\"It is clearly not for the government to comment on any ongoing legal matters,\" the prime minister's official spokesperson said.\n\nThe row comes at a sensitive time for the BBC, with its royal charter - the agreement which underpins its governance and funding arrangements - due to expire at the end of 2027.\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy will oversee talks on the terms of its renewal. She  told the Commons on Tuesday those negotiations  would \"renew its mission for the modern age\" and ensure a \"genuinely accountable\" organisation.\n\nNandy continued: \"There is a fundamental difference between raising serious concerns over editorial failings and members of this House launching a sustained attack on the institution itself, because the BBC is not just a broadcaster, it is a national institution that belongs to us all.\"\n\nThe culture select committee is expected to hear evidence from senior BBC figures in the coming weeks, including Shah and board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson.\n\nFormer editorial standards adviser Michael Prescott, who authored the leaked memo which appeared in the Telegraph, will also be invited to give evidence.\n\nElsewhere, an internal Reform UK email seen by BBC News  confirmed the party is ending its co-operation with a documentary commissioned by the broadcaster  about its rise.\n\nThe email says the production team had been given \"unprecedented access\" to senior figures in the party, but that they should now withdraw consent for any footage to be used over the Trump row.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

Roya Karimi on going from child bride to champion\n\nThe woman standing on stage glistens in a crystal-studded bikini.\n\nHer glowing, tanned skin shows off each of her well-defined muscle lines, the result of hours of weight training in the gym.\n\nRoya Karimi's perfectly-applied make-up and hair highlighted blonde wouldn't look out of place in the finals of Miss Universe.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that just 15 years ago, she was a teenage mother in Afghanistan, married off as a child bride, before she escaped to her new life.\n\nNow aged 30, she is one of Europe's top bodybuilders, and will be competing in the World Bodybuilding Championships this week. Her rise has been meteoric – she only took up the sport professionally less than two years ago.\n\nNone of this looked likely when Roya fled Afghanistan with her mother and young son. Back then, she sought refuge in Norway where she made a new life for herself, continuing her education and becoming a nurse, while meeting her new husband, who also bodybuilds.\n\nBodybuilding helped her break free from the mental and social limitations that had been imposed on her for years, she says.\n\n\"Every time I go to the gym, I remember that there was a time in Afghanistan when I wasn't even allowed to exercise freely,\" Roya told BBC News Afghan.\n\nRoya's life story has been one of fighting against restrictive traditions and rebuilding her identity - and trying to inspire women in her home country who face widespread restrictions.\n\nSome of those restrictions existed when Roya lived in Afghanistan - a result of social norms. But they have got worse since 2021, when the Taliban returned to power. Now, women in Afghanistan are banned from attending school beyond the age of 12, getting most jobs, unable to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and required not to raise their voices in public.\n\n\"I was lucky to be able to get out of that situation, but many women still don't have their most basic human rights, such as education. It's really sad and heartbreaking,\" says Roya.\n\nBut years before the Taliban returned to power, Roya decided she \"didn't want that life\".\n\nHer decision to flee Afghanistan in 2011, leaving her then husband behind, carried many risks for a woman in traditional Afghan society. It is not a time she likes to remember - and does not want to talk about it.\n\nIn Norway, Roya faced a completely different environment. She had to adapt to a new, more liberal culture, find a job to support herself and her family and learn Norwegian.\n\nIt was difficult to juggle all the demands in the early days, but her efforts eventually paid off.\n\nRoya studied nursing and worked at a hospital in the capital, Oslo.\n\nRoya's introduction to bodybuilding was the next turning point in her life. Attending gyms wasn't just about physical exercise; it was also a way to rebuild her self-confidence and redefine her personal identity.\n\nIt was also where she met her second husband, fellow Afghan Kamal Jalaluddin.\n\nHe had a long history in bodybuilding and is one of Roya's main supporters.\n\n\"Before I met Kamal, I was doing sports, but not at a professional level,\" she explained.\n\n\"His support gave me the courage to choose a competitive and taboo-breaking path. I believe that if a man stands by a woman, amazing things can happen.\"\n\nEighteen months ago, Roya decided to leave her nursing career and enter the world of bodybuilding professionally.\n\nIt was a risky decision, although the main challenge for her was not changing jobs. Instead, she said it was more about adapting to freedoms after the restraints she had experienced in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Our biggest challenge was to break through the boundaries and frameworks that others had set for us - the unwritten rules that were imposed on us in the name of tradition, culture, religion or whatever,\" she said. \"But when you decide to innovate, you have to free yourself from those frameworks.\"\n\nIt has also not come without its problems.\n\nThe bikinis, flowing hair and heavy make-up she wears on stage are a million miles away from the social norms - and now official restrictions - which dictate how women dress and present themselves in her home country.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising then that her social media accounts have been bombarded with criticism, often including threats of violence and even death.\n\nShe dismisses the comments.\n\n\"People only see my appearance and my bikini. But behind this appearance, there are years of suffering, effort and perseverance. These successes have not come easily.\"\n\nBut social media is far from a negative for Roya: it allows her to speak to women back in Afghanistan, talking to them about the importance of physical health, self-confidence and rebuilding one's identity.\n\nNow Roya is preparing to compete in the world bodybuilding championships - which start on Thursday in Barcelona - where she is hoping to build on successes she had earlier this year.\n\nShe won gold in the Wellness category at the Stoperiet Open bodybuilding competition in April - a category which places special emphasis on natural fitness, healthy appearance and unobtrusive beauty, rather than large muscle mass.\n\nHer victory was quickly followed by another at the prestigious Norway Classic 2025, which attracts athletes from all over Scandinavia.\n\nFrom there, it was onto the European championships - which clinched her a spot in the world championships.\n\n\"I feel a deep sense of happiness, pride and honour within me,\" she said as she prepared to compete in the Spanish city. \"It's been an incredibly tough journey throughout the year, but step by step, I managed to achieve gold medals along the way.\"\n\nFrom the sidelines, her husband and son are always cheering her on.\n\n\"Seeing Roya on stage was the fulfilment of a dream we built together,\" enthuses Kamal.\n\nBut for Roya, this contest in particular is for more than just her and her family.\n\n\"I feel mentally strong and fully ready to give my all, hoping to make history by setting this record in the name of Afghan girls and women for the very first time.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pvlvdve7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"23:12:23.111+00:00","title":"Two meals for $1: Why China's youth are not spending","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China's youth are increasingly adopting frugal lifestyles due to high unemployment, job insecurity, and economic uncertainty, leading to widespread caution in spending.

consumers to start spending more for the good of all, but it is not having much luck convincing them to do so.\n\nOfficials say insufficient domestic consumption across much of society is dragging on growth, but recent graduates have more reasons than most to be cautious.\n\nYouth unemployment has been hovering at just under 20% for some time, those who have jobs fear they could lose them, and the ongoing property crisis can make the prospect of home ownership seem unreachable, especially in big cities.\n\nThis uncertainty is encouraging many of China's youth to instead embrace frugality, and social media has been flooded with tips on how people can survive on small amounts of money.\n\n\"My work is dedicated to a minimalist way of life,\" one full-time influencer tells the BBC.\n\nVideos by the 24-year-old, who goes by the online name Zhang Small Grain of Rice, feature content like her using a bar of ordinary soap for all her personal cleaning requirements, rather than expensive skin cleansing products.\n\nShe can also be seen walking around shopping areas and showing off various bags and items of clothing which she says are good value because they'll last longer.\n\nCompanies pay her to feature their goods to her 97,000 followers on the Xiaohongshu site.\n\n\"I hope more people will understand consumption traps so they can save. This will reduce their stress and relax them,\" she said.\n\nOthers focus on budget eating.\n\nA 29-year-old using the name Little Grass Floating In Beijing posts videos of himself preparing basic dishes. He says he can have two meals for a little over $1 (76p).\n\n\"I am just an ordinary person from the countryside. I have neither a good educational background nor a network of influential contacts, so I must work hard for a better life\", he tells his followers.\n\nHe works for an online sales firm and claims his extremely modest lifestyle has enabled him to save more than $180,000 over 6 years.\n\nSome have asked him online if he would expect his future wife and children to live the same way and what the end goal is. His response: \"I don't know\".\n\nChina has developed a reputation for being an unstoppable economy, able to ride out the turmoil of the pandemic and US President Donald Trump's trade war.\n\nBut analysts say it will face significant long-term challenges if it does not boost domestic spending.\n\nWhile the US has a problem with people racking up credit card debt, in China it's the opposite challenge. People are already inclined to save rather than spend and this only increases when there are perceptions of tough times ahead.\n\nThe Chinese government has been promising for years to increase household consumption but it still accounts for only around 39% of gross domestic product (GDP), as opposed to about 60% in most developed countries.\n\nPart of the problem is that today's youth are more pessimistic than in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n\"Right now, making money is more important to me. I actually need to expand my income sources and cut my costs,\" a young woman in central Beijing tells the BBC.\n\nLike many other young people, her salary has been cut, she adds.\n\n\"I changed jobs, and it doesn't pay as well. Also, I don't know for how long this new job can sustain me in the future. A bad economic environment like this makes people feel down because we're not earning very much. Finding a job in the first place also isn't easy.\"\n\nThis level of youth unemployment - apart from spreading insecurity - makes it easier for struggling employers to cut wages because workers face a choice of accepting lower pay or diving into a highly competitive job market.\n\nA young man, also in his 20s, says there are low-level jobs available but it's hard to find decent work in one's area of expertise.\n\n\"Some of my friends are unemployed, still living at home and looking for a job,\" he says.\n\n\"They had all kinds of majors at university from financial services to product sales. The economy is a bit off right now. I hope it gets better so we can all have a better life\".\n\nAnd how does he rate the chances of this happening soon? \"I'm not very optimistic,\" he admits.\n\nA big concern for China's recent graduates is that the country is making a difficult transition from being a mass producer of cheap goods to a high-tech economy.  And many of these new industries don't require as many workers.\n\nEconomist George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University,  has been tracking this phenomenon.\n\nHe cites figures from two big recruitment firms in Beijing showing a high level of university graduates, even with master's degrees, taking jobs as delivery drivers.\n\n\"It reflects the skills mismatch between the qualifications which people are leaving higher education with and what's out there in terms of demand for labour,\" he says.\n\n\"Of course, that's not being helped by the push to become a champion in robotics and AI because, at least for the time being, this is something of a dampener on job opportunities. Tech isn't really that labour intensive.\"\n\nHelena Lofgren has been studying China's consumption patterns for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and believes its economy is relying too heavily on pouring money into preferred industries and focusing on selling products overseas in a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty.\n\n\"People save more than they consume, and you need consumption to make up a bigger share of the economy than it's doing today in China,\" she says.\n\n\"You have a very export-oriented and investment driven economy and what we see now is that these parts are too big for the economy to stay healthy.\"\n\nIt is all about economic imbalance. If, for example, China suddenly lost significant export revenue would it have the tools to counter this by financially empowering its enormous domestic population?\n\nSome observers have questioned how serious the Communist Party is about increasing domestic consumption.\n\nIn recent decades, the country has thrived on an investment and export model but that approach is now facing a big challenge: deflation. Would-be customers are often waiting for the price of goods to fall.\n\nIf a young couple wanted to buy, say, a new lounge suite, it may make sense for them to wait to get a better deal.\n\nThe longer they, and many more like them, hold off from making big purchases, the more likely companies are to cut prices, leading people to wait even longer for an even better deal.\n\nIt may seem like a good idea to have cheaper goods, but deflation can force firms out of business and drag on growth overall.\n\nThis could be countered by somehow fuelling optimism amongst 20 or 30-something consumers. Building a better social safety net or increasing minimum wages might help.\n\nThere have been some attempts to do this by offering incentives to replace old cars, home appliances and other items but it has not significantly lifted consumption.\n\nThe influencer Zhang says being cautious with spending runs deep in her country's culture.\n\n\"My grandfather's generation was very frugal, very thrifty. It is part of Chinese tradition. For Chinese people to be economical is in their bones,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20xx2pl69o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:02:44.288+00:00","title":"She Zhijiang: Thailand extradites owner of Myanmar scam city to China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"She Zhijiang, a Chinese national born in Hunan province in 1982, has been extradited from Thailand to China after years of detention, following accusations of running illegal online gambling rings and scam operations in Southeast Asia.

request to Interpol.\n\nChina accuses She Zhijiang of running illegal online gambling rings, and this week a Thai court upheld the decision to extradite him.  He arrived at a Bangkok airport on Wednesday, flanked by two security officials.\n\nHis extradition comes ahead of a landmark visit by Thailand's king to Beijing - the first state visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch and a sign of deepening ties.\n\nShe Zhijiang is one of the biggest names linked to the vast cyberscam hubs in South East Asia, which have trapped thousands of Chinese nationals and sparked a crackdown from Beijing.\n\nOne of his most notorious projects is Myanmar's Shwe Kokko city, near the Thai border.\n\nIt's portrayed in promotional videos as a resort city for Chinese tourists, but its glitzy buildings are allegedly home to fraud, money laundering and human trafficking.\n\nDuring a  visit to the city earlier this year , the BBC saw very few overseas visitors.

The RSF, which seized control of the city after an 18-month siege, has been accused of killing at least 460 patients and their companions, abducting six health workers — including four doctors, a nurse, and a pharmacist — and executing those who remained.

The RSF denies these allegations, releasing videos claiming hospitals are open and staff are free, but medical and humanitarian experts dismiss these as propaganda.

before fleeing alleged massacre\n\nA man who escaped the last functioning hospital in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher before a reported massacre by paramilitary troops says he has lost all hope and happiness.\n\n\"I have lost my colleagues,\" Abdu-Rabbu Ahmed, a laboratory technician at the Saudi Maternity Hospital, told the BBC.\n\n\"I have lost the people whose faces I used to see smiling... It feels as if you lost a big part of your body or your soul.\"\n\nHe was speaking to us from a displaced persons camp in Tawila some 70km (43 miles) to the west of el-Fasher, the regional hub which was taken over by paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the last week of October after an 18-month siege.\n\nThe RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into a civil war.\n\nThe alleged killings of at least 460 patients and their companions at the Saudi Hospital  were one of the most shocking among widespread accounts of atrocities  - some of them filmed by RSF fighters and posted to social media.\n\nIn a statement of condemnation, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was \"appalled and deeply shocked\" by the reported shootings, and by the abductions of six health workers - four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist.\n\nThe RSF has dismissed the accusations as disinformation, declaring that all of el-Fasher's hospitals had been abandoned. It disputed the claims by filming a video inside the hospital grounds showing female volunteers tending to patients.\n\nA freelancer based in Tawila gathered interviews for the BBC.\n\nMr Ahmed told him he had carried on working at Saudi Hospital since the beginning of the war, despite regular shelling by artillery, tanks and drones - which destroyed parts of the buildings and injured doctors and nurses as well as patients.\n\nMedical staff used to share what little food was available as the RSF blockade tightened, he said, sometimes working without breakfast or lunch.\n\nMost of them fled when the paramilitary fighters launched their final assault.\n\n\"The shelling started around six in the morning,\" Mr Ahmed said.\n\n\"All civilians and soldiers headed out towards the southern side. There was a state of terror, and as we walked, drones were bombing us. And heavy artillery too - I saw many people die on the spot, there was no-one who could save them.\"\n\nMr Ahmed said some of the fleeing medical workers arrived with him in Tawila, but many were detained in locations north-west of the city, naming the Garni area, the villages of Turra and Hilla al-Sheikh and the town of Korma.\n\nSome were transferred to Nyala, he said, the RSF's de facto capital in South Darfur.\n\n\"This is the information I received from colleagues we know,\" he told the BBC, saying that he later heard medical staff who remained at the hospital were executed.\n\nMr Ahmed also lost much of his family: a sister and two brothers were killed that day, and his parents are missing.\n\n\"I am very worried about the fate of the people inside el-Fasher,\" he added.\n\n\"They may be killed. And they may be used as human shields against the [Sudanese air force] airstrikes.\"\n\nAccounts of the alleged hospital massacre were reported by two Sudanese doctors' groups, citing sources on the ground, and an el-Fasher activist network.\n\nYale University's Humanitarian Research Lab said satellite imagery corroborated the reports, apparently showing blood on the ground and white grouped objects that looked like bodies in the hospital compound.\n\nIn a satellite image from 1 November, the white objects are seen being placed at an area that had been dug within the compound of the hospital. In a subsequent one, taken on 6 November, these objects are seen charred and with smoke still rising from the area.\n\nBBC Verify has authenticated footage filmed at the nearby University of El-Fasher's Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences: it shows bodies lying on the floor and an RSF fighter shooting one of the men still alive.\n\nA spokesman for the Sudan Doctors Network, Dr Mohamed Elsheikh, told the BBC this building was being used as an extension to the Saudi hospital for wards and patients.\n\nHe went on to explain that the RSF had been demanding ransoms for the release of the abducted health workers.\n\n\"The six kidnapped doctors or medical staff, one of them, his family, managed to pay the ransom equivalent to $30,000 [£23,000], and he arrived safely to Tawila town,\" said Dr Elsheikh, now working for the NHS in the UK.\n\n\"The other was executed,\" he added, saying the group has no information on the fate of the remaining four.\n\nBack in Tawila, Mohamed Abdu-Teia, who had been a patient at the Saudi Hospital when the RSF closed in, can do little else but lay on the ground with his leg in a tattered cast.\n\nIt was broken in a shelling attack, he tells the BBC, but he managed to flee the city on foot the morning of the final RSF assault.\n\nLike many other men suspected of being soldiers, Mr Abdu-Teia was stopped at the Garni checkpoint and interrogated, he says. The two men with him were taken, but the RSF let him go.\n\n\"They didn't beat me, but they questioned me a lot, because of my injury, I think. They said: 'We know you are a soldier, but you're finished - you will die on the road. So just go.\"\n\nMr Abdu-Teia says the RSF brought some medicine to Garni but \"the injuries were too many - two or three people died every hour.\n\n\"The same day we arrived, vehicles came and took people to unknown places. Any young man who looked physically OK was taken.\"\n\nHe managed to get a lift to Tawila from \"people who had cars\". They charged passengers 500,000 Sudanese pounds ($830, £630) and turned on wi-fi hotspots so they could call their families to transfer money, he said. \"We left with them - we had nothing, not even plans.\"\n\nMany children arrived at the Tawila camps without parents. Fifteen-year-old Eman was one of them.\n\nHer father was killed in a drone strike in el-Fasher, she told the BBC, and her mother and brother were detained by the RSF as they fled.\n\n\"Whoever did not die, [the RSF] ran them over with vehicles,\" she said. \"They took our belongings and told us all of you are soldiers. They beat my brother and choked him with a chain.\n\n\"They wanted to beat my mother. She told us: 'Go, I will come to you.' We got into a vehicle and left. They did not allow my brother to get into the vehicle. We left them behind.\"\n\nEman escaped but saw other girls and women who did not.\n\n\"They took some women. They took them in their vehicles and stabbed some of them with knives. Some were taken while their mothers couldn't do anything.\"\n\nFemale survivors have told horrific stories of gang rapes and the abduction of young girls.\n\nAnother teenager on her own, 14-year-old Samar, said she had lost her mother in the chaos at the Garni checkpoint, and her father was arrested.\n\nShe was told he was taken to the Children's Hospital in el-Fasher.\n\nThat building had reportedly been serving as an RSF detention centre, and it is where the Yale researchers also said satellite images showed evidence of killings: apparent clusters of bodies as well as earth excavations that could have been a mass grave.\n\nThe RSF has issued videos to counter these allegations, declaring that the Children's Hospital in el-Fasher is ready to receive patients.\n\nOne shows a man dressed in a blazer standing outside its gate with a group of what appear to be doctors in hospital scrubs.\n\n\"These medical personnel and cadres, they are not hostages,\" the man in the blazer says. \"We are not taking them as war hostages. They are free. They are free to practise medicine.\"\n\nAnother man in the video, who introduces himself as Dr Ishaq Abdul Mahmoud, associate professor of paediatrics and child health at el-Fasher University, says: \"We are here to help any person in need of medical service.\n\n\"We are out of politics. Whether soldiers or [civilians] we are ready to help them.\"\n\nDr Elsheikh of the Sudan Doctors Network dismisses the RSF videos as propaganda.\n\nAnd Mr Ahmed, the Saudi Hospital laboratory technician in Tawila, knows what he has seen, and he has seen too much.\n\n\"I do not have any hope of returning to el-Fasher,\" he says.\n\n\"After everything that happened and everything I saw. Even if there was a small hope, I remember what happened in front of me.\"\n\nMohamed Zakaria is a freelance journalist from Darfur based in Kampala\n\nAdditional reporting by BBC Verify's Peter Mwai\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ng8w1xrjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:37:29.926+00:00","title":"Katseye: Girl group have received 'thousands' of death threats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Global girl group Katseye, formed through a collaboration between Korean entertainment giant Hybe and American label Geffen Records, has faced thousands of online death threats and racist, sexist, and non-consensual fan behavior since their debut.

Girl group have received 'thousands' of death threats\n\nGlobal girl group Katseye say they have received multiple online death threats since they made their debut last year.\n\nThe six-piece, who were recently nominated for best new artist at the Grammy Awards, told BBC News that the messages, which have also targeted their families, \"can get really heavy\".\n\n\"I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, but if 1,000 people are sending you death threats, it's jarring,\" said singer Lara Raj. \"Even if it's not going to happen, it's heavy.\"\n\nRaj, who is a US citizen with Tamil Indian heritage, has also been subjected to racist comments, and was falsely reported to ICE for \"working and residing in the United States without legal authorisation\".\n\nThe 20-year-old said she had \"deleted Twitter\" (now known as X), to avoid seeing negative comments.\n\n\"I realised I am not the audience for other people's opinions,\" she said.\n\nKatseye did not specify the nature of the threats they have received; but aggressive and inappropriate behaviour is  depressingly common amongst fan communities .\n\nLast year,  Chappell Roan criticised  the \"many nonconsensual physical and social interactions\" she had had with fans, including people harassing her family and friends.\n\nPop band Muna chastised some of their supporters for \"spreading falsehoods about us and our loved ones for clout and attention\"; while Doja Cat called out \"creepy\" behaviour from a section of her fanbase.\n\n\"Our career has been really short, but I feel like we've gotten a lot of things already said to us, to our families,\" said Katseye singer Sophia Laforteza.\n\n\"We know that we signed up for being so public. We know it's a part of fame. But it doesn't change the fact that we are human.\"\n\nRaj also pointed out the sexist nature of the comments the band have received.\n\n\"People see us as women to rank. They'll grade us based on how pretty we are, our singing skill, dancing skill, and then add it up and give us a percentage.\n\n\"That's so dystopian.\"\n\n\"I feel like it's very terrorising on the mind,\" added her bandmate Manon Bannerman.\n\nDespite the online negativity, Katseye are having a remarkable year.\n\nTheir second EP, Beautiful Chaos, peaked at number two in the US album charts, thanks to the gratingly brilliant lead single, Gnarly, and the Charli XCX-penned follow-up, Gabriella.\n\nAn advert they filmed for the clothing brand Gap went viral in August, racking up 400 million plays and 8 billion social media \"impressions\" (\"Isn't there only 7 billion people in the world?\" asked singer Megan Skiendiel when presented with the statistic).\n\nLast month, they won best performance at the MTV Awards. Five days ago, they became only the third girl group in history to receive a best new artist nomination at the Grammys, following SWV and Wilson Phillips.\n\nThe six members, who range in age between 17 and 22, are truly international.\n\nDaniela Avanzini is a Venezuelan-Cuban American from Atlanta. Raj is an Indian-Sri Lankan American from New York. Bannerman is a Ghanaian-Italian from Zurich. Megan Skiendiel is a Chinese-Singaporean American from Honolulu. Laforteza is from Manila in the Philippines. And Yoonchae Jeung was born and raised in South Korea.\n\nThey were hand-picked to form Katseye on The Debut: Dream Academy, a reality show created by Korean entertainment giant Hybe – the label behind BTS and Le Sserafim - and America's Geffen Records, home to Olivia Rodrigo and Guns N' Roses.\n\nThousands applied, but only 20 made it through to the training and development stage – a gruelling, two-year bootcamp of daily dance lessons, vocal practice and brutal feedback.\n\nRehearsing one dance routine, they were scolded for their lack of synchronisation: \"It's got to sound like one person walking down the stairs. It can't sound like a group of people falling down the stairs.\"\n\nThose days are long behind them. The sextet learned the intricate, aerobic choreography for their Gap advert in just one day.\n\n\"The longer we're together as a group, the shorter it takes,\" said Skiendiel.\n\n\"One day of rehearsals and we're really in sync. Then we nitpick the rest.\"\n\nLast year's SIS (Soft Is Strong) EP established the band with a confident, slick pop sound. But it was Gnarly that really put them on the map.\n\nReleased in April, the song is two minutes and seventeen seconds of aggressively chaotic beat drops, juddering synths and gang vocals.\n\nIt instantly divided opinion: \"Genuinely atrocious\" was one of the kinder comments. “But people kept coming back for more.

2025-11-11T23:11:06.664+00:00\n\nTitle: China and Japan in escalating spat over Taiwan: What to know\n\nOver the past week, China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words.\n\nIt all started when Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that if China attacked Taiwan then Japan could respond with its own self-defence force.\n\nSince then, foreign ministries on both sides have lodged serious protests with the other, and a Chinese diplomat made what some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi.\n\nThe spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of Taiwan.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\n\n\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.\n\nA \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.\n\nTakaichi's remarks drew ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".\n\nOn Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".\n\nWhile the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.\n\nTokyo has lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing has lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.\n\nXue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful commenting on specific scenarios from now on.\n\nThere is a longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.\n\nHistorical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, Shinzo Abe's protege, suggests more tensions may lay ahead.\n\nThe conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.\n\nTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan.\n\nShe had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.\n\nChina is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.\n\nOn the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nIn 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".\n\nIn this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\n\n\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\n\n\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx276px3280o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:49:11.762+00:00","title":"Pokrovsk: Russian forces use fog cover to push further into key Ukraine town","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thick fog in eastern Ukraine has enabled Russian forces to intensify their military advance into the strategic city of Pokrovsk, where they now reportedly have 300 to 500 troops, with southern areas under occupation.

Ukraine's military says there may now be 300-500 Russians there and President Voloydymyr Zelensky says the situation remains difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi says the situation on the front line in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region has \"significantly worsened\", with the loss of three settlements.\n\nSyrskyi said however that Russia was most active around Pokrovsk. A video has gone viral on social media showing Russian soldiers openly driving through a hazy road on civilian cars and motorbikes.\n\nThe BBC has verified the location where the video was filmed as the southern outskirts of the town on the Selidove-Pokrovsk highway.\n\nFor several days fog obscured visibility to carry out aerial reconnaissance, says a drone pilot from the \"Shershni Dovbusha\" unit of the 68th brigade with the call-sign \"Goose\".\n\nThat's why, he told the BBC, the Russians had even \"dared\" to launch assaults using a column of vehicles, which would normally have been wiped out immediately by Ukrainian drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC his unit had regularly detected and eliminated small Russian groups trying to advance on foot and on motor bikes.  He added they were also involved in repelling the attack featured in the viral video, said to have been filmed on Sunday.\n\nThe convoy was partly destroyed, \"Goose\" claims, however weather conditions meant there was no video monitoring of the moment they repelled the attack so he was not sure if the entire group was hit.\n\nA week ago, Zelensky estimated that up to 300 Russian soldiers were fighting in Pokrovsk. The video suggests those numbers have probably increased in that time and the military confirmed that on Wednesday, with southern areas of the city now under Russian occupation.\n\nRussian troops appear to be closing in on most areas of Pokrovsk, according to mapping by the Ukraine-based DeepState monitoring group. Some observers say that its fall is imminent.\n\nMost parts of the city are now in a grey zone that neither side fully controls, says \"Goose\". \"We might hold positions in one building, but the enemy can be in the next one. They're trying to get behind our backs,\" he says.\n\nMoscow is trying to encircle Pokrovsk and neighbouring Myrnohrad in what is known as a \"cauldron\".\n\nEven if the \"lid\" is not closed, Russians can constantly target all routes in and out of it using FPV drones.\n\nTo prevent such an encirclement, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian troops back from Suvorove and Rodynske on the eastern part of the \"cauldron\", creating a bigger gap between Russian flanks.\n\nRussian forces are trying to cut off logistical routes supporting Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk.\n\nThey attack supply routes, not only remotely using drones and artillery but also by sending in soldiers on the ground, the Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC.\n\nThis tactic is called infiltration and it has proved quite successful, says Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets.\n\nHe argues that Russian forces have specifically targeted Ukrainian FPV pilots so they do not have sufficient resources to detect the movement of smaller Russian groups.\n\nIn an urban environment, Russian soldiers sometimes infiltrate by dressing up as locals or as Ukrainian military, says Mashovets.  Their main goal is to cause chaos among Ukrainian defenders, which is then followed by a push from the main forces of the Russian army, he adds.\n\nThe Kremlin is also trying to push in other parts of the front line – in Kupyansk in the north-east and in Zapporizhzhya region in the south.\n\nViktor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Joint Forces Operation, denied Moscow's claim that they had managed to surround Kupyansk but admitted that Russian troops were present in the south of the town and the situation was difficult."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxylxw48yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:25:31.953+00:00","title":"Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in Gaza since ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since the ceasefire with Hamas began on 10 October 2023, satellite imagery reviewed by BBC Verify indicates that Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in areas of Gaza under its control, including neighborhoods such as Abasan al-Kabira and al-Bayuk.

areas of Gaza that have remained under its control since the ceasefire with Hamas started on 10 October, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show.\n\nThe new photos - the latest of which was taken on 8 November - show that entire neighbourhoods controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been levelled in less than a month, apparently through demolitions.\n\nThe actual number of destroyed buildings could be significantly higher, with satellite imagery for some areas being unavailable for BBC Verify's assessment.\n\nSome experts have argued that the demolitions may violate the terms of the ceasefire brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. But an IDF spokesperson told BBC Verify that it was acting \"in accordance with the ceasefire framework\".\n\nUS President Donald Trump's 20 point peace plan for Gaza - the basis for the ceasefire - stated \"all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended\". He has since repeatedly  stated that \"the war is over\" .\n\nBBC Verify's visual analysis of satellite imagery has found that the destruction of buildings in Gaza by the Israeli military has been continuing on a huge scale. We used a change detection algorithm to analyse radar images taken before and after the ceasefire to highlight changes, which might indicate destruction, then manually counted visibly destroyed buildings.\n\nWe looked at buildings destroyed behind the Yellow Line - a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. Under October's ceasefire deal Israel agreed to withdraw its forces to that marker, annotated by a yellow line on maps released by the IDF.\n\nMany of the razed buildings did not appear to be damaged prior to being destroyed, for example, in eastern Khan Younis, around Abasan al-Kabira.\n\nIt's hard to be conclusive from a satellite image taken from above, but these buildings did not have visible damage to their structure or tell tale signs like nearby rubble or changes to their outlines. There were houses with gardens, trees and some small orchards.\n\nA comparison between satellite images of this area captured at the start of the war in October 2023 with images captured around the date of the ceasefire shows little change to many buildings.\n\nLana Khalil used to live in Abasan al-Kabira before she was displaced to nearby al-Mawasi. She described her home as being a \"heaven\" and full of \"farms and vegetables\".\n\nNow, like so many other parts of Gaza, the area has been reduced to rubble.\n\n\"The Israeli military left nothing to us, they demolished everything,\" she said. Ms Khalil added that former residents could hear the demolition of the area \"from our tents in al-Mawasi\".\n\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" she said.\n\nIn another area, near al-Bayuk, east of the city of Rafah, satellite imagery tells the same story. Numerous buildings that seemed from above to be undamaged before the ceasefire have since been destroyed. Aerial footage of a huge explosion published at the start of November shows dust rising from the ruins of the neighbourhood.\n\nDestruction has also continued in Gaza City itself, in the eastern neighbourhood of Shejaiya as well as near the Indonesian hospital on the edge of Jabalia camp.\n\nEitan Shamir, ex-head of the National Security Doctrine Department in the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs, suggested that the IDF's actions were not a violation of the ceasefire terms, arguing that they don't apply to areas of the Strip behind the Yellow Line.\n\nVerified videos showing controlled demolitions and excavators tearing down buildings published to social media since the ceasefire have also been geolocated to areas behind the Yellow Line.\n\nThe IDF has defended its actions and a spokesperson said: \"According to the agreement, all terror infrastructure, including tunnels, is to be dismantled throughout Gaza. Israel is acting in response to threats, violations, and terror infrastructure.\"\n\nOn 18 October, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that \"demilitarizing Gaza by destroying the terror tunnels and all terror infrastructure\" was a \"clear\" part of Israel's security policy.\n\nPoint 13 of Trump's peace plan published by the White House - the closest thing to publicly released terms of the ceasefire - stated that all \"military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt\".\n\nBut it also states the process of demilitarisation of Gaza will be \"under the supervision of independent monitors\".\n\n\"This is definitely a violation of the ceasefire,\" said Dr H A Hellyer, a RUSI Senior Associate Fellow. \"But [Washington] DC is unwilling to recognise it as such, insisting that the ceasefire has to hold, even when it isn't actually holding.\"\n\nBut Mr Shamir denied the IDF was breaching the ceasefire. He told BBC Verify that according to his sources within the IDF there was a view that: \"Hamas is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls, and Israel is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls.\"\n\nThe IDF was taking the view that it was unlikely Hamas would follow through with the second stage of the agreement, according to his sources.\n\n\"Therefore, the space must be prepared for the continuation of the fighting, so as not to leave [them] any options to ambush our soldiers.\" He also said that there were frequent attempts by Hamas to infiltrate beyond the Yellow Line and that there were still long sections of tunnel to be dealt with.\n\nSome analysts - such as Adil Haque, professor of law at Rutgers University - said Israel could be violating the laws of war, which prohibit the destruction of civilian property by an occupying power.\n\nHe noted that exceptions to the rule can only arise \"from military operations, that is, from combat or direct preparations for combat,\" arguing that during a ceasefire \"it is not plausible that such significant destruction of civilian property has been rendered absolutely necessary by military operations\".\n\nHugh Lovatt, Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said ultimately the demolitions could jeopardise the peace plan.\n\n\"The problem of Israeli demolitions will grow the longer Israel stays in the zone behind the Yellow Line.\n\n\"Ultimately, the sense that Israel is stalling its withdrawal and looking to create new permanent facts on the ground, as it has in the West Bank, will become an increasingly greater threat to the maintenance of the ceasefire.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Murray\n\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c709y1yx1r0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:26:57.597+00:00","title":"Trump v the BBC: What are the hurdles for his legal argument?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has threatened a $1 billion defamation lawsuit against the BBC over alleged edits of his January 2021 speech in the Panorama documentary, which he claims misrepresented him as inciting the Capitol riot.

damages up to $1bn (£759m), claiming the organisation made \"false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\" about him in a documentary.\n\nIn a letter to the BBC, Trump's legal team demanded three things - to issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".\n\nA leaked memo, written by a former independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial standards committee, suggested the Panorama programme had edited parts of a Trump speech together so he appeared to explicitly encourage the Capitol Hill riot of January 2021.\n\nThe one-hour programme was broadcast in the UK just before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSo how strong is Trump's case?\n\nThe BBC chairman, Samir Shah, said he would like to apologise for the documentary, saying the news outlet had made \"an error of judgement\" because the edits gave the impression of a \"direct call to action\" by Trump.\n\nThe outgoing director general of the BBC, Tim Davie, who resigned amid the criticism, said: \"I think we did make a mistake, and there was an editorial breach.\"\n\nBut experts on US media and defamation law say the president faces significant obstacles to winning such enormous damages from a lawsuit against the BBC, partly due to strong US press freedom laws.\n\nTrump has signalled an intention to bring any eventual litigation in the US state of Florida, rather than in the UK.\n\nThe controversy began last week, after the Telegraph published the leaked memo that criticised the documentary and the way it edited Trump's speech.\n\nTrump actually said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nHowever, in the Panorama edit, he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nHis address on the Ellipse was delivered as Congress was set to certify the 2020 election results for the winner, Joe Biden. Minutes after he concluded his speech, a large crowd of his supporters breached the US Capitol.\n\nDays later, the US House of Representatives voted to impeach the president on a count of \"incitement of insurrection\" and the Senate later acquitted him. Trump has said his speech was \"perfect\".\n\nThe White House responded to the Telegraph story, its press secretary calling the BBC \"total, 100% fake news\".\n\nAfter Davie and the CEO of the BBC's news division quit, the threat of legal action followed. Trump's lawyer said in his letter to the BBC that in the documentary, the corporation had \"intentionally sought to completely mislead its viewers\" by splicing together three separate clips of the speech.\n\nIt added that the BBC had caused the president \"overwhelming financial and reputational harm\".\n\nTrump, in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News, later said he had an \"obligation\" to sue and described the documentary edits as \"very dishonest\".\n\nThe US Constitution's First Amendment gives significant protection to freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n\nThe landmark 1964 US Supreme Court decision New York Times v Sullivan established that public figures suing for defamation must prove \"actual malice\" meaning \"the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false\".\n\nTrump would need to prove three major components - that the content published was factually false in a way that was defamatory; that he suffered harm due to the false and defamatory coverage; and that the media organisation knew it was false and acted with \"actual malice\".\n\n\"All of them create some difficulties for a plaintiff, I would think,\" George Freeman, the Executive Director of the Media Law Resource Center in New York told BBC Radio 4.\n\nBut not everyone agreed.\n\nBurt Neuborne, a professor emeritus at New York University School of Law, said Trump had a case against the BBC because the edits of Trump's remarks were misleading. He said the error did not amount to \"innocent splicing\".\n\n\"The actual malice here is the knowing dissemination of something that was purported to be verbatim, but which is not,\" said Mr Neuborne, the former national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Whether a jury would actually award Trump significant damages for such a mistake is less likely, he added.\n\nThe statute of limitations - or a deadline to file a lawsuit - on defamation in the UK is one year, which has already elapsed for Trump because the documentary aired in October 2024.\n\nFlorida, on the other hand - where Trump has signalled an intention to bring any eventual litigation - has a two-year limit.\n\nWhile Florida law gives him more time, bringing a defamation case in the United States will mean Trump faces a tougher legal standard.\n\nIf Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there. There is no evidence so far to suggest that it has been shown in the US.\n\nThe BBC's best chance to dismiss any future legal case would be to argue that the state is not the appropriate jurisdiction because there wasn't a \"sufficient exposure of the information in Florida\", Mr Neuborne said.\n\nTrump's letter to the BBC concludes that if the BBC does not comply with their demands by 14 November, \"President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"\n\nBut to be awarded a billion dollars in a defamation lawsuit in Florida, a plaintiff like the president would have to prove he actually suffered that much in losses, said Professor Lyrissa Lidskey of the University of Florida Levin College of Law.\n\n\"Given that he won the presidency after this and has continued to make money in his businesses, it seems implausible that he's going to be able to prove a billion dollars worth of damages,\" she said.\n\nTrump has sued several US news organisations for large sums of money, and in a few instances secured large settlements.\n\nIn 2025, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, agreed to pay Trump $16m, after he sued over a 60 Minutes interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Trump claimed the video was edited to better portray Harris - whom he was running against at the time.\n\nABC News also paid Trump $15m after one of its anchors, George Stephanopoulos, falsely claimed in an interview that Trump had been found liable for rape. The president was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation of writer E Jean Carroll in 2023.\n\nHe filed a suit against the New York Times for $15bn over critical comments reporters made against him during his 2024 presidential campaign. A federal judge dismissed the case in September because it was submitted with an \"improper and impermissible\" form, but allowed Trump to refile a shorter complaint.\n\nTrump's many lawsuits against media organisations have cost him little, while they can prove expensive for news outlets, said Seth Stern, the advocacy director for the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\n\"He doesn't care if he wins or not. The point is to intimidate and punish those he views as critical to him,\" Mr Stern said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e352emrro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:09:42.949+00:00","title":"Happy birthday to the PlayStation 5 - but why no plans for a PS6?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores why Sony has delayed the release of a PlayStation 6, with the PS5 now celebrating its fifth anniversary.

Five years later, the PS2 was released and brought with it significant changes.\n\nIt was a similar story for other consoles but, of late, things seem to have slowed down - which might explain why, as the PS5 hits its fifth anniversary, a potential PS6 is nowhere in sight.\n\nAccording to PlayStation's business boss, Eric Lempel, that's because there's plenty of life in the old dog yet.\n\n\"I would say we're really hitting our stride now,\" he told BBC News.\n\nGiven there remains \"a lot of great content\"  the company is \"just going to continue with PS5\" he explained.\n\nMr Lempel oversaw the launch of the console, which was plagued by supply chain issues upon its release as a result of a global chip shortage.\n\nThe supply problems were resolved after three years, and the console has gone on to sell more than 84 million units worldwide.\n\nAnd, as it turns five, he said the title which would become the PS5's biggest seller hadn't even been released yet.\n\n\"I'm not gonna tell you which one, but I think it's still to come,\" he said.\n\nThere are plenty of high-profile games in the works.\n\nMarvel's Wolverine, made by the same team behind the successful Spider-Man series, is set for a 2026 release - while Intergalactic, the upcoming game from Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog, is in development.\n\nIndustry expert Christopher Dring said Naughty Dog's schedule went some way to explain why consoles were lasting longer - because it takes more time to make games for them than it used to.\n\n\"During the PS3 generation, Naughty Dog released four games,\" he said.\n\n\"During the PS4 generation, that dropped to three games - so far during the PS5 generation, it's not released one.\n\n\"Games are taking so much longer to make that, in some cases, their development schedules are longer than it takes new hardware to come out.\"\n\nAnd he said this story was repeated \"across the industry\", with Grand Theft Auto 6 - which will be on both PlayStation and Xbox -  recently delayed to November 2026 .\n\nBut if the big hitters are coming more slowly, Mr Dring said, another factor might also explain the longevity of a console like the PS5 - gamers are more willing to try new things.\n\n\"We're seeing on average people are playing 50% more games than they did last generation, and they're really branching out to different types of games,\" he said.\n\n\"They'll play the hits, but they'll also play smaller games or unique games that they've never heard of before.\"\n\nOne of the reasons the firm may not rush to unveil new hardware is the PS5 remains ahead of its rivals, outselling Microsoft's Series X and S consoles - at least in the home console space.\n\nThe same can't be said when it comes to handhelds though.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch - a handheld console which connects to a TV to play games on a big screen - is the third-best selling console in history.\n\nIts sequel the Switch 2, which released in June 2025, has already sold 10 million units in its first few months.\n\nIt's not a fight PlayStation is giving up though.\n\n\"We're always about new innovation in the category,\" Mr Lempel said.\n\nThe success of Nintendo's hardware perhaps inspired Sony to release the PlayStation Portal, an accessory which lets you stream from a PS5 you already own.\n\nMr Lempel said Portal was \"performing really well\" and though he did not reveal exact sales figures, he said it had \"exceeded our expectations\".\n\n\"It's been a very successful product for us,\" he said.\n\nMr Dring said he believed there was another difference in the way games were being released now which might contribute to the length of time between hardware releases.\n\n\"Some of the biggest games today are still playable on PS4, and for the first three years it was relatively rare to see any PS5-only releases,\" he said.\n\n\"The games dominating the most played charts are titles like Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty: Warzone... games that are, in some cases, over 10 years old and are playable on much older devices.\n\n\"So it might be we are going to get a new console in 2027 - but the likelihood is that most of the games that will be launching alongside that device will be fully playable on existing hardware, too.\"\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

It will continue to bedevil President Trump, especially as the midterm elections draw closer.\n\nThe burden is now on Mr. Trump and Republicans to bring down costs or risk peril in the those elections, after a splinter group of Democrats agreed to end the shutdown by dropping their party’s demand to extend certain health insurance subsidies. Despite repeated promises to offer an alternative to Obamacare, Mr. Trump has nothing much to show on the issue, beyond a vague plan to send money directly to policyholders.\n\n“We want a health care system where we pay the money to the people instead of the insurance companies,” he told reporters in the Oval Office Monday. “We’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time.”\n\nMr. Trump’s statement highlights the pressure on Republicans to articulate their own vision to improve the affordability of health care now that the subsidies that millions of people rely on to pay for coverage are set to expire by the end of the year. Like Mr. Trump, Republicans in Congress who have spent years attacking Obamacare have not offered up a serious alternative, since their failed effort to repeal the law in 2017.\n\nThe White House declined to provide more details of Mr. Trump’s latest idea. But the proposal assumes that giving patients a bigger role in purchasing their own care will lead to lower costs and better health outcomes.\n\nThe evidence that such an approach could significantly lower costs is not strong. Most health spending goes to very sick people who don’t have much choice in the care they receive. Research suggests that financial incentives and information about prices can shape behavior for patients seeking elective care. But that kind of spending is a small share of the country’s health care bill.\n\nMillions of Americans who will lose access to subsidies when the current formula expires are looking at a jump in premiums, in some cases hundreds of dollars a month or more. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that two million Americans will lose insurance altogether next year as the prices rise Mr. Trump seems to be arguing that the subsidy money should not be used to help people buy insurance, but rather be offered to the same people in special accounts.\n\nExtending the extra subsidies would be expensive, costing $23 billion next year and nearly $350 billion over the next decade, according to the budget office estimate. But even without them, most consumers can still get some help paying their insurance premiums through tax credits established under Obamacare.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010, has been attacked since its inception for failing to constrain health costs, which are higher in the United States than in other rich democracies. But its expansion of health coverage to tens of millions of Americans who would otherwise lack coverage has made the law popular.\n\nDemocrats expanded funding for people who buy their own insurance during the pandemic, leading to a surge in new insurance signups. It is these added subsidies that are on the line now.\n\nDemocrats have embraced health care costs as a central issue this year, mindful of Mr. Trump’s first term when he tried — and failed — to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nIt was an early and messy defeat for him. Republicans in Congress, who had rallied around the cause for nearly a decade, were unable to agree on a substitute. Democrats ran campaigns focused on the legislative debacle and took back the House the next year.\n\nDuring his campaign last year, Mr. Trump barely talked about health reform. When asked about Obamacare during the presidential debate, he said he would be open to adjusting it “if we can come up with a plan that’s going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care.”\n\nWhen pressed on whether he had a specific proposal in mind, Mr. Trump said he had “concepts of a plan.”\n\nDemocrats forced the government shutdown over health care costs, insisting that Republicans extend extra subsidies that help people pay their insurance premiums and that Republicans reverse the recent cuts they made to Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans have said such an extension does not belong on a spending measure, and some have argued that Congress should let the subsidies expire.\n\nThe handful of Democratic senators who agreed over the weekend to end the shutdown extracted a promise from Republican leadership for at least a symbolic vote on extending the subsidies next month. But the effort has succeeded in thrusting the challenges Americans face in paying for their health care into the political spotlight at a time when Mr. Trump would prefer to focus on other things.\n\nFor the most part, Mr. Trump’s policy efforts on health care have tended to focus on ancillary issues, such as improving the transparency of health care prices, reducing the supply of illegal fentanyl, and requiring drug companies to offer discounts to patients who buy prescription drugs with their own money.\n\nHis health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has had little to say about how to improve the affordability of insurance coverage, and instead often focuses his attention on topics like vaccines or encouraging a healthier diet.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have floated some ideas. Their major tax and domestic policy bill cut nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid — about half by scaling back Obamacare’s expansion of coverage to the working poor. Some lawmakers continue to talk about Obamacare replacement approaches, though the issue has lost prominence in recent years. This week, Senators Rick Scott, of Florida and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed enthusiasm in proposals similar to Mr. Trump’s idea.\n\nMr. Trump supported the health care cuts passed this summer, but he frequently downplayed the scale of the changes, inaccurately saying they were narrowly aimed at eliminating fraud.\n\nMr. Trump’s newly articulated proposal shares a consumerist bent with those policies, by replacing insurance subsidies with cash payments to individuals. It appears to echo a recent proposal made by Mr. Cassidy, who suggested taking the expiring subsidy money and giving it to consumers in the form of a “pre-funded flexible savings account,” which can only be used to pay medical bills.\n\nBut Dr. Cassidy’s plan would account for around $350 billion in spending over the next decade, not “trillions and trillions” of dollars that Mr. Trump has spoken about.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/flights-canceled-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:29:57-05:00","title":"Duffy Won’t Give Timeline to Restore Flights as Shutdown Appears Near End","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown appears to near its end, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy refuses to provide a timeline for restoring flight operations at 40 busy airports, warning that failure to pass funding legislation could result in widespread flight cancellations and even airline fleet groundings.

transportation, on Tuesday refused to say when he would roll back the restrictions on flights at 40 busy airports, even with an apparent end to the government shutdown on the horizon.\n\nInstead, he offered a sharp warning: If the House did not follow the Senate’s lead and pass the bill quickly, not only would the flying public experience major delays and cancellations by the weekend, but some airlines might even ground their fleets.\n\n“In my conversations with the airlines and with the F.A.A., and what we’re seeing with air traffic controllers — we feel there’s going to be significant issues in the airspace,” Mr. Duffy said, referring to the Federal Aviation Administration, at a news conference at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.\n\nIf the government does not open soon, he added, “you might have airlines that will say, ‘We’re going to ground our planes. We’re not going to keep flying anymore,’” predicting that such a disruption could happen even before the Thanksgiving travel rush, perhaps as soon as this weekend.\n\nThroughout the shutdown, Mr. Duffy has warned of impending chaos, drawing rebukes from Democrats that his forecasts were more about pressuring them to end the shutdown than offering impartial assessments of the air-travel system.\n\nLast week, Mr. Duffy and the F.A.A. ordered mandatory flight reductions at 40 airports nationwide. The cuts, which began with a 4 percent reduction on Friday and were slated to rise to 10 percent by the end of the week, were based on the F.A.A.’s analysis of data, Mr. Duffy has said, and were imposed to alleviate strain on air traffic controllers, who have been increasingly struggling with absences in their ranks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Duffy said he would reverse the restrictions only if that data — which includes the frequency of close calls between planes and of delays forced by shortages of air traffic controllers — improved.\n\nControllers have been forced to work without pay through the shutdown, and have missed two full paychecks since the funding lapse began. The lack of pay has accelerated retirements, Mr. Duffy said, and has forced some newer controllers with lower salaries and smaller savings accounts to seek outside income.\n\nThe resulting shortfall of controllers led to an uptick in delays caused by low staffing, known as staffing triggers, at some control towers, according to Mr. Duffy and the controllers’ union, exacerbating already crippling problems. For years, most certified controllers have been forced to work overtime to compensate for vacancies in more than 20 percent of their positions.\n\nLast weekend, a high number of staffing triggers — 81 on Saturday alone — signaled how much worse it could get if the shutdown dragged into the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel season. But on Tuesday, there were signs of marked improvement, Mr. Duffy said, with only four staffing triggers as of 4 p.m.\n\n“I think our air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown and are feeling more hopeful,” Mr. Duffy said, adding, “If the House does their work tomorrow, I think we’re well on our way to getting to more normal air travel, less cancellations.”\n\nMr. Duffy said that air traffic controllers would receive approximately 70 percent of their missed pay within 24 to 48 hours of the shutdown ending, and the rest within a week. He also endorsed President Trump’s proposal, issued on social media on Monday, to reward controllers who never missed a shift during the shutdown with a $10,000 bonus.\n\n“Brilliant,” Mr. Duffy said of Mr. Trump’s proposal, adding that perhaps the controllers with perfect attendance “should come to the White House and he should present them with their checks.”\n\nBut Mr. Duffy did not endorse Mr. Trump’s simultaneous exhortation to air traffic controllers who had missed shifts during the shutdown to quit.\n\n“I’m trying to bring more air traffic controllers in,” Mr. Duffy said. “I’m not trying to take controllers out.”\n\nHe said he reserved his concern for controllers who called in sick before even missing a first paycheck. “I’m concerned about their dedication,” Mr. Duffy said, adding: “If we have controllers who were systemically not doing their job, we will take action.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/bishops-coakley-immigration.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:29:01-05:00","title":"U.S. Bishops Elect New Leader as Concerns Mount Over Treatment of Migrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During their annual meeting in Baltimore, the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops elected Archbishop Paul S.

commercial shipping on Monday, but the truce could weaken Washington’s efforts to curb China’s rise as a maritime power.\n\nPresident Trump had recently started imposing fees on Chinese commercial ships when they docked in American ports. The policy was designed to limit the use of Chinese vessels for transporting goods to the United States.\n\nChina retaliated with similar levies on American vessels. But the countries agreed to suspend the fees for a year as part of their recent trade pact. They announced on Monday that fee collection had stopped.\n\nThe decision to halt the fees showed that Mr. Trump’s efforts to revive American shipyards, which produce almost no large commercial vessels, face obstacles. He has promised a maritime action plan, due last week, to support shipyards and train up mariners.\n\nChina made 60 percent of the world’s large vessels in 2024, up from 44 percent five years earlier, according to BRS Shipbrokers. China has produced over 700 large commercial vessels this year and the United States just one, according to BRS.\n\nChina’s shipyards, benefiting from significant government support, have in recent years overtaken those of South Korea and Japan, two big shipbuilding nations.\n\nThe United States imposed fees not just on Chinese shipping companies, which had been expected to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in levies, but also on large vessels made in China. Many of the largest shipping companies that transport goods to the United States — like France’s CMA CGM — own vessels made in China.\n\nThe U.S. fees stemmed from a trade investigation that began under the Biden administration, and they had bipartisan support. Their supporters criticized the Trump administration for putting them on hold.\n\n“We want to blunt China’s dominance of this industry,” said Michael Roberts, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a right-leaning research organization. “So it’s a disappointment in that respect.”\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a statement that China’s unfair policies had undercut American shipbuilding workers. “Instead of holding China accountable, the president folded, leaving American workers behind,” she added.\n\nThe White House did not respond when asked why it had halted the fees, and whether it had given up too much.\n\nAsked when Mr. Trump’s maritime action plan might appear, Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said the president had established an “Office of Shipbuilding” and to “stay tuned!”\n\nSupporters of the fees hoped that they would deter shipping companies from buying the Chinese vessels and thus push ship orders to South Korea, Japan and, eventually, the United States.\n\nThe ultimate fate of the fees is not clear. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, the agency that formulated the policy, said on Sunday that it would negotiate with China over the issues raised in the investigation that had led to the fees.\n\n“While taking these actions, the United States will continue its domestic efforts and its discussions with key allies and partners on revitalizing American shipbuilding,” the office said in a news release.\n\nA bill in Congress aimed at improving American commercial shipbuilding — called the SHIPS for America Act — intended to use the fees on Chinese ships to subsidize the creation of a new fleet of American cargo vessels.\n\nAsked where the money to finance the fleet would come from if the fee revenue did not exist, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the legislation envisioned other ways to raise money.\n\n“Regardless of whether this suspension moves forward, the SHIPS Act is critical to rebuilding America’s commercial shipping industry and vital to our national security,” Mr. Young said in a statement.\n\nAmerican ships can cost as much as four times those made in Asia, and, as a result, there is little demand for them. The shipping companies that buy large American vessels do so essentially because they have to. The companies transport goods from one American port to another, voyages that, under U.S. law, must be done by American-made ships crewed by Americans.\n\nBut there are signs that Mr. Trump’s shipbuilding push is gaining some traction.\n\nCompanies from South Korea say they intend to make ships in the United States and invest in American shipyards. Hanwha, a South Korean conglomerate, has said it wants to expand the shipyard in Philadelphia that it bought last year.\n\nWhen retaliating against the American shipping fees, China said it had put five American subsidiaries of Hanwha on its sanctions list, accusing them of “supporting and assisting” the United States in its moves in the shipbuilding industry.\n\nOn Monday, China said it was suspending the sanctions on the Hanwha entities for a year.\n\n“We are aware of China’s Ministry of Commerce’s announcement, and we will continue to work to deliver for our maritime customers around the world,” James Hewitt, a spokesman for Hanwha Global Defense, said in a statement.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/politics/marco-rubio-equatorial-guinea.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:05:00-05:00","title":"Senator Criticizes Rubio for Paying $7.5 Million to Equatorial Guinea to Take Deportees","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, has raised serious ethical and human rights concerns over the U.S. government's $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea to accept deportees who are not U.S. citizens.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio for paying $7.5 million to the government of Equatorial Guinea to agree to take deportees from the United States who are not its citizens.\n\nThe senator, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to Mr. Rubio on Monday saying that the “highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe $7.5 million is by far the largest payment the Trump administration is known to have made to another government to take deportees who are not its citizens.\n\nMs. Shaheen noted that Transparency International, a research group, ranked Equatorial Guinea 173 out of 180 countries for corruption. And the State Department itself said in its 2023 human rights report that the country’s “president and members of his inner circle continued to amass personal fortunes from the revenues associated with monopolies on all domestic commercial ventures” and that “corruption at all levels of government was a severe problem.”\n\nA State Department report from 2025 on human trafficking pointed to multiple “credible sources” who had said government officials were involved in trafficking, including for sex.\n\n“I have serious concerns over whether, without appropriate oversight mechanisms and guardrails, a direct payment to Equatorial Guinea’s government could be used to facilitate human trafficking,” Ms. Shaheen wrote. “I am also concerned about what protections are in place to ensure that third-country nationals removed to Equatorial Guinea are themselves not vulnerable to human trafficking, smuggling or human rights abuses.”\n\nWhen asked about Ms. Shaheen’s statements, the State Department declined to comment on its arrangement with Equatorial Guinea, saying it did not want to reveal details of “diplomatic communications with other governments.”\n\n“Implementing the Trump administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” it said in a statement. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”\n\nIn one of its most contentious policies, the Trump administration has aggressively tried to deport a wide range of immigrants from the United States. Mr. Rubio has ordered diplomats to try to forge agreements with other nations to take deportees who are not their citizens.\n\nA New York Times investigation that was based mostly on reviews of U.S. diplomatic cables and other federal documents found that, as of June, American officials had approached at least 58 governments about this effort. Many of the nations that were asked to take deportees had records of persistent human rights abuses and torture. Equatorial Guinea was one of them.\n\nThe State Department has agreed to make large payments in some cases. It paid Rwanda $100,000 to take an Iraqi man and was discussing further arrangements with the country. Most notably, it agreed to pay El Salvador $4.76 million to take up to 300 deportees whom the Trump administration accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang, according to a court filing.\n\nThe men, at least some of whom had no clear ties to any gang, were put into a notorious prison. The Times found many suffered physical and mental abuse there.\n\nIn her letter, Ms. Shaheen noted that the $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea was staggering compared to previous foreign assistance given to the country. Over the past two administrations, the most aid money the United States ever gave to the country was $2 million in a year. The most given in one year by the first Trump administration was $780,000. The current amount given exceeds the sum of the past eight years of payments.\n\nAnd in previous years, the United States did not give the aid directly to the government, with the exception of limited medical supplies. It sent the assistance to vetted partners that included nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations.\n\nThe $7.5 million payment is from a fund set up by Congress for the U.S. government to help with migrant and refugee issues, and specifically to help resettle those in need.\n\nThe ruling family of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, has been widely accused of corruption.\n\nTeodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of the president and a vice president who is the expected successor, was convicted by a French court in 2017 of embezzling millions of dollars of public money that allowed him to lead a lavish lifestyle in Paris. The court imposed a suspended prison sentence of three years and a suspended fine of 30 million euros, or about $35 million.\n\nOn Sept. 29, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, met with Mr. Obiang Mangue in Washington after the State Department had given him a waiver on corruption sanctions to travel to the United States during the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. The State Department said the two officials “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration and advance security cooperation.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-extremist-attack-west-bank.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:33:56-05:00","title":"Israel Arrests 4 After Jewish Extremist Attack in Occupied West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent incident on November 11, 2025, four Israelis were arrested after a coordinated attack by masked extremists in the West Bank’s industrial zone between Nablus and Tulkarem.

Over the weekend, Israeli settlers wielding stones and clubs assaulted a group of Palestinians who had sought to harvest olives from their groves. A Reuters journalist and a security adviser were also assaulted, according to the news agency.\n\n“We used to see them attack in bands of three or four,” said Mr. Daghlas, the Nablus governor. “Now they’re in crowds.”\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 264 settler attacks in October caused casualties, property damage or both — the highest monthly toll in nearly two decades. The U.N.’s humanitarian affairs office in Jerusalem, which collected the data, warned of “a sharp rise in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, both in frequency and severity.”\n\nPalestinian and Israeli human rights groups often say that the Israeli government turns a blind eye to the violence. They say Israeli soldiers and police who disperse the clashes frequently leave without detaining the assailants or arrest only Palestinians.\n\nAnd relatively few of the alleged Israeli perpetrators are ever indicted, let alone convicted, rights groups say.\n\nMr. al-Juneidi, the warehouse owner, later accompanied the Israeli police and military as they examined the scene. He said he hoped they brought the perpetrators to justice, but noted that this rarely happens.\n\nYesh Din, an Israeli rights group that examined more than 1,700 police investigations into offenses committed by Israelis against Palestinians in the West Bank from 2005 to 2024, found that more than 93 percent of cases were closed with no indictment filed.\n\nIsaac Herzog, the Israeli president, condemned the assailants for attacking “civilians and Israeli soldiers,” saying they had crossed “a red line.” He said that the attacks had been carried by a “violent and dangerous few.”\n\nThe assaults even drew criticism from one of Israel’s top settler leaders, Israel Ganz, the head of the Yesha Council, a settler umbrella organization. Mr. Ganz condemned the attack.\n\n“I back up the Israeli military and the police in arresting the anarchists who harmed soldiers and civilians,” Mr. Ganz said in a statement. “Anyone who takes the law into their own hands and harms others should be punished under the law.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-ron-dermer-resigns-netanyahu.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:43:31-05:00","title":"Key Netanyahu Minister Steps Down From Israel’s Government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ron Dermer, a long-serving strategic advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and minister of strategic affairs, has resigned from the government following a two-year tenure that spanned a critical period in Israel’s history, including the aftermath of the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.

Israel’s Government\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T18:43:31-05:00\n\nIsrael’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, a key confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a central figure in shaping Israel’s policies during the Gaza war, submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Dermer, who had been signaling his intention to depart from the government for several months, said he had pledged to his family that he would serve in the position for two years, but stayed longer to work with Mr. Netanyahu during what he called a “critical” period in Israel’s history.\n\n“This government will be defined both by the attack on October 7th,” Mr. Dermer wrote, and by the prosecution of the multifront war that followed. Mr. Dermer was referring to the Hamas-led assault that ignited the devastating war in Gaza.\n\nThe resignation comes about one month after the last of the living hostages in Gaza were returned to Israel as part of a cease-fire deal with Hamas and as the remains of most of the deceased captives have now been turned over.\n\nAs one of Netanyahu’s closest aides, Mr. Dermer, 54, led Israel’s cease-fire negotiations with Hamas and helped secure American support for joint airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, leaving an outsized mark on the country’s war strategy.\n\nMr. Dermer is a polarizing figure in Israel. While some see him as instrumental in securing the recent cease-fire deal, others believe he helped Mr. Netanyahu prolong the war for the prime minister’s own political survival.\n\nThe Israeli military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It has also led to widespread privation and hunger and has destroyed much of the enclave.\n\nThe war brought in Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israel also struck in Syria and conducted extensive raids in the West Bank throughout the war.\n\nMr. Dermer thanked Mr. Netanyahu for the opportunity to serve him “closely” and for trusting him “to handle the most significant issues facing Israel at this critical time.”\n\nHe praised Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership in his letter, writing, “Standing up to both internal and external pressures, you wisely navigated Israel through this war, standing firm to protect our vital interests when necessary and showing flexibility when those same vital interests required it,” Mr. Dermer wrote.\n\nThe international Criminal Court has issued a warrant for Mr. Netanayhu’s arrest for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, allegations that Mr. Netanyahu denies.\n\nMr. Dermer, who moved to Israel from the United States as an adult, previously served as Israel’s ambassador to the United States between 2013 and 2021, working with both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nIn 2022, he continued helping Mr. Netanyahu’s diplomatic efforts, taking on the role as Israel’s strategic affairs minister, many times leading relations with the Biden and later Trump administrations, as well as other countries. He also played a key role in hostage negotiations with Hamas, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States.\n\nA native of Miami Beach, Fla., Mr. Dermer is the son of a former Democratic mayor of the city. He moved to Israel after graduate school, never serving in the Israeli military, which is mandatory for most Israeli citizens.\n\nHe has advised the prime minister since 2000 and, in a sign of their close ties, was once described as “Bibi’s Brain,” a reference to Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname, Bibi, by the online magazine Tablet, which is focused on Jewish culture.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, Mr. Dermer developed a relationship with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and former Middle East adviser. In the past year, the two worked closely together on advancing a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nMr. Dermer said in his resignation letter that he is not sure what his next steps will be.\n\nIn a post on social media, the prime minister on Wednesday thanked Mr. Dermer for his “tremendous help” to him and the state of Israel. “I am sure you have much more to contribute in the future,” Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/arts/cleto-escobedo-dead-jimmy-kimmel-live.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:34:13-05:00","title":"Cleto Escobedo III, Jimmy Kimmel’s Bandleader, Dies at 59","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleto Escobedo III, a saxophonist and longtime house band leader of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' since its 2003 launch, died at age 59.

comedian Jimmy Kimmel led to a decades-long role as the leader of the house band on Mr. Kimmel’s late night show, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” died on Tuesday. He was 59.\n\nMr. Kimmel announced the death on Instagram. He did not cite a cause or say where Mr. Escobedo had died.\n\nMr. Escobedo’s band, Cleto and the Cletones, has been with “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” since the show’s inception in 2003, but his association with Mr. Kimmel dated to their time growing up together in Las Vegas.\n\n“Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was 9 years old,” Mr. Kimmel wrote on Instagram. “The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true.”\n\nIn a 2013 interview with Variety, Mr. Kimmel recalled that Mr. Escobedo was a “musical prodigy.”\n\n“When ABC offered me my show, I prayed that they’d let me hire Cleto, and to my amazement they agreed, sight unseen,” Mr. Kimmel said. To ensure that the network would stick with the band, Mr. Kimmel said he had taken ABC executives — including Lloyd Braun, the chairman of the network’s entertainment division at the time — to see Mr. Escobedo’s ensemble play live.\n\n“They were blown away, and they loved the idea that he’s my best friend and that his dad’s also in the band,” Mr. Kimmel told Variety.\n\nCleto Valentine Escobedo III was born Aug. 23, 1966, in Las Vegas, the only child of Sylvia Escobedo and Cleto Escobedo Jr. The elder Mr. Escobedo was also a saxophonist who would later join his son in the Cletones, and Mr. Escobedo said his father’s influence had been a driving force in his decision to become a musician.\n\n“There was music everywhere,” he said of his childhood in an interview with the podcast “The Jake Feinberg Show” last year. “I distinctly remember my dad was playing in Hawaii. I was 5 years old and watching his band and him play, and I used to get teared up watching my dad play. I was so excited by the music of it all.”\n\nMr. Escobedo was studying at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, when he began gigging along the Las Vegas Strip. His first big break came in 1990, when he landed an audition to join Paula Abdul’s touring band. A world tour with Ms. Abdul led to a record deal with Virgin Records, and tours with other artists, including Luis Miguel and Marc Anthony. He was touring with Mr. Anthony when he got a call from Mr. Kimmel asking him to lead the band on his new show, Mr. Escobedo recalled in an oral history interview with Texas Tech University in 2022.\n\nMr. Escobedo described the early days of his friendship with Mr. Kimmel as full of mischief — a sign of things to come.\n\n“We used to order cabs for people on our block, like, really late,” Mr. Escobedo recalled. “I don’t know, we used to all do the normal crank calls.”\n\nBut mostly, he said, the duo “mainly liked to just watch a bunch of comedy stuff, and we were big David Letterman fans when we were kids, so we’d watch a lot of that.”\n\nMr. Kimmel paid tribute to Mr. Escobedo on his show when Mr. Escobedo turned 50. Their “lifetime of friendship,” he said, “was highlighted by the kind of torture” that only ”an older brother can inflict on you without getting arrested.”\n\nBy the time Mr. Kimmel hired Mr. Escobedo as his bandleader, Mr. Escobedo’s father had retired from playing and was working backstage at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Mr. Kimmel suggested that his friend bring the elder Mr. Escobedo into the band. Playing on the television show became a family affair.\n\n“I’m in seventh heaven every night,” Cleto Escobedo Jr. told The San Antonio Express-News in 2013, adding in reference to Mr. Kimmel: “I’m playing music with my son on a show with my other son. If I screw up a couple notes, Cleto won’t fire me. There’s not another son and dad on late-night TV.”\n\nMr. Escobedo’s survivors include his parents; his wife, Lori; and his children, Cruz and Jesse.\n\nThe younger Mr. Escobedo’s boyhood friendship with Mr. Kimmel made him a staple on one of the longest-running comedy institutions in television.\n\n“There’s only a handful of these gigs in this country,” he told Texas Tech University, “so I’m very fortunate to have one.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/opinion/antisemitic-politics-carlson-fuentes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:00:05-05:00","title":"Meet the New Antisemites, Same as the Old Antisemites","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article investigates the resurgence of antisemitism within American conservative politics, particularly following Tucker Carlson’s controversial interview with Hitler enthusiast Nick Fuentes.

That includes Senator Ted Cruz, who called out his fellow Republicans for being too timid to condemn Carlson; The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, which denounced “this poison in their own ranks”; and Heritage Foundation people who resigned in disgust after Kevin Roberts, the organization’s president, offered a lickspittle apologia for Carlson. Even Roberts felt compelled to disavow his own performance, though he persisted in describing Carlson as “my friend.”\n\nThe bad news is that none of this is going away anytime soon. If ever.\n\nAntisemitism was supposedly banished twice from the conservative universe: first in the 1950s, when William F. Buckley Jr. decreed that nobody on the masthead of the antisemitic American Mercury would appear in the pages of his own National Review; second in the 1990s, when he said it was “impossible to defend” Pat Buchanan from charges of antisemitism. Such was Buckley’s prestige on the right that none other than Carlson issued his own denunciation of Buchanan: “I’m not hysterical on the subject,” he said on C-SPAN’s “Washington Journal” in 1999, “but I do believe that there is a pattern with Pat Buchanan of needling the Jews.”\n\nNow the Heritage Foundation and various conservative publications are pressing the Trump administration to award an unrepentant Buchanan the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The notion that Winston Churchill, not the German Führer, was the villain in World War II — another of Buchanan’s hobbyhorses — is again gaining ground on the right. Buchanan’s obsessive loathing of Israel, along with his conviction that the pro-Israel lobby dictates U.S. foreign policy, is also gaining ground — a mirror image of the views of the anti-Israel left and a reminder of the French aphorism “Les extrêmes se touchent.” Extremes meet.\n\nHow did this happen? Cynicism is one reason. “The fact that antisemitism is the socialism of fools is an argument not against, but for, antisemitism; given the fact that there is such an abundance of fools, why should one not steal that very profitable thunder?” Leo Strauss, the philosopher, observed in 1962. Bluntly, his point was that a bigotry for morons — a.k.a., “The Jews did it” — will always be political gold in a world of morons. Candace Owens, the right-wing podcaster, gets this: Her popularity has soared as her Jew-hatred has become more overt.\n\nA second factor is the forced merger of Christianity with conservatism.\n\nMainstream American conservatives used to believe our sacred texts were the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution; “Reflections on the Revolution in France” and “The Road to Serfdom.” Now it’s the New Testament. We once thought that religious convictions should be a little more respected in our secular Republic. Now this is supposed to be a Christian regime that tolerates Jews. (Others, not so much.) When Carlson, speaking at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, compared the slain conservative to Christ brought down by “a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus thinking about, ‘What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us?’” the inference could have been lost on nobody. Among conservatives, he paid virtually no price for it.\n\nThen there’s political ideology. The MAGA movement is not antisemitic. But many of its core convictions are antisemitic-adjacent — that is, they have a habit of leading in an anti-Jewish direction.\n\nOpposition to free trade, or to a welcoming immigration policy, or to international law that crimps national sovereignty, are legitimate, if often wrongheaded, political positions. But they have a way of melding with hoary stereotypes about “the International Jew” working across borders against the interests of so-called real Americans. You can be sure that, somewhere on social media, someone will respond to this column by pointing out that my Kishinev-born grandfather changed his name from Ehrlich to Stephens — evidence, supposedly, of sneakiness in my DNA. It’s the type of right-wing identity politics you inevitably get where the question of where you are from matters more than the question of where you are trying to go.\n\nFinally, it bears reminding that antisemitism isn’t merely a prejudice. It’s a conspiracy theory about Jews. Who actually killed Christ? Or brought on the bubonic plague? Or got America embroiled in unnecessary wars in the Middle East? Or replaces American workers with cheap immigrant labor? The idea that modern politics amounts to a malicious scheme organized by an insidious cabal of deep-state insiders and globalists at the expense of ordinary people is now received wisdom on the right, paralleling far-left convictions about the purported evils of Zionists and their billionaire backers.\n\nJews don’t have the luxury of being indifferent to either threat. The tsunami of progressive antisemitism that hit after Oct. 7 is being followed by another wave, just as tall.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

already-reeling British broadcaster into uncharted territory. For its American media counterparts, being threatened by the litigious president is familiar terrain.\n\nThe record of Mr. Trump’s litigation in the United States offers both hope and warning to the BBC, which has been convulsed by the resignation of two top executives, and by uncomfortable questions about its journalism.\n\nAs in some of the American cases, lawyers said, Mr. Trump would face formidable hurdles if a suit ever went to trial. He would have to persuade a court that a misleadingly edited clip in a BBC documentary caused him to “suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” as his lawyer claimed in a letter to the BBC on Sunday.\n\nWhile the broadcaster has yet to issue a formal reply to Mr. Trump, its board chair, Samir Shah, has apologized for the splicing together of footage of the president’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, in a way that suggested a more direct link between his words and the insurrection at the Capitol hours later.\n\nThat concession, lawyers said, may weaken the BBC’s position somewhat. But there are other factors that suggest it would still be hard for Mr. Trump to prevail over the BBC in a Florida court, which is where his lawyer, Alejandro Brito, indicated he would file the suit.\n\nMost important, perhaps, two senior executives who had oversight of the BBC Panorama film, “Trump: A Second Chance?”, both said they believed it never aired in the United States. They asked for anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly. The BBC did not respond to a question about where the documentary was distributed.\n\nIf the executives are right, that could allow the BBC’s lawyers to argue that Florida is the wrong jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n“The court in Florida may potentially rule that the proper jurisdiction is England and Wales, as that is where the vast majority of viewers saw the broadcast,” said Daniel Taylor, a media lawyer at the London firm Taylor Hampton.\n\nThe problem for Mr. Trump is that in Britain, where the film aired in October 2024, he has missed the 12-month statute of limitations for filing a libel suit. Britain would have been a less attractive venue, in any event, because the maximum damages awarded in such cases is capped at about 300,000 pounds, or $395,000.\n\n“Obviously, the damages he can claim would be much higher in the U.S.,” Mr. Taylor said.\n\nEven if Mr. Trump survived a jurisdictional challenge, lawyers said he would face a high bar in proving that the BBC showed “actual malice” in splicing the footage of his speech — the standard for a libel judgment in American law. To do so, his lawyers would need to obtain evidence, like internal emails or texts, from the BBC and the production company, October Films, through a discovery process.\n\nThe BBC, in turn, would be entitled to demand from Mr. Trump evidence of the financial or reputational harm the broadcast caused him. It is far from clear, lawyers said, that the president would welcome that.\n\n“There would need to be a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the key players involved in the editing published the falsehood deliberately or acted with a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity,” said RonNell Anderson Jones, a professor of law at the University of Utah.\n\nBeyond the BBC’s actions, lawyers said, Mr. Trump would also need to demonstrate that the editing of the film substantially altered the way people viewed the events of Jan. 6, 2021, which began with the president rallying supporters in front of the White House and ended with crowds rampaging on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe BBC acknowledged that the footage was edited to take separate statements by the president — “We’re going walk down to the Capitol,” and “We fight. We fight like hell” — which were uttered about 50 minutes apart, and made them sound like a single statement that could be interpreted as a call to arms.\n\nBBC News has said it did not intend to mislead anyone. It said in a statement that its editing meant “to convey the key messages of the speech in a condensed format, since the whole speech was over an hour long.”\n\nLegal experts noted that multiple documentary accounts of Jan. 6 suggested that the president incited the crowd to attack the Capitol, a conclusion endorsed by the House of Representatives, when it voted to impeach the president on a count of “incitement of insurrection.”\n\n“There is a plausible argument that it did not alter the meaning of what he said during that speech,” said Lee Levine, a first amendment lawyer who has represented media companies, including the BBC and The New York Times.\n\nMr. Levine said the BBC’s admission of an “error in judgment” in the editing of the film would make it difficult for the broadcaster to dismiss Mr. Trump’s complaints out of hand. But he said previous lawsuits show that the president is often less interested in a legal victory than a lucrative settlement.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump sued The New York Times and three of its reporters for $15 billion for what he claimed were false and malicious stories about him that appeared in the newspaper. He also sued Penguin Random House, the publisher of a book written by two Times reporters.\n\nJudge Steven D. Merryday, of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, initially rejected the complaint, saying a complaint “is not a public forum for vituperation and invective.”\n\nIn some of his actions against media companies, Mr. Levine said, Mr. Trump has been able to wield the threat of other government action — legal or regulatory — to compel them to settle even dubious cases.\n\nIn July, Paramount Global, the owner of CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle Mr. Trump’s lawsuit against the CBS News program “60 Minutes” for the way it edited an interview with Kamala Harris in 2024, when she was the vice president and Democratic presidential nominee. At the time, Paramount and Skydance were seeking federal regulatory approval for a merger — approval that came later that month.\n\nWhile the BBC does not have major business operations in the United States, it does have a network of news bureaus and its programs are carried on BBC America, a cable channel owned by AMC Networks. With its partial public funding in Britain, it also has quasi-state status, which Mr. Trump could use to pressure the British government.\n\nThe Times and other media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, have fought lawsuits or threats of suits from Mr. Trump. But Mr. Levine noted that in Britain, where libel cases are easier to win, settlements are more common. He represented the BBC in a privacy case in the United States in 1990s, which the broadcaster settled.\n\n“Whereas in the U.S., there is a stigma to a U.S. company settling a defamation suit,” Mr. Levine said. “That’s not the case in the U.K. Media companies in the U.K. settle defamation suits all the time.”\n\nKim Darroch, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Washington during Mr. Trump’s first term, said that given the BBC’s unique stature and funding, the decision of how to respond to the president’s threat of a lawsuit would likely be as much political as legal or commercial.\n\n“I’m not sure, politically, there’s much support in this country for the BBC to whack out a lot of money to Trump,” Mr. Darroch said. But, he added, “This may be the moment for a little abject groveling.”\n\nJane Bradley contributed reporting\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/opinion/mamdani-election-strategy-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:03:00-05:00","title":"Steve Bannon Thinks Zohran Mamdani Is a Genius.

It’s Not a Feint.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T05:03:50-05:00\n\nIt’s only been a week, but the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York last Tuesday raises key questions for those seeking to put the Democratic Party on a winning path.\n\nDid his victory reveal the potential of a movement driven by legions of young, disaffected voters — especially struggling college graduates who are part of the so-called precariat — determined to wrest power from the party’s old-guard establishment and push the party’s platform to the left?\n\nOr will the Mamdani movement deteriorate and fall into the long tradition on the left of flames that all too quickly burn out, another in the list of protest movements that includes Occupy Wall Street, the pink pussy hat resistance and even Black Lives Matter?\n\nLet me say at the outset that I don’t claim to have the answer. I am instinctively pessimistic, based on covering the struggles of liberalism and the left for more than a half-century. That puts me on the side of doubters.\n\nAt the same time, however, key elements of Mamdani’s campaign have enormous potential for a party badly beaten in 2024, one that continues to be held in disdain by much of the electorate, including by many of its own members.\n\nTo an unusual degree, researching and writing this column has changed my thinking, leaving me more impressed with what Mamdani achieved and with the possibilities he has raised for the Democratic Party.\n\nThere is no question that Mamdani demonstrated an extraordinary, if not magical, ability to change the character and composition of the electorate in the nation’s largest city.\n\nThe turnout rate of voters age 18 to 29 rose to 41.3 percent this year from 11.1 percent in the 2021 election for mayor. The share of total turnout composed of 18-to-29-year-olds grew to 16.6 percent from 8.9 percent four years ago\n\nTurnout rose for all groups, but much more among young voters than among voters over 50.\n\nI am not going to try to address two related but unknowable questions — whether a Mamdani administration will succeed and whether Mamdani himself is a potential candidate for higher office. Instead, my focus is specifically on the broader applicability of the Mamdani campaign strategy for the national Democratic Party.\n\nMamdani built an insurgency within the Democratic Party primary electorate first by mobilizing traditionally quiescent young voters — many of whom have found that their B.A.s do not guarantee a good job or any job at all — and then drawing in nonwhite voters and more of the college-educated middle class.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to win for two decades with what came to be known as an upstairs-downstairs coalition of largely white college-educated voters and nonwhite voters of all educational backgrounds.\n\nThe Mamdani movement added two crucial ingredients: anger and moral purpose — and in so doing actually expanded the electorate itself.\n\nIn sharp contrast, say, to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the Mamdani campaign was, in effect, an intraparty insurrection seeking to displace what its backers see as a dysfunctional and failed old guard. It is this semi-revolutionary element that gave the Mamdani campaign its larger moral legitimacy: the reform of a moribund institution.\n\nBy achieving this, Mamdani’s admirers argued, he demonstrated the potential for initiating similar intraparty insurrections elsewhere in the country, campaigns seeking to convert internal discontent from a disadvantage into a tool to awaken and mobilize the electorate:\n\n“Simply put, the Democratic Party is primed for a hostile takeover.” Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, argued in a Substack post right after the election, “Mamdani and the Future of the Democratic Party.”\n\nMamdani has tapped into a new political marketplace for enterprising candidates, Enos contended:\n\nAs talented as Mamdani may be, there are many more people out there with similar talents and who are, like Mamdani, outsiders to the party establishment or will be willing to run as outsiders if this is the path to electoral success.\n\nGiven the national mood and the fact that virtually nobody really likes the Democratic Party, we can anticipate that these politicians will emerge as contenders for various levels of office, perhaps even as the next Democratic presidential nominee. And many, as with Mamdani, will likely be able to overcome establishment forces and gain power.\n\nMamdani’s significance, Enos argued,\n\nlies more in the fact that there was enough enthusiasm for change rooted in dissatisfaction with the status quo and anger at those who perpetuate it, that voters in a major election were willing to elect a true outsider candidate and to work hard enough to do so in the face of enormous establishment resistance.\n\nFrom an entirely different perspective, Steve Bannon, who oversaw Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and remains one of the most powerful voices on the right, sees great potential in the Mamdani campaign.\n\nBannon warned his fellow conservatives, including the president, that they risk self-delusion if they dismiss the significance of Mamdani’s victory. In an interview last Wednesday with Politico, Bannon declared:\n\nPeople better understand they have a fight on their hands. This guy is a serious guy. … The national Republican Party and some of the smartest strategists do not realize the power of the Working Families Party and the [Democratic Socialists of America] for ground game. Modern politics now is about engaging low-propensity voters, and they clearly turned them out tonight, and this is kind of the Trump model. This is very serious.\n\nBannon shares Enos’s view that Mamdani has opened a political window for the left: “You’re going to see a whole new group of Mamdanis in these major urban cities. This is the flower of what the progressive left has delivered over the last 40 or 50 years.”\n\nJohn Mollenkopf, director of CUNY’s Center for Urban Research, has studied the demographics, neighborhood dynamics, immigration patterns and politics of New York for more than four decades.\n\nHe has been impressed by the Mamdani campaign. In a phone interview, Mollenkopf described the mayor-elect as “an exceptionally talented communicator and campaigner, very thoughtful, very smart, very anticipatory about the kinds of criticisms he’s going to get.”\n\nMamdani was deluged with hostile questions throughout the campaign, Mollenkopf pointed out, and “one sign of how talented he is is that he doesn’t react with his gut. He reacts with his brain.”\n\nContrary to critics who argued that Mamdani is too far left, Mollenkopf argued that Mamdani\n\ndid exactly what the centrist critics of the woke Democratic Party said he should do. He constantly stressed kitchen-table issues, affordability, cost of living. He focused on that relentlessly.\n\nHe didn’t say, “I’m bringing socialism to New York.” He didn’t say, you know, “We’re going to seize the means of production.” He said, “We’re going to make your buses free and fast. We’re going to freeze your rent.”\n\nIn other words, “He followed the conservative advice about how Democrats could win.”\n\nMollenkopf argued that as mayor one of Mamdani’s key challenges will be managing and containing the more radical wing of the Democratic Socialists of America, “who think that the election is the road to revolution. Mamdani is going to have to confront those people sooner or later.”\n\nThe get-out-the-vote drive led by D.S.A. organizers was a key factor in Mamdani’s victory, in Mollenkopf’s view:\n\nThey got somewhere between 70 and 110,000 people out in canvassing efforts, both for the primary and for the general election. I’ve never seen anything like it in New York, including the Obama campaigns.\n\nThere is a more ambivalent view of the Mamdani campaign.\n\nZachary Donnini, a graduate student in data science at Harvard and a data adviser to the Yale Youth Poll, captured this equivocality in his prescient June 27 Substack posting, “How Zohran Mamdani Could Deliver the Left’s Most Important Win in Years.”\n\nThe general election “is definitely set to be the left’s biggest win since AOC defeated Joe Crowley, and potentially even bigger,” Donnini wrote,\n\nbut let me play devil’s advocate and throw some cold water on the excitement. It’s nothing new for the left to prove they can win Democratic municipal primaries in the most lefty cities in the country. Sure, this was against a massive disadvantage in name recognition and fund-raising, and N.Y.C. is a much bigger fish to fry that gets far more national media attention.\n\nBut Brandon Johnson won in Chicago just two years ago and now sits at a 6 percent approval rating as mayor. Progressive D.A. George Gascón won in Los Angeles in 2020, only to get absolutely demolished by an independent in 2024, running a staggering 53 points behind fellow Democrat Kamala Harris in the same county. …\n\nThis is shaping up to be the left’s biggest electoral win in forever, but it could all be for nothing (and potentially really damaging to the gaining momentum of the movement) if Mamdani can’t break the recent pattern of his progressive predecessors having spectacularly unsuccessful tenures actually governing.\n\nIn an email, Donnini elaborated:\n\nIt’s worth remembering that New York City is demographically exceptional. Mamdani’s strongest areas (Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and western Queens) represent a concentration of young, progressive voters found in only a handful of places nationwide, like Chicago’s North Side.\n\nWhile his appeal won’t translate everywhere, certain elements are replicable: his social media savvy and focus on affordability clearly resonate with a segment of the electorate. The challenge for Democrats is harnessing that enthusiasm without alienating swing voters in the process.\n\nThere are, of course, a substantial number of Democrats who view the Mamdani campaign as a political and ideological dead end that will collapse in failure, providing ammunition to Trump and his allies on the right.\n\nIn an email, Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist who played a key role guiding the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton to victory, made a detailed case that the moderate strategies adopted by Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, governors-elect of Virginia and New Jersey, offer a far better model for Democratic candidates than Mamdani’s approach:\n\nWe have empirical data after Tuesday. A real-life test case in which Spanberger, a centrist Democrat, flipped a G.O.P.-held governorship in a purple state with a centrist, persuasion-based strategy; while a socialist with a mobilization strategy limped across the finish line, an astonishing 18 points behind Kamala Harris.\n\nBegala argued that the very fact that “Mamdani ran on cost of living and did not focus on the woke white left’s agenda of identity, guilt and grievance” demonstrated the continuing strength of a centrist, pragmatic approach. “If a democratic socialist refuses to run on the far left’s social and cultural elitism, you can be sure it’s dead.”\n\nBegala did acknowledge the success of the Mamdani’s overarching strategic guideline:\n\nKeep it simple, stupid. Free buses. Freeze rent. Free child care. City-owned grocery stores. Tax the rich. Regardless of how you feel about these ideas, each one would fit on a hat.\n\nContrast those slogans with how Kamala Harris summarized her housing policy at an August rally in North Carolina: “As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building three million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class. And we’ll do that together.”\n\nAll that said, Begala continued,\n\nLet me get to the heart of your question: Zohran Mamdani had the weakest win of a successful New York Democrat in 35 years. Fifty-point-four percent is weak. Eric Adams got 67 percent. Bill DeBlasio got 73 percent his first election and 66 percent in his second.\n\nContrast that weakness with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill’s strength. Each outpaced Harris by 4 to 5 percent. It seems to me the question is, why were Spanberger and Sherrill so much stronger than Mamdani — while running in much more challenging terrain than he?\n\nWhile some of Begala’s points are well taken, he misses a strength of Mamdani’s that sets him apart from his fellow Democratic victors on Election Day: He mobilized disgruntled and angry young voters, who have long been seen as the potential to be the party’s sleeping giant.\n\nIn New Jersey, voters 18 to 44 made up 31 percent of the electorate. In Virginia, it was 33 percent. In New York City, it was 40 percent, according to CNN exit polls. Differences of seven or nine percentage points in the composition of the Democratic electorate may seem modest. In practice, they are seismic, with the potential to revitalize an almost lifeless political party.\n\nG. Elliott Morris, a political analyst who publishes his work on Substack at Strength in Numbers, described this aspect of Mamdani’s victory in an essay on Sunday, “The Mamdani Youthquake Suggests a Way for Democrats to Repair Their Brand.”\n\nExamining the election results, Morris wrote, “one chart that really caught my eye,” which showed “the percent of voters participating in New York City’s mayoral election that were less than 45 years old.”\n\nOf the two million voters who cast ballots in person, he continued,\n\n42 percent were under age 45 — a much higher share than in recent mayoral races. In 2021, just 27 percent of those who voted for New York City mayor were under 45.\n\nFirst-time voters also made up an abnormally high 20 percent of the electorate on Tuesday. These new voters broke for Democratic Party and democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani over former governor Andrew Cuomo by a margin of 66 to 30. This group was as pro-Mamdani as young voters, who broke 70 to 25 in his favor.\n\nCrucially, Morris wrote, “Mamdani also won two-thirds of voters with an unfavorable view of both political parties. This is something that Donald Trump managed to do in 2016, 2020 and 2024, as well.”\n\nMaybe, Morris concluded, “the party can learn something from Mamdani’s success in turning out new voters and engaging anti-system voters with an agenda aimed at affordability and the American dream. That is, after all, what most voters say they want out of politics anyway.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
