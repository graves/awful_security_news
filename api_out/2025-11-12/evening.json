What happens next? \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Adelita Grijalva’s swearing in on Wednesday made her Democrats’ newest member in the US House of Representatives and officially set in motion lawmakers’ effort to force a vote on a measure the White House has fought for months: a bill to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n  After her formal swearing in, Grijalva provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  As a refresher, a discharge petition is a critical tool at rank-and-file members’ disposal. Under the arcane procedure, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign one, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joined with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to spearhead this particular discharge petition, but while Grijalva provided the decisive signature, the effort faces a number of hurdles — and the bill is unlikely to become law.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, should it pass the House, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump, who has derided the effort. But the House vote would put lawmakers on the record on the issue, forcing Republicans in particular to choose between siding with Trump or backing the release of files that could shine new light on the crimes of the convicted sex offender.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the steps the House will have to take now that Grijalva has become the 218th signature:\n \n\n   \n    How long does it take to ‘ripen’?\n \n\n   \n  Even with Grijalva’s signature, an additional seven legislative days have to lapse before a member can move to bring the petition to the floor. The week is often referred to as the “ripening” period.\n \n\n   \n  Then, House Speaker Mike Johnson has up to two legislative days to schedule a vote. (But again, calendar days don’t always equal legislative days – the House must be in session.)\n \n\n   \n  That appeared to make the first week of December the earliest the House could actually begin considering a vote to release the Epstein files on the House floor. But in a surprise, Johnson said early Wednesday evening he’d put the measure on the floor next week. As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up to the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n    Can GOP leadership delay or dodge the effort?\n \n\n   \n  If he wanted to, Johnson does have a few maneuvers at his disposal to try to delay or derail the process, including an attempt to table a final vote on the matter or referring it to a committee. But Johnson’s saying the bill will come to the floor next week shows that he wants to bring this up for a vote.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker has previously indicated that if the petition gets 218 signatures, he will allow for a vote. “If they get their signatures, it goes to a vote,” Johnson told reporters last month.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson also called the effort a “moot point” on CNN earlier this week, citing the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein-related investigation and release of thousands of pages of documents.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming the process moves forward, the House would then have to take a series of procedural votes with hours of debate on the House floor before the bill would receive a final vote.\n \n\n   \n  And then, after all that, the bill would still need to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate – a dubious prospect – where 60 votes would be needed for it to advance, if it even got a vote.\n \n\n   \n    Will the Senate consider the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Even if Massie’s bill clears the House, there’s no guarantee it would get a vote in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether the Senate should vote on the bill, the Republican leader said he was “not sure what that achieves.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to force a vote in September on a bill calling for the release of the files, but Senate Republicans killed the measure — with all but two Republicans voting to derail it.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/dana-williamson-indicted-former-california-governor-aide","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:05:00Z","title":"Former Aide to California Governor Indicted for Alleged Theft of Campaign Funds from Ex-Health Secretary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dana Williamson, a former top aide and chief of staff to California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been indicted on 23 federal charges, including bank and wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and falsifying tax returns.

He is not implicated in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra’s dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra’s campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie’s wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n \n\n   \n  When Williamson prepared to join Newsom’s office in late 2022, she arranged for “Co-Conspirator 2” — an unnamed former public official — to take over her role in the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson told the Los Angeles Times that year that she planned to sever financial ties to her company while working for the governor.

She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n \n\n   \n  McCluskie signed a plea deal October 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: “Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”\n \n\n   \n  Becerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson faces 23 charges, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the US Attorney’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Williamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra’s campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom’s chief of staff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"08:12:00-05:00","title":"Johnson says House will vote next week on push to compel DOJ to release all of its Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the U.S. House will vote next week on a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files, following a successful discharge petition by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna.

\nUpdated: \n        8:12 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson announced Wednesday that he would put a ﻿contentious bill compelling the release of all of the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein case files to a vote on the House floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said, adding, “in the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson was required to soon put the bill from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, on the floor after the pair  successfully deployed an arcane tool  in the chamber known as a discharge petition. But he had some leeway to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leaders’ suggestion that he would move more quickly than expected to put the bill before the full House is a reflection of the growing sense of agitation among members of his party on Capitol Hill. The House GOP – which is fiercely loyal to Trump – is not eager to take the vote, which goes against the president’s own wishes. But many members of the party are also sick of the months of growing pressure from some vocal members of their own party, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and feel they need to vote in favor of releasing the files or risk being accused of protecting pedophiles.\n \n\n   \n  “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” a frustrated Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters after he went rogue earlier in the day, taking to the House floor to try to force an expedited vote on the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m tired of messing around. The Democrats have had the Epstein files for four years, and now we’ve got it for nine months, and it’s going to be dragged into a bunch of nonsense. Let’s just take it to the floor. Let’s vote on it. Let’s get on with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The congressman’s push was denied because it did not follow the proper parliamentary procedure.\n \n\n   \n  Political pressure over that high-profile Epstein vote roared back to life on the Hill Wednesday, with House members return to Washington after more than a month away.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva’s afternoon swearing in as the House’s newest member delivered the decisive vote to the discharge petition to force a vote, despite GOP leadership’s opposition and an apparent eleventh-hour  pressure campaign  by the White House to avoid it altogether.\n \n\n   \n  As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up on the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require. But Massie and Khanna used the discharge petition because House GOP leadership did not want the bill to get a vote – leaving many expecting they would have to wait seven legislative days to circumvent leadership and come to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  While the floor schedule for next week has not yet been set, Johnson said leadership wants to bring up the measure “as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it. I mean, they have 218 signatures, that’s fine, we’ll do it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The House Committee on Oversight Committee on Wednesday released an additional 20,000 pages of documents the GOP-led panel had received from the late convicted sex offender’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In emails released as part of the tranche, Epstein, whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence over the last 15 years with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit – details seized on by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, however, brushed aside the  newly public details  when asked about them earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a massive distraction by the Democrats while we’re trying to get the government reopened and cover for their mistakes. I find it interesting that the press corps didn’t ask all these questions for four years during the Biden administration,” Johnson said, when asked whether he had any concerns about the new findings.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed by CNN why Congress shouldn’t release all Epstein documents when the president himself has said he supports doing so, Johnson said: “He is for maximum transparency. He said it as recently as a couple of days ago, and I talked to him about it today. He’s for everything coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Epstein-related pressure builds, two more House Republicans — GOP Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Eli Crane of Arizona — said they plan to vote for the bill to release the files when it comes to the floor. Neither had signed the discharge petition.\n \n\n   \n  Other Republicans, however, remain staunchly opposed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a vote against,” Rep.

Adelita Grijalva is finally sworn in as the House’s newest Democrat, paving way for Epstein files vote \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After 50 days of waiting, Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn into Congress Wednesday, bringing an end to a contentious chapter in the US House of Representatives that included a  lawsuit  and  rising tensions inside the Capitol  over her seating.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson  had said  he would not swear in the Arizona Democrat amid the government shutdown until the House returned to legislative session, a delay that prompted outrage from Democrats. The swearing in took place after the chamber reconvened to vote on a Senate-passed bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Shaking her hand on Wednesday, Johnson described the disagreement over the delay in swearing Grijalva in as “some intense fellowship.”\n \n\n   \n  While she waited to be sworn in, Grijalva had been unable to perform basic constituent services or even open an office in her southern Arizona district. Previously describing herself as a “tourist with an office,” she told CNN that up until Wednesday she hasn’t had a working office phone, an office budget or the ability to use government systems. Residents of the sprawling district had been without a vote in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva was sworn in on the House floor to a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona’s 7th Congressional District elected me to represent them,” Grijalva said on Wednesday. “This is an abuse of power. One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing in of a duly elected member of Congress for a political reason.”\n \n\n   \n  Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva become the decisive 218th member in support of an effort to force the House to vote on the release of all of the Jeffrey Epstein case files, an issue that has roiled the House and sparked division among Republicans. Hours before her signature advanced the effort forward, top Trump administration officials  met with  at least one Republican who had also signed onto the petition.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors were in the gallery to watch Grijalva be sworn in.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we the American people,” Grijalva said. “That is why I will discharge petition right now to release the Epstein files. Justice cannot wait another day.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued that Johnson delayed swearing Grijalva in because she would be the deciding signature that would trigger the floor vote and pointed to other instances where Johnson moved quickly to swear in Republicans who won their special elections. Johnson said Wednesday he’d put the measure requiring Congress to release the Epstein files on the floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that’s different about me and the three other people that this speaker swore in in under 24 hours from the date of their elections is I’m the 218th signer,” Grijalva told CNN last month.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has defended his decision to delay Grijalva’s swearing by arguing that she won her race on September 23 when the House was already out of session and had vowed to swear her in as soon as the House returned.\n \n\n   \n  “I really like this lady. She is going to be an excellent member of Congress. She is a great person,” Johnson told Grijalva on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “She may not agree with me, but we followed the custom of the House on the timetable,” the speaker added. “I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn’t missed a vote and we’re delighted you’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  The House has been out of session since September 19, as Johnson put pressure on Senate Democrats to compromise with Republicans and vote to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown dragged on, the pressure on Johnson to swear in Grijalva mounted. Arizona’s Democratic senators got into a hallway confrontation with Johnson over the issue and other Democrats staged protests outside of the speaker’s office. Arizona’s attorney general even  sued  the House of Representatives over the delay, a move that Johnson  dismissed  as “patently absurd” and a bid for publicity.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva filled the seat vacated by her father, the  late Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva , who represented the district in Congress for more than two decades before  he died  after a battle with cancer in March. Running on the strength of her family name, she sailed to victory in the Democratic primary this summer and then defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the special election, capturing roughly 70% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson complimented Grijalva’s late father and reflected on his time working with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I just told her on the way in that she fills her father’s shoes, or she is going to try, no one can. He was giant around here, served a long time, served his state very well. I served under him on the Natural Resources Committee for awhile, admired the way he did the work, he was tenacious. So, she has a proud family legacy, and we’re delighted to have her here,” Johnson said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  When asked on Wednesday, why it took so long for her to be sworn in, Grijalva said, motioning toward Johnson, “that would not be my question.”\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva has been frustrated by the delay in her swearing in and has said the hardest part about delaying her swearing in was being unable to help her constituents during the longest government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve really missed the opportunity to be able to help constituents that are here that need services. So it’s been very difficult to sit it out while people come up to me and ask me for help,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/louisville-ups-plane-crash-victims","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"All 14 Victims Identified from Fiery UPS Cargo Plane Crash in Louisville","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic crash involving a UPS cargo plane during takeoff at the company’s Worldport hub in Louisville, 14 people died.

Thomas Massie voted and Greg Steube against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The SNAP and WIC programs, which deliver food and nutrition services to tens of millions of Americans, as well as veterans services, would continue to be funded if the government were to shut down again over the next few months.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, most Democrats in Congress loudly protested the bill, which offers zero guarantee that Washington will act to extend expiring enhanced health care subsidies that help Americans pay down their premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson corralled almost all Republicans behind the bill, despite sharp complaints from some of his members over a contentious provision added by Senate Republicans that allowed senators to retroactively sue the Department of Justice for obtaining phone records during a Biden-era probe – potentially amounting to a major financial windfall for those lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson himself said he was blindsided by the language, and he said he didn’t know about it until the Senate had already passed the package.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked by it, I was angry about it,” the speaker said, though he added that he did not believe Senate Majority Leader John Thune added it in a nefarious manner. “I think it was a really bad look, and we’re going to fix it in the House.”\n \n\n   \n  To win over conservative holdouts, Johnson vowed that the House would take a future vote to strip that language — though it’s unclear if the Senate would take it up. Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas ultimately agreed not to amend the language in the current stopgap bill, since it would require the Senate to return to Washington to vote again and delay the end of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Conservatives like Roy had blasted that provision as “self-dealing,” since it would award senators $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their lawsuit is successful. The amendment appeared to benefit eight senators in particular who had been subpoenaed by the previous administration into investigations into Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, accused those eight senators of voting “to shove taxpayer dollars into their own pockets – $500,000 for each time their records were inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  The end of the government shutdown will usher in a frenetic few weeks of work for the House, which has been largely shuttered since late September. As part of the GOP’s pressure campaign on Democrats, Johnson had decided to keep all members out of Washington until Senate Democrats agreed to back the GOP’s existing funding plan.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Republicans and Democrats have just four weeks in session before the end of the year — when those Obamacare tax credits expire. But there are plenty of other deadlines, including Congress’ farm bill and a slew of expiring energy credits.\n \n\n   \n  House Republicans are also eager to pass as many spending bills as possible to improve their negotiating stance with the Senate ahead of that next deadline on January 30.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson also faces another hot-button issue: the question of how Congress should handle the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  Not long before the votes to reopen the government got underway, a newly elected Democrat — Rep. Adelita Grijalva — became the critical 218th signature to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release all of its case files related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson announced to reporters soon after Grijalva signed the petition that he will put a bill compelling the Department of Justice to release all of its Epstein case files on the House floor next week – earlier than expected, and after an extraordinary White House pressure campaign earlier Wednesday failed to convince any Republicans to remove their name from the petition.\n \n\n   \n  The effort coincided with intensifying scrutiny over the Epstein files in the House. Earlier Wednesday, House Democrats on the Oversight panel released  new emails that  showed Epstein had repeatedly mentioned Trump by name in private correspondence, and then the GOP-led committee released 200,000 pages of documents the panel received from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-administration-meeting-house-effort-epstein-document-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00Z","title":"Exclusive: Trump administration holds Situation Room meeting over House effort to force release of all of DOJ’s Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration held a Situation Room meeting with key Republican lawmakers, including Rep.

Lauren Boebert.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that show the level of transparency when we are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns?” she told reporters at the press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt added: “I’m not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar confirmed the meeting in the Situation Room included Boebert, who has wanted the Justice Department to release its trove of Epstein files and has signed onto the effort in the House to force the vote compelling their release.\n \n\n   \n  That effort is now in motion after a newly sworn-in Democratic member of Congress provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  After the meeting, Boebert wrote on X, “I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  She later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, President Donald Trump and Rep. Nancy Mace, another Republican who’s signed the petition, had been playing phone tag for the past 24 hours. The South Carolina Republican sent a direct message to the president Wednesday outlining why she’s supporting the discharge petition, according to a source familiar with the message who said it largely mirrored a public statement in which she said: “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”\n \n\n   \n  But both the meeting and Trump’s efforts to talk to Mace underscored the administration’s concerns around the Epstein saga, which roared back Wednesday morning when the House Oversight Committee released more documents it had obtained from Epstein’s estate. (Leavitt said Wednesday the emails from that trove that mention Trump  “prove absolutely nothing.” )\n \n\n   \n  Besides Boebert and Mace, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is the other Republican who’s signed onto the petition from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, to force the vote on the release of the files on the House floor. The pair received the 218th decisive signature from Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva Wednesday afternoon,  allowing the push to force a vote to move forward. \n \n\n   \n  Had anyone removed their name from the petition before reaching 218, Massie and Khanna would have no longer had the support needed to move forward.\n \n\n   \n  Under the arcane procedure of a House discharge petition, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign on, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  The unreleased Justice Department files, which capture years of investigation into child sex trafficking, could include details the House hasn’t obtained.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the White House meeting, one source said it would also include Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi was seen leaving the White House at 1:10pm ET on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The controversy around Epstein and his contacts with other powerful people, including Trump, has divided the Republican Party in recent months, with Boebert being among the Republican House members publicly pushing for more transparency around the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any crime, and longtime Epstein contact and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell previously told Blanche in an interview this summer that she had seen no wrongdoing,  including by Trump.  \n \n\n   \n  At least two women who say they are survivors of Epstein’s abuse were expected to attend Grijalva’s swearing-in ceremony Wednesday afternoon, sources with knowledge told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The House effort to compel the release of the files, should it pass, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by Trump, who has derided the effort.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/chicago-ice-arrests-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-05:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Illinois Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of 615 individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a sweeping immigration crackdown by ICE agents in the Chicago area from June to October 2025.

the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to CNN affiliate  WLS , dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, 615 of those arrested must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling, which applies to people who do not have mandatory detention orders and do not pose a significant threat.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, Fleming told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented individuals – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week ruling her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE is expected to continue operations in Chicago. “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” McLaughlin previously told CNN in a statement following  reports  Bovino planned to leave the city soon. McLaughlin cited a drop in street crime since “Operation Midway Blitz” began.\n \n\n   \n  News that Bovino could leave Chicago came shortly after he was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/takeaways-epstein-emails-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:58:00-05:00","title":"Takeaways from the new Epstein emails mentioning Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, released by the House Oversight Committee, include references to Donald Trump, raising questions about his awareness of Epstein's activities.

Those emails came amid another huge release from the GOP-led committee of Epstein documents that  CNN is still reviewing .\n \n\n   \n  In one 2011 email, Epstein describes Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” He writes that someone who Democrats identify as an Epstein victim (but whose name is redacted in the released email) “spent hours at my house with him,” apparently referring to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans on the committee have since said the redacted victim who supposedly spent time with Trump  is Virginia Giuffre , one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. (Giuffre never implicated Trump in any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2019 email, Epstein appears to reflect on Trump asking Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to stop recruiting employees from Mar-a-Lago. In the email, Epstein says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2015 email, Epstein writes to author Michael Wolff about how Trump might handle questions about his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  (You can  see the emails for yourself here .)\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The White House on Wednesday said the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But what do these emails add to our understanding of their past relationship? Let’s break it down.\n \n\n   \n    Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and when\n \n\n   \n  There have remained huge unanswered questions about  what Trump knew and when about Epstein’s proclivities . That’s especially given Trump’s explanations have often  proved evasive or false .\n \n\n   \n  The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had “selectively leaked” the emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.\n \n\n   \n  To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein  liked women “on the younger side.”  A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein “ going after younger girls ” at a 1992 “calendar girl” event. Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein’s “swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls” and joking that it was nice of Epstein to “ let the neighborhood kids use his pool .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a “creep” — but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees, including Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago — but he seemed to be  quite reluctant to go into detail .\n \n\n   \n  The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being  recruited for .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he didn’t “know really why” Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation — and was aware of Epstein’s taste for young females — that would seem to raise red flags.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal actions,” Giuffre’s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in  a statement  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre “spent hours” at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell’s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn’t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein’s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump’s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s clear from Giuffre’s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends. “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,” Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses “next to the resort” who needed babysitting for their kids.\n \n\n   \n    The emails undercut Maxwell’s attempts to distance Trump from Epstein\n \n\n   \n  The Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so  despite  her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.\n \n\n   \n  (Trump at the time hadn’t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn’t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn’t explained how this happened, months later.)\n \n\n   \n  And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president.  She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But the new emails call her claims into question.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of Trump’s and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: “I don’t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of — I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.”\n \n\n   \n  But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein’s house, at least as of 2011.\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending “hours at my house” with Trump, Maxwell responds, “I have been thinking about that.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been  called into question .\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significant\n \n\n   \n  We surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There’s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  The timelines are important here.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein’s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently  stripped of his noble title .) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein  seemed to be going into legal attack mode .\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein’s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, Epstein described Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” This is an expression that comes from   Sherlock Holmes mysteries ; it basically means the absence of an expected event.\n \n\n   \n  Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected  news about Trump to have come out?\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of the 2019 email is also relevant. That’s because it came during Trump’s first term   as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump’s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ’s inspector general  said on January 30  of that year that he didn’t have the power to examine the situation. But  by February 6  the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors  as of early that year .\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump “of course” being aware of Maxwell’s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategize about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)\n \n\n   \n  In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to “let him hang himself” by denying being on Epstein’s plane or his house.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I know how dirty Donald is’: Several suggestions about what Epstein knew about Trump\n \n\n   \n  The newly released documents don’t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump’s possible impeachment: “you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.” (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about “the stories you could tell,” according to one of the released email exchanges. After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was “a phony rich person.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos “of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  He also told the person that he at one point “gave” his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.\n \n\n   \n  At other points in Epstein’s correspondence, Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,” Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. “Interested?”\n \n\n   \n    Trump is still feeding perceptions of a cover-up\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s reactions to the new documents Wednesday aren’t going to do anything to tamp down perceptions that Trump is trying to keep stuff like this hidden.\n \n\n   \n  CNN exclusively  reported  that the White House held a Situation Room meeting Wednesday with a key GOP lawmaker who’s signed onto an effort to force a House vote on releasing the full Epstein files, using what’s known as a  discharge petition  – something the White House wants to stop.\n \n\n   \n  That petition got a decisive 218th signature Wednesday from a new Democratic member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP lawmaker, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, later thanked White House officials for meeting with her in a post on X, writing, “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is also reporting Trump has  played phone tag  with another of the four Republican signatories, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. (She later said in a statement, “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”)\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s response to Oversight Democrats releasing emails that mention him was to publicly pressure Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap” on Epstein, Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else …”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional takeaways.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-trump-emails-oversight-committee","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:29:00-05:00","title":"Epstein Mentioned Trump Multiple Times in Private Emails, New Release Shows","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly released private emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee through a subpoena, reveal that Epstein mentioned Donald Trump multiple times, asserting that Trump spent time at his house and knew about the sex trafficking activities involving women, including Virginia Giuffre.

    \nUpdated: \n        6:29 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence that began almost 15 years ago with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit, according to newly released emails from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  The emails to longtime Epstein associate  Ghislaine Maxwell , who was convicted of sex trafficking after Epstein’s death, and the author Michael Wolff include conversations in which Epstein asserts Trump spent significant time with a woman whom Oversight Democrats describe as a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking. The emails also include a message in which Epstein asserts Trump “knew about the girls” — seemingly in reference to Trump’s  claim that he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club  for poaching young women who worked there, according to the newly released emails.\n \n\n   \n  The emails were released Wednesday morning by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which obtained them after  subpoenaing Epstein’s estate earlier this year , hours before the GOP-led panel released thousands more documents from the estate. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predated his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and the White House on Wednesday cast the issue as a “hoax” with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, Giuffre writes that her father, who was maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, got her a job as a locker room attendant. She wrote: “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. ‘Do you like kids?’ he asked. ‘Do you babysit at all?’ He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends, many of whom had children who needed tending.”\n \n\n   \n  She does not accuse Trump of wrongdoing in the book, “Nobody’s Girl.”\n \n\n   \n  About three years before the email – in June 2008 – Epstein had been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison after pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was released from prison in July 2009, having served just 13 months. Years later, his plea deal would face media scrutiny, including from the Miami Herald, and face widespread  criticism as being too lenient .\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in  an interview earlier this year  that she “never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings.\n \n\n   \n  “The President was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny amid a political firestorm in Washington over whether and when the federal government will release its files on the late sex trafficker who  died in prison in 2019 . The  controversy heated up earlier this year  when Trump’s own Justice Department declared that it  stood by its previous conclusion that Epstein died by suicide  and that it did not plan to provide any more information on the case.\n \n\n   \n  That sparked an outcry in Congress and among  some members of Trump’s own MAGA base , and it breathed life into efforts to pry loose new information. The House Oversight Committee successfully sought materials from the estate, and there is a separate effort underway in Congress to force a vote on compelling the release of more files from the US government. That effort received a critical, 218th supporter when  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  signed the discharge petition after being sworn in Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Wednesday criticized Democrats on the House Oversight Committee for releasing the messages, claiming the members “selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump’s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump echoed those criticisms in a series of Truth Social posts Wednesday afternoon, accusing of Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” and issuing a warning to Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” he added, as several GOP lawmakers have signed onto the House push to force a vote compelling the release of the Justice Department’s files related to Epstein. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term and about seven months before Epstein died by suicide in prison.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In her interview with Blanche, Maxwell denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the US president has denied any wrongdoing. He  filed a libel lawsuit  against the publisher of the Wall Street Journal and reporters who wrote  a story  about a  collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003 , including a note bearing Trump’s name and an outline of a naked woman.\n \n\n   \n  In a third email released by the Oversight committee and viewed by CNN Wednesday, Wolff — who published a book on Trump’s West Wing in 2018 — wrote Epstein with the subject line “heads up” on December 15, 2015. That was the day of a CNN Republican primary debate, but there is no mention of Epstein in the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you–either on air or in scrum afterwards,” Wolff reportedly wrote to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein, according to the email, responded, “if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff answered, “I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolff has indicated publicly that he has interviewed Epstein, and The Daily Beast has reported it obtained recordings in which Epstein spoke at length to the author about Trump and claimed the two were close friends. Trump’s camp has called the recordings “false smears,” according to  the Daily Beast .\n \n\n   \n  Following the House Oversight Democrats’ release of the emails with Wolff and Maxwell, the GOP-led panel released an additional 20,000 pages it had received from Epstein’s estate, including messages where Epstein criticized his onetime friend after Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald is f**king crazy,” Epstein wrote in one January 2017 email to a New York Times reporter, one week after Trump’s inauguration. In another December 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, he called the president “borderline insane.” That same month he emailed former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior.\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power,” he wrote. “tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler, who did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, and Epstein were corresponding at the time. But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melissa-hortman-death-vance-boelter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00-05:00","title":"Prosecutors turn over 130,000 pages of evidence in the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major federal case, prosecutors have handed over over 130,000 pages of documents, more than 800 hours of audio and video, and over 2,000 photographs to the defense in the killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as state Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette.

       7:06 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling  Thursday limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Thursday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/uk/british-police-maga-influencer-incident-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"British Police Want to Speak to a MAGA Influencer and Partner After London Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British police have issued a public appeal for information regarding a racially aggravated incident that occurred on October 11, 2025, at Bond Street Tube Station in central London.

Adelita Grijalva was  sworn in as the newest member of the House  after a weeks-long delay.\n \n\n   \n  The swearing in came ahead of a critical vote in the chamber to pass a Senate-approved bill to reopen the federal government and put an end to the longest shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats still vacant. Speaker Mike Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote.\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona Democrat’s swearing will pave the way for a highly anticipated vote to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Grijalva is expected to deliver the decisive signature on a petition from GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to force  a House vote  on the release of files related to the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had refused to call the House back into session or swear in Grijalva for weeks amid the government shutdown following her special election win at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker had indicated he would call the House back into session and swear in Grijalva once the Senate passed a bill to reopen the government – which they did earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  One of the vacant House seats, in Tennessee, leans Republican and will be filled by a special election next month. The other vacancy is in Texas where two Democrats have advanced to a runoff. That has not been yet scheduled but will be held early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/state-department-warning-japan-bears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:22:00Z","title":"US State Department warns Americans in Japan: Watch out for bears","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US State Department issued a rare wildlife alert to American citizens in northern Japan, warning of increased bear sightings and attacks—especially in Hokkaido and Akita prefectures—where at least 13 people have died and over 100 have been injured since April 2025.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US State Department on Wednesday  issued an unusual warning  to Americans in northern Japan: watch out for bears.\n \n\n   \n  The “wildlife alert” advised that “bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.”\n \n\n   \n  As  CNN reported last week , there has been a sharp uptick in bear attacks in Japan this year. At least 13 people have been killed and more than 100 injured since April this year, according to government figures – some of the highest numbers since records began in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  In the alert issued Wednesday, the US diplomatic mission in Japan noted that a park in Sapporo, which is located next to the US consulate, had been closed for two weeks following a bear sighting.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings,” the alert said. “Bears have also been spotted in other residential areas in Hokkaido and Akita prefectures.”\n \n\n   \n  “Authorities will generally close areas like parks if a bear has been sighted in the area,” it said, advising Americans not to walk alone in areas where bears have been seen.\n \n\n   \n  In Akita, local authorities have sought the help of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in combating the wild threat. Officials there said interventions like box traps and bear repellent sprays were not enough.\n \n\n   \n  Military forces are not allowed to kill the bears — only licensed hunters and local hunting associations are permitted to do so. Instead, the troops will provide logistical support, like setting up traps and transporting carcasses shot by hunters.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department rarely issues warnings to Americans about possible wildlife attacks. Instead, most alerts advise US citizens of potential security threats or natural disasters.\n \n\n   \n  The travel advisory level for Japan remains at the lowest level — Level 1: exercise normal precautions.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jessie Yeung and Junko Ogura contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:59:00-05:00","title":"The last-ever penny was minted today in Philadelphia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Mint officially ceased production of the penny on November 12, 2025, after 238 years, following a directive from President Donald Trump in February 2025.

It was 238 years old.\n \n\n   \n  The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia, overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach .  President Donald Trump announced via social media in February that he instructed the Mint to  stop making  the once-popular coin, citing the cost of production.\n \n\n   \n  The penny  costs nearly four cents  to mint, more than the coin’s worth. Once valuable enough to buy “penny candy” like gumballs and feed parking meters or toll booths, today the penny lives mostly in coin jars, junk drawers or “leave a penny/take a penny” trays.\n \n\n   \n  Beach said Wednesday that the final coins pressed will be auctioned off and that the actual last pennies put into circulation from the US Mint were struck in June.   \n \n\n   \n  The penny outlived its sibling, the half-penny, by 168 years. It’s survived by the nickel, dime, quarter, and rarely seen half-dollar and dollar coins.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its demise, the penny will remain  legal tender .\n \n\n   \n    Problems despite long planned end\n \n\n   \n  For a coin that seems obsolete, its removal from circulation is causing more problems than expected, especially for retailers.\n \n\n   \n  Some merchants plan to round prices to the nearest nickel, often a penny or two more. Others are asking customers to pay with pennies to help supply. But in some states, merchants could face legal trouble for rounding up or down.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, any savings from discontinuing the one-cent coin could be offset by the need to press more nickels, which costs the US Mint  more money  than the penny.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s phasing out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic,” said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, the company that provides the blanks used to make pennies. “By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”\n \n\n   \n  Weller said other countries that removed low denomination coins, like Canada, Australia and Switzerland, had guidance for afterwards. Not so in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said, referring to the president’s February announcement.\n \n\n   \n    Different rounding plans\n \n\n   \n  Kwik Trip, a family-owned convenience store chain that operates in the Midwest, decided to round down cash purchases in stores where it hasn’t been able to find pennies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” said John McHugh, spokesperson for the company. “I mean, it’s not their fault that there there’s a penny shortage.”\n \n\n   \n  But with 20 million customers a year, and 17% of them paying with cash, the policy will eventually cost Kwik Trip a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just businesses that face increased costs. Rounding to the closest nickel will cost consumers about $6 million a year, according to a July study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is fairly modest, coming to about five cents each across 133 million American households.\n \n\n   \n  And rounding is not a national solution.\n \n\n   \n  Four states - Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon - as well as numerous cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington, DC, require merchants to provide exact change, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the law covering the federal food assistance program known as SNAP requires that recipients not be charged more than other customers. Since SNAP recipients use a debit card that’s charged the precise amount, if merchants round down prices for cash purchases, they could be opening themselves to legal problems and fines, said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for NACS.\n \n\n   \n  “Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” Lenard said. “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, NACS and other retail groups recently wrote to Congress asking for legislation to deal with the questions raised by the end of penny production.\n \n\n   \n    End of a ‘wonderful life’\n \n\n   \n  The penny was one of the nation’s first coins, first minted in 1787, six years before the Mint itself was established.\n \n\n   \n  Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with designing the first penny known as the Fugio cent. Its current form arrived in 1909 on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, when it became the first American coin to feature a president.\n \n\n   \n  But it has declined in both use and popularity ever since. The Treasury Department now says there are  an estimated 300 billion pennies  in circulation. That comes to a bit less than $9 for every American. But most of those coins are “severely underutilized.” So, outcry from the public over its demise has been muted.\n \n\n   \n  Joe Ditler, a 74-year old writer and historian from Colorado, said he still has an old cigar box filled with mostly pennies given to him by his grandfather. He remembers flattening pennies on railroad tracks or souvenir machines in amusement parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he only occasionally uses pennies to make a cash purchase. And he often tosses the one-cent coin in the tip jar.\n \n\n   \n  “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said. “The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”\n \n\n   \n   -CNN’s Danny Freeman contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/travel/thanksgiving-travel-government-shutdown-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:30:00Z","title":"What’s happening with Thanksgiving flights?

happening with Thanksgiving flights? Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:30 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or two  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions after the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, flights have been cut and some air traffic controllers have not shown up for work.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy  suggested on Tuesday  during remarks at Central Wisconsin Airport that flight reductions might not end immediately after a deal to end the shutdown is reached, but that flights  could normalize  by Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  “So it depends on, are we going to have air traffic controllers come into work?” Duffy said. “If we have the controllers showing up, I think we’re going to be back to, you know, regular flight schedules again.”\n \n\n   \n  A  vote in the House  Wednesday could bring the government a big step closer to reopening.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC Wednesday morning that airlines will be “OK” for Thanksgiving. He’s the first airline leader to suggest publicly that carriers could be back to normal in time for the holidays after air traffic control staffing issues triggered lengthy delays across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “The bookings look good, and we’ll be back this weekend, as I said, pending the vote,” Bastian said. “Thanksgiving will be fine.”\n \n\n   \n  Ramping flights back up to pre-shutdown levels is a process.\n \n\n   \n  “We are preparing for record Thanksgiving travel, with some 31 million passengers expected, and the busy shipping season is coming up,” said Chris Sununu, president and CEO of the commercial airline industry trade   group Airlines for America, in a statement. “However, airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days.”\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week if the government reopens quickly. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown has dragged on, more controllers who have not been getting paid have not shown up for work, triggering the FAA’s  emergency order  to incrementally reduce flights at 40 US airports. On Thursday, flights are expected to be reduced by 8% at each airport and 10% on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu said Airlines for America has “not directly” heard from the FAA whether airlines can stop canceling flights ahead of the anticipated end of the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said this week that the FAA will not lift restrictions until it is safe to do so and controllers have returned to work.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  “For travelers looking to buy insurance for an upcoming trip, the government shutdown will be excluded from standard trip cancellation and interruption coverage, as it is now considered a known event,” Valdez said earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone.

the sun triggered auroras. Another round is on its way \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:12 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dazzling auroras delighted sky-gazers  Tuesday night , even in southern US states such as Florida where they rarely make an appearance — and more colorful displays are expected again Wednesday as solar storms unleashed by the sun continue to reach Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Strong geomagnetic storm conditions — triggered by intense solar flares — are ongoing, the National Weather Service’s  Space Weather Prediction Center  has reported. Currently classified as G3 on a scale from 1 to 5 to indicate severity, the event could reach severe, or G4, conditions with a chance of more extreme solar weather, according to the center. There is a chance that auroras will be visible as far south as Northern California and Alabama, according to the center.\n \n\n   \n  A G4 is also predicted for Thursday, and the northern tier of the US could see auroras tomorrow evening as well, said Shawn Dahl, forecaster at the center.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to creating auroral displays, geomagnetic storms can disrupt   communications, the power grid and satellite operations. The Space Weather Prediction Center said it notified power grid and satellite operators in the US so they can prepare. Meanwhile, operators in the United Kingdom are closely monitoring solar activity as well in case of potential impacts.\n \n\n   \n  “Our data suggests that this event could be one of the biggest storms we’ve seen in 20 years,” said Dr. Gemma Richardson, hazard specialist at the  British Geological Survey .\n \n\n   \n  The British Geological Survey believes the current solar activity could lead to a G5, or an extreme geomagnetic storm — the highest level. The survey also dubbed Tuesday’s event a “cannibal storm” that disrupted communications and GPS satellite accuracy.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, two Coronal Mass Ejections lifted off the sun a few hours apart,” the survey’s geomagnetism team explained in an email. “The first one was moving more slowly than the second  …  and so the second one caught up with the first one and they amalgamated together by the time they reached Earth. Hence, the term ‘cannibalised’, as the second one gobbled up the first one.”\n \n\n   \n    Solar storm disruptions\n \n\n   \n  Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in geomagnetic storms.\n \n\n   \n  Among those feeling the storm’s effects is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The company was  expected to launch  NASA’s  Escapade mission  — twin satellites   set to head on a long journey to Mars — aboard its New Glenn rocket Wednesday. But the increased solar activity is blocking a launch attempt for now.\n \n\n   \n  “NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch,” according to a  post by Blue Origin  on social media platform   X.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of activity around our sun   is sparking the storms. Three X-class flares, the most intense type of solar flare, have released from the sun this week, followed by a series of coronal mass ejections.\n \n\n   \n  The recent surge in activity stems from an active region of sunspots on the sun called AR 14274, according to Ryan French, a solar physicist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  “AR 14274 still has the potential to produce more X-class solar flares,” French said. “However, the region is now rotating away from us, so any eruptions from future flares are increasingly less likely to hit us as the days pass.”\n \n\n   \n  An X-class flare released Tuesday created a large solar particle storm, the largest since 2005, according to the British Geological Survey. Tuesday’s solar activity also created the largest measured geoelectric field since the survey’s records began in 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field can reach the ground, which triggers electricity in rocks and essentially creates an electric field in the ground. “This is usually tiny on the order of 0.001 Volt per kilometer but during geomagnetic storms it can be much larger,” the survey team noted.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, experts documented a value of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, an unusually large number that “has not been recorded before,” according to the geological survey’s team.\n \n\n   \n  Large geoelectric fields can interfere with transformers and may even cause them to shut down or overheat.\n \n\n   \n    A changing solar cycle\n \n\n   \n  The sun has an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity. Heliophysicists believe the peak, called  solar maximum , occurred in October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we are still in a period of heightened solar activity, we are entering the decay phase of the solar cycle,” French said.   “(Although) sunspots and solar flares are fewer during this time, this is the period where the strongest solar flares typically occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters at the Space Weather Prediction Center believe that the arrivals of the first two of three anticipated coronal mass ejections caused   Tuesday evening’s auroral display.\n \n\n   \n  “One of them packed a much stronger punch than we would have imagined originally,” Dahl said.\n \n\n   \n  When the storms reach satellites stationed 1 million miles from Earth, forecasters can measure its speed, the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic orientation, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it pointed opposite Earth, or is it pointed the same as Earth?” Dahl said. “If it turns opposite Earth, then activity really quickly escalates, and those storm levels can dramatically increase very quickly. That’s what happened last night.”\n \n\n   \n  The third solar storm arrived at Earth Wednesday afternoon, and is likely to trigger more aurora activity across the country this evening.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen the final (coronal mass ejection) arrive and are now waiting to see just how much magnetic energy exists within,” forecasters at the center shared in an update . \n \n\n   \n  Even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up.\n \n\n   \n  For those in areas   with clear dark skies, keep an eye out for auroras, which could dip far south over the US again. In the UK, sky-gazers in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland have a good chance of seeing them as well, according to the survey.\n \n\n   \n  The last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in  May 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  The storm was a historic one, but fortunately it didn’t reach the level of the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire and remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded.\n \n\n   \n  During the May 2024 geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.\n \n\n   \n  Before May 2024, the last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The recent outburst of activity reminds French of a severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth in  October 2024 . Tuesday night’s storm clocked in as third strongest solar storm of the current solar cycle, French said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"FDA and HHS Remove Black Box Warnings on Hormone Therapy for Menopause, Sparking Debate Over Evidence and Safety","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services have announced a major policy shift by removing most black box warnings from hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.

Critics argue that the FDA did not follow standard advisory processes, cited weak or misattributed evidence, and risks misleading patients and doctors into viewing hormone therapy as a universal cure.

Doctors are pushing for balance \n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to  remove the “black box” warning  on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.\n \n\n   \n  By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near  antibiotics and vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Makary blamed the broad   22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”\n \n\n   \n  “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.\n \n\n   \n  Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.\n \n\n   \n  They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a  comprehensive research review  published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.\n \n\n   \n  Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.\n \n\n   \n  After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”\n \n\n   \n    How the FDA pivoted\n \n\n   \n  In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.\n \n\n   \n  After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered   that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.\n \n\n   \n  Women stopped using hormones in droves.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.\n \n\n   \n  “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”\n \n\n   \n  Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.\n \n\n   \n  Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch  most of the black box warning  — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an  expert panel  discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to  a Viewpoint article  co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)\n \n\n   \n  “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.\n \n\n   \n  But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.”  The study  Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.\n \n\n   \n  Makary also didn’t mention   the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of   [hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.\n \n\n   \n  Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.\n \n\n   \n  The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”\n \n\n   \n  In the past, the agency has followed  a very different protocol  when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment   Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency  followed similar steps , including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”\n \n\n   \n    Looking for a more balanced approach\n \n\n   \n  In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.\n \n\n   \n  Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.\n \n\n   \n  Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.\n \n\n   \n  Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.\n \n\n   \n  This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.\n \n\n   \n  “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.\n \n\n   \n  Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.\n \n\n   \n  “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the evidence shows about hormones\n \n\n   \n  All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.\n \n\n   \n  “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”\n \n\n   \n  There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988.  One study  estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.\n \n\n   \n  But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.\n \n\n   \n  Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.\n \n\n   \n  “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”\n \n\n   \n  Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.\n \n\n   \n  Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”\n \n\n   \n  Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent viewpoint  published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.\n \n\n   \n  “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   \n  Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.\n \n\n   \n  She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.\n \n\n   \n  “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00Z","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities plan to deport at least 89 sick Palestinian patients, including children and elderly individuals, back to Gaza despite the fact that 94% of Gaza’s hospitals are damaged or destroyed and there is no functional healthcare system.

9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wolfe, Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focused on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska, and has led to the arrest of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard, on an unrelated charge.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard pleaded not guilty to a false imprisonment charge in court Wednesday and was ordered to be released with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 10 , the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Mother arrested on false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard faces a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She was being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/delhi-islamabad-blast-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:21:00Z","title":"Two blasts a day apart in India and Pakistan’s capitals fray regional nerves in an already tense year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two coordinated terrorist attacks—one in Delhi, India, and one in Islamabad, Pakistan—occurred within 24 hours in November 2025, marking a rare and severe escalation in regional security.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:21 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a bustling  Delhi  neighborhood, forensics teams combed through the charred skeleton of a car. Less than 24 hours later, the air outside  Islamabad’s  judicial complex was thick with the aftermath of a suicide bomb.\n \n\n   \n  The two deadly attacks are separate, and no evidence currently links the two. But for the two South Asian rivals, the political shockwave caused by the blasts are a stark reminder of the  lingering security issues  that fester below the surface throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  Explosions in their heavily fortified capitals are a rarity, and two in as many days have put officials in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan on edge, potentially  reigniting a cycle  of suspicion and blame after what has already been a tense year for all countries.\n \n\n   \n  A suicide bombing in Islamabad on Tuesday killed at least 12 people and injured 20 more, marking the deadliest such attack to strike the Pakistani capital in nearly two decades. It came just a day after a rare car explosion tore through a historic Delhi neighborhood, killing at least 10 and leaving more than a dozen wounded.\n \n\n   \n  The twin tragedies have handed political hardliners in both New Delhi and Islamabad a potent weapon, ratcheting up domestic pressure on each government to act decisively.\n \n\n   \n  The blame game ignited almost immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, without providing evidence, accused “Indian terrorist proxies” for the Islamabad attack, claiming it was “backed by India” from Afghan soil. New Delhi fired back, rejecting the “baseless and unfounded allegations” as “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the Delhi blast, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring “all those responsible… to justice.” On Wednesday, the Indian government  called  the explosion a “terrorist incident,” which was “perpetrated by anti-national forces.”\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi has not named Pakistan in connection with the explosion, and authorities have so far remained tight lipped as to who they believe might be responsible. But in past attacks, India has frequently  pointed the finger  at Islamabad, which is what makes this week’s twin attacks potentially fraught.\n \n\n   \n  “We are witnessing an increasingly fragile security environment across South Asia,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “South Asia cannot afford further confrontation; the region is being held together by fragile ceasefires with no long-term resolution. What’s needed now is restraint, reflection, and a commitment to reset the regional course toward stability.”\n \n\n   \n    Secure capitals\n \n\n   \n  While both India and Pakistan have historically faced significant security threats, their capitals are meant to be fortresses – home to the seats of government, military leadership, and the diplomatic corps.\n \n\n   \n  In Delhi, the attack struck near the iconic Red Fort, a landmark and tourist hub teeming with crowded bazaars and street vendors. It came hours after police found thousands of kilograms of explosives from a village in Faridabad, a city just outside New Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Faridabad police official confirmed to CNN that police are investigating whether the recovery of these explosives was linked to the Red Fort blast. Police in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been conducting a joint operation across these states, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Modi has  built his brand  on a muscular national security policy, casting himself as the nation’s “watchman” and opposition politicians immediately seized on the alleged security lapse.\n \n\n   \n  “If the country is not safe… if the people are not safe… Questions will be asked,” Supriya Shrinate, a national spokesperson for the Indian National Congress, told local news agency ANI. She criticized the prime minister for traveling to Bhutan a day after the attack. “People… are starting to feel that the country is not in strong hands,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Across the border in Islamabad, the explosion occurred in the parking lot of the judicial complex, an area situated within a district that is home to numerous high-ranking government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan experiences chronic instability at the hands of militants, but Islamabad rarely witnesses such attacks thanks to a heavy security presence with Tuesday’s explosion being the deadliest to strike the capital since 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been carrying a heavy burden and a great distress in my mind,” advocate Jaseem Ahmed Bhutto, who witnessed the attack, told Reuters. “It’s a sense of confusion and concern that if the courts, where every ordinary and prominent person goes and where cases are resolved, are not safe, then who is safe in this city?”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP) behind some of the country’s deadliest attacks over the past decade, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement seen by CNN. The TTP, however, distanced itself, according to its spokesman Mohammad Khursasani.\n \n\n   \n  The bombing prompted a furious response from the government. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif declared a “state of war” and described the attack as a “wake-up call” regarding Afghanistan – a reference to Pakistan’s allegation that militant safe havens on Afghan soil are the source of its problems.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in militant violence since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021, fueling cross-border tensions that recently erupted into the  worst clashes  the two countries have seen in years.   Recent talks  in Qatar and Istanbul aimed at ending the latest cross-border fighting in have made little progress.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban have denied backing the Pakistani Taliban and expressed “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding Tuesday’s attack in Islamabad.\n \n\n   \n  According to Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, this year “has been particularly bad” for Pakistan and Afghanistan, “not just in terms of the loss of life of Pakistani soldiers, but many officer ranked personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  This, he noted, is something “the political and military leadership in Pakistan has taken very seriously.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A moment of great volatility’\n \n\n   \n  The cycle of accusations and hyperbole following attacks in India and Pakistan is a well-documented political pattern. And while this rhetoric serves both government’s political needs, it also has the potential to push the countries into dangerous standoffs.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s attacks come “in a moment of great churn and volatility in South Asia,” according to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.\n \n\n   \n  With Pakistan blaming Taliban-backed militants it sees as being   sponsored by India, the situation could escalate, he said. “We’re looking at a potential crisis that could engulf not two but three countries of South Asia: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India,” Kugelman added.\n \n\n   \n  This blame game is fueled by deep-seated narratives on both sides.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Pakistan has accused India of sponsoring terrorism on its soil, claiming that Indian intelligence uses Afghanistan as a base to support anti-Pakistan militants like the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, India has long accused Pakistan of supporting and harboring militants that carry out attacks. Both sides deny each other’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s blaming of India for Tuesday’s suicide attack comes just months after the two nuclear-armed rivals engaged in their most intense fighting in decades: a  four-day conflict  in May featuring clashes with fighter jets, missiles, and drones.\n \n\n   \n  That deadly conflict was  triggered by a massacre  at a scenic mountain spot in India-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Following a familiar script, India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied. Modi  redefined  India’s policy on terrorism in the aftermath, which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered “an act of war.” New Delhi launched airstrikes against its neighbor, which prompted a swift military retaliation from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  According to Humayun, many in Pakistan might have been watching the aftermath of the Delhi blast with “bated breath,” anxious to see if the familiar finger-pointing from India would begin. He highlighted the initial “restraint on the Indian side” as a departure from that script.\n \n\n   \n  But if the Indian government suggests the blast was a terrorist attack, “the public will likely expect something big in response from the Indian government,” Kugelman said. “That said, I don’t think there will be as much pressure on New Delhi.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s principal counter-terrorism body, the National Investigation Agency, has taken over the probe.\n \n\n   \n  As governments separately attempt to get to the bottom of both attacks, the citizens of Delhi and Islamabad are left cleaning up the debris and mourning their dead.\n \n\n   \n  Both capitals had, for years, been largely “insulated from these kinds of incidents,” Humayun said.\n \n\n   \n  That they can now occur in these cities suggest that this type of vulnerability “is no longer just a symptom of the hinterland. It’s coming to major metropolises.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-domestic-talent-jobs-h1b-visas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00.000Z","title":"Trump Says U.S. Doesn’t Have People with ‘Certain Talents’ to Fill Jobs Domestically","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the U.S. H-1B skilled worker visa program, arguing that the country lacks workers with 'certain talents' to fill essential domestic jobs, citing the September 2025 ICE raid on a Georgia Hyundai battery plant where South Korean contractors were deported.

It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments come just two weeks after he told reporters traveling with him to South Korea that he was   “very much opposed” to the raid  carried out by federal officers as part of his administration’s immigration crackdown at US worksites.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signed an executive action in September to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas.

Gavin Newsom pulled no punches at the COP30 climate talks in Brazil on Tuesday, calling President Donald Trump an “invasive species” and a “wrecking ball” during discussions about the US  absence from global climate action .\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, a Democrat widely viewed as a likely presidential candidate in 2028, is the most high-profile US political figure attending the talks in the Amazon city of Belém. The Trump administration made the unprecedented decision not to send a high-level delegation to the annual talks — the latest move in its sharp pull away from global climate action.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has spent the past year tearing up climate policies, seeking to  strangle clean energy projects , pushing other countries to buy US oil and gas and  withdrawing the US  from the Paris climate agreement. In a speech at the United Nations in September, Trump called climate change a “con job.”   \n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has a history of sparring with Trump, appears to be using COP30 as an opportunity to set out a different vision for US climate action. “I do not want the United States of America to be a footnote on climate policy,” he said at an event Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  He took sharp, personal aim at Trump for abandoning efforts to tackle the climate crisis. “He’s an invasive species. He is. He’s a wrecking ball president. And he’s trying to roll back progress of the last century … he’s doubling down on stupid,” Newsom   said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s stance is handing victory to China, he added. China is dominating clean energy supply chains and manufacturing “because they understand the great economic opportunity,” Newsom said.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom was also asked about the Trump administration’s reported plan to open the California coast to oil and gas drilling, as  reported  in The Washington Post yesterday based on a leaked draft map.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never going to happen. Over our dead body. Dead on arrival. Period. Full stop,” Newsom said. He asked the audience to consider why Trump might be targeting California. “He has no interest in opening up oil drilling rigs right off the coast of Florida, across the street from Mar-a-Lago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House shot back with its own fiery reply to Newsom’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, sent this in response to a request for comment: “Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing! If Gavin Newscum’s﻿   support for the climate agenda was sincere, he would not be attending a climate summit that required chopping down thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest for a special purpose highway.

oust Keir Starmer as the embattled British leader denies attacking his rivals \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:29 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was forced Wednesday to address reports that rivals in his Labour Party are plotting to replace him as leader, just two weeks ahead of a government budget announcement that could worsen his  already dire poll ratings .\n \n\n   \n  Several British news outlets quoted Starmer allies late Tuesday saying his job might be under immediate threat and singling out Wes Streeting, the health secretary, as a challenger whose “ambition” was being viewed with “particular suspicion.” Those same allies briefed that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Streeting dismissed the reports as “self-defeating nonsense,” telling British media that he could “not see any circumstances under which I would do that to our prime minister.” He accused those responsible for the briefings – the claims circulated to the press – of trying to “kneecap” him.\n \n\n   \n  By Wednesday afternoon, what might have remained as trivial political gossip had snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of presiding over a “toxic” culture in Downing Street, Starmer was forced to address the reports that his allies were briefing against senior members of his government.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer told Parliament that he had not authorized the negative briefings against his colleagues. “I appointed them to their posts because they’re the best people to carry out their jobs,” he said. “Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest crisis to hit the government comes ahead of a budget announcement on November 26, when Labour – in order to fill a fiscal black hole – is expected to break a key election pledge by increasing the basic rate of income tax for the first time in half a century.\n \n\n   \n  Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that both tax rises and spending cuts are possible when she lays out her plans for the year ahead, seeking to cut government debt. That would likely spur further attacks from Nigel Farage, whose upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party has led Labour in national polls for months.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer’s popularity went into freefall soon after Labour won a landslide general election victory in July 2024. YouGov, a pollster, said this month that just 17% of Britons approve of the job Starmer is doing as prime minister, while 73% disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  The decision by Starmer’s allies to brief against Streeting, the minister tasked with repairing Britain’s depleted National Health Service, bewildered and blindsided many Labour Party politicians and has raised questions about the prime minister’s control of his governing operation in Downing Street.\n \n\n   \n  “People are flummoxed,” one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. “Nobody quite understands where this briefing is coming from.”\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers are also perplexed by the timing of the briefing. After an unsteady first 16 months in office left Starmer one of the most unpopular British prime ministers on record, Labour MPs had previously signaled that the prime minister would not face a serious leadership contest until after local elections in May 2026, giving his government time to reverse its decline in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the Tuesday night briefing raised the possibility that Starmer could face a leadership challenge after the budget.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Streeting’s denial that he is seeking to challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, a “Wes for Leader” website was created on Tuesday. CNN has asked Streeting’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Rumors of a leadership challenge last swirled in September, when Andy Burnham – a former MP and the current mayor of Greater Manchester – launched an audacious and abortive attempt at challenging Starmer’s approach on the eve of Labour’s annual conference.\n \n\n   \n  Ousting a Labour leader is difficult, however, since any challenger would need the support of 20% of the party’s members of parliament, meaning 80 lawmakers would need to agree on an alternative candidate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/kazakhstan-lgbtq-propaganda-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-05:00","title":"Kazakhstan follows Russia in banning ‘LGBTQ propaganda’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kazakhstan’s lower parliament, the Mäjilis, has advanced a new anti-LGBTQ propaganda law that prohibits the dissemination of content promoting non-traditional sexual orientations or pedophilia in public, media, and online spaces, citing the need to protect children.

Here’s how to watch \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:14 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The 2025 Latin Grammy Awards are right around the corner, which means it is time to get those viewing party plans in action.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about watching the 2025 Latin Grammys, including how to stream and where you can see music’s biggest stars walking the red carpet.\n \n\n   \n    When do the Latin Grammys start and how can I watch?\n \n\n   \n  The 26th annual Latin Grammy Awards return to Las Vegas’ MGM Grand Garden Arena on Nov. 13. Last year’s ceremony was held in Miami, where the Latin Recording Academy is headquartered.\n \n\n   \n  The Latin Grammys will broadcast live on TelevisaUnivision’s US platforms – Univision, UNIMÁS, ViX and Galavisión – beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An hourlong pre-show will begin at 7 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Like the  Grammys , the majority of the Latin Grammys are handed out during the Latin Grammy Premiere ceremony, which precedes the telecast.\n \n\n   \n    Who is performing at the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n   Bad Bunny , CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso, Karol G, Marco Antonio Solís, Chuwi, Fuerza Regida and its singer Jesús Ortiz Paz will all perform.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s not all: Pepe Aguilar, Aitana, Ivan Cornejo, DannyLux, Gloria Estefan, Kakalo, Carín León, Liniker, Morat and Los Tigres del Norte will also hit the stage, as well as the Latin Grammy’s 2025 Person of the Year, Raphael.\n \n\n   \n    Who is hosting the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic duo of Maluma and actor, producer and musician Roselyn Sánchez will host. This marks Sánchez’s eighth time hosting the awards.\n \n\n   \n    What’s new at the 2025 Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  There is a new field in 2025, for visual media, and two new categories: music for visual media and roots song.\n \n\n   \n  The former will recognize original music for movies, TV shows, video games and other visual media. For a project to participate in this category, it must feature Latin rhythms or be composed by someone of Ibero American descent.\n \n\n   \n  The roots award will go to the songwriters of new, unpublished recordings that reflect the traditions and roots of various communities, cultures, or social groups, especially those of Hispanic American origin, whether in Spanish, Portuguese or Indigenous languages or dialects.\n \n\n   \n  The best urban/urban fusion performance category also has a new name, and its criteria has also changed. Now, remixes are eligible only if the original version of the song was released within the same eligibility year. The required percentage of urban elements has increased from 51% to 60% to qualify in this category.\n \n\n   \n    Who is nominated for the Latin Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  Who else but Bad Bunny leads the nominations with 12. He dethroned producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera – known for his work with Bad Bunny as well as Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira, Grupo Frontera and beyond – who previously topped the list in 2023 and 2024 with 13 and 9 nominations, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Don’t cry for him, though: Barrera is tied with Argentinian hip-hop duo CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso for the second most nominations. They have 10 each.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Bad Bunny, CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso are also nominated in the album of the year category, which is rounded out by Rauw Alejandro, Gloria Estefan, Vicente García, Joaquina, Natalia Lafourcade, Carín León, Liniker, Elena Rose and Alejandro Sanz.\n \n\n   \n  Both Bad Bunny and CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso are nominated twice in the record of the year category, which also features artists Lafourcade, Sanz, Jorge Drexler & Conociendo Rusia, Zoe Gotusso, Karol G and Liniker.\n \n\n   \n  The best new artist category nominees are Alleh, Annasofia, Yerai Cortés, Juliane Gamboa, Camila Guevara, Isadora, Alex Luna, Paloma Morphy, Sued Nunes and Ruzzi.\n \n\n   \n    What is the relationship between the Latin Grammys and the Grammys?\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud likened the Recording Academy – the governing body behind the Grammys – and the Latin Recording Academy to sister organizations.\n \n\n   \n  While the Grammys focus on the US market, he said the Latin Grammys have different global considerations. “Our voting process is, I would say, identical, but it has some adjustments for the international component that we have that they don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the relationship between the Grammys and the Latin Grammys will grow even closer in 2026. Last week, the Recording Academy announced that all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy as part of its 2025 new member class.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/trump-bbc-sue-one-billion-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00.000Z","title":"Trump Threatens to Sue BBC for $1 Billion Over Speech Editing Allegations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over allegations that a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' misrepresented his January 6, 2021 speech by splicing together two separate statements — one calling for cheering supporters and another calling for fighting like hell — to falsely imply a direct call for violent action.

\nUpdated: \n        11:17 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for  $1 billion  over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory”  edits  to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I think I have an obligation to do it … because you can’t allow people to do that,” Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. He said the BBC had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    What is the scandal about?\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK –  the Guardian praised  it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter  to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    How did the scandal originate?\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial position, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns   about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his  Substack . “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n \n\n   \n  Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor,  reported  Sunday   that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n \n\n   \n    Have heads rolled?\n \n\n   \n  Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n \n\n   \n  Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n    What is the BBC? Who owns it?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has expressed disbelief that “one of our great allies” could treat him so dishonestly. “(The) BBC – the government has a chunk of that one, I guess,” he said in Tuesday’s interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  The British government does not “have a chunk” of the BBC. The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter,” which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n \n\n   \n  It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n \n\n   \n  Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n \n\n   \n  More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n \n\n   \n    Is the BBC impartial?\n \n\n   \n  Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences. The broadcaster says it is committed to “achieving due impartiality” in all its output.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that, as with every news outlet, mistakes happen, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n  But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump threatened?\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n \n\n   \n  The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n \n\n   \n    Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n \n\n   \n  It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n \n\n   \n  Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the case being brought in Florida?\n \n\n   \n  In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n \n\n   \n  “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n \n\n   \n    Has Trump threatened media outlets before?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay  $15 million  in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay  $16 million  to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n \n\n   \n  Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/sport/tennis-atp-finals-taylor-fritz-ben-shelton","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00.000Z","title":"It’s time for the men to step up: Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton seek inspiration from US women","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, American women's tennis achieved its most successful season in nearly 25 years, with champions Madison Keys, Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, and Jessica Pegula achieving major wins.

\n  An American featured in all four singles grand slam finals, with  Amanda Anisimova  finishing runner-up at both Wimbledon and US Open finals.\n \n\n   \n  Statistically, it was the most successful season for American women on record in nearly a quarter of a century.\n \n\n   \n  The bold accomplishments and records by their compatriots are not lost on male counterparts  Taylor Fritz  and  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Inspired by the repeated achievements of the US women, the American duo – who compete at this week’s season-ending Nitto ATP Finals in Turin – stand ready to grasp the nettle and write their own piece of history.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not just this year that they’ve had really success, it’s pretty much every year for a long time,” Fritz tells CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “The women have been really carrying US tennis, so it is time for the men to step up.”\n \n\n   \n    Upwards trajectory\n \n\n   \n  And step up is what the US pair have done.\n \n\n   \n  After four American women – the aforementioned trio plus  Jessica Pegula  – competed in the WTA Finals in Riyadh earlier this month, the most since 2002, Fritz and Shelton have laid down their own marker.\n \n\n   \n  The 28- and 23-year-olds, respectively, became the first pair to represent the US in the singles at the men’s equivalent event for 19 years.\n \n\n   \n  You have to go all the way back to 2006 in Shanghai for the last time that happened, when major champion Andy Roddick and James Blake made up the eight-man field.\n \n\n   \n  That year, Blake made an impressive run to the title match before eventually losing out to Roger Federer.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to this year and Fritz returned to Turin for a third time, having been a semifinalist in 2022 and a runner-up last year, while Shelton is making his debut.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his loss to  Jannik Sinner  in the 2024 Final, for Fritz, it was the cherry on top of a career-best year that saw him reach the final at Flushing Meadows off the back of two grand slam quarterfinal appearances in Melbourne and Wimbledon.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt like my level at the end of the year was really good,” says the 6-foot-5-inch right-hander.\n \n\n   \n  “I proved a lot of things that gave me a lot of confidence that I’m really right there and also made it clear as well, the things that I need to improve on … moving forward to try to contend against the other top guys.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘This is where you want to be’\n \n\n   \n  While not scaling the same heights this year, Fritz has still added two trophies to his cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  For Shelton, 2025 has been a year of marked improvement, backed up by a maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto – his biggest tournament victory to date.\n \n\n   \n  All this having finished outside the world’s top 20 last year.\n \n\n   \n  And the rising Atlanta-born star is relishing the opportunity to compete with some of the biggest names on the biggest stage this week.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a big goal for me at the beginning of the year,” he says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that I had my work cut out and had a lot of improvements that I needed to make to be here at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is where you want to be, this is where you want to end your year … making the last push in a place like this with a lot on the line makes it pretty easy.”\n \n\n   \n  And an added incentive lies in both players knowing that whoever performs better on the blue indoor courts of Turin will end the year as the No. 1 American.\n \n\n   \n    Grand slam quest\n \n\n   \n  Shelton, though, is not content with just participating.\n \n\n   \n  He, like Fritz, wants to regularly compete for the biggest and best prizes in the sport.\n \n\n   \n  And that means winning majors.\n \n\n   \n  While in this day and age and on current form it seems hard, if not near enough impossible, for anyone to lay even a glove on the current irresistible force in the men’s game – that of Jannik Sinner and  Carlos Alcaraz  – the American is convinced the stranglehold can be broken.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold claim, considering he and Fritz have combined for just two wins in 22 official matches against the dominant duo.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon’s rationale? Depth, resilience and desire among the US contingent.\n \n\n   \n  “We have multiple guys at the top of the game and we want to be dominant as a country,” he says confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had our work cut out for us to catch up to the women who have been dominating … but we’re getting closer.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been over two decades now since the US last crowned a men’s grand slam singles champion. Only Fritz has come closest to ending the hex.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have a time frame. I’ve said a lot that’s for the media to speculate,” Shelton explains.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s too much talent right now for us not to break through at some point. The media will write article after article about the drought or who’s going to be the next or when is going to be the next.\n \n\n   \n  “I just know that it’s inevitable and I’m just excited to kind of be a part of that surge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Time will tell whether that prophecy comes to fruition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/oil-demand-2050-iea-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:12:00-05:00","title":"So long, peak oil: World demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its outlook to predict that global oil and natural gas demand will continue to grow until 2050, reversing earlier projections of a peak in oil demand this decade.

demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says \n       \n  By Reuters\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Global demand for oil and natural gas could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following US criticism of its climate focus.\n \n\n   \n  The IEA also predicted in its annual outlook that the world would likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris-based energy security watchdog has been under pressure from the United States for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, the IEA predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Peak oil’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called the IEA’s demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The agency is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor.\n \n\n   \n  In its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the IEA predicted that under a “current policies scenario” oil demand would hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario – which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition – is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals.\n \n\n   \n  IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario had been restored to reflect differing choices governments were making about energy.\n \n\n   \n  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope… we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In the IEA’s “stated policies scenario,” which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.\n \n\n   \n    LNG capacity to soar\n \n\n   \n  Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic meters of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and artificial intelligence growth.\n \n\n   \n  Global investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply.\n \n\n   \n  The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050.\n \n\n   \n  More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n \n\n   \n  But the report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-agents-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Gregory Bovino Planning to Leave Chicago Amid Legal Backlash and Public Criticism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top federal official leading immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, is planning to leave Chicago as early as this week to relocate operations to cities like Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans.

Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in cities, along with his agents, are planning to leave Chicago as early as this week as they eye other locations to ramp up arrests, according to three US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino  has become the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there — first in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his officers are expected to head to Charlotte, North Carolina, then continue to New Orleans, according to two of the officials, who stressed plans are still being finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office “has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began. CBS News first  reported  Bovino planned to leave Chicago soon.\n \n\n   \n    Potential move comes after personal rebuke from judge\n \n\n   \n  The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally  called out  by a federal judge.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, “unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.”\n \n\n   \n  That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is  appealing  the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be  delayed  while an appeals court panel considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were “violent rioters and assaultive subjects.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a “reportable use of force” because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. “In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    President has publicly discussed other cities for operations\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  While Bovino and his team’s relocation is not yet final, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the news Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Greg Bovino’s legacy in Chicago is chaos, criminality, and terror,” Johnson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the grassroots resistance to Bovino that has forced them to retreat,” the mayor added. “Bovino did nothing to make our city safer. He will not be missed in Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  “This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety — this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets,” said a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:31 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC board held an unexpected meeting on Wednesday as the British broadcaster stares down a l egal threat from President Trump , a source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The person, who had direct knowledge of the meeting, said the board is not planning to issue any immediate statement afterward. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s meeting is the latest sign of a scramble inside the BBC to address the fallout from last week’s Telegraph newspaper story about a  serious editing error  in a October 2024 documentary about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the president sent a demand letter to the BBC on Monday, one day after two top executives resigned amid the editing controversy.\n \n\n   \n  The letter claimed that Trump suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” due to the bad edit, even though the error did not garner attention at the time of the broadcast. The letter asserted that the entire documentary should be retracted and warned of a $1 billion lawsuit if Trump’s demands are not met.\n \n\n   \n  With dramatic flair, it assigned a Friday deadline and said “the BBC is on notice.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a lengthy history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances. And he has used both lawsuits and the threat of suits to win settlements and concessions from other parties.\n \n\n   \n  British media outlets have been consumed with stories about whether the BBC will try to appease Trump, or will stand up to him, like The Times and The Journal have. And BBC News staffers have been questioning whether the 13-member board is up to the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  The board has been widely criticized for responding too slowly to last week’s outcry about the editing screwup\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not clear that Trump has jurisdiction to sue,” media lawyer Mark Stephens told CNN’s Max Foster on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the $1 billion dollar amount is “totally meaningless,” Media Law Resource Center executive director George Freeman told a BBC reporter. Freeman reminded listeners that Trump “has a long record of unsuccessful libel suits.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has a successful recent track record of squeezing concessions out of vulnerable institutions – like Paramount, the parent of CBS News, which agreed to pay $16 million toward his future presidential library last summer.\n \n\n   \n  On the other hand, the appearance of capitulation has been costly for media brands like Disney, which lost subscribers when it briefly suspended Jimmy Kimmel’s show amid government pressure in September. Kimmel is now back on the air and ridiculing Trump again on a nightly basis.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment about the board meeting, a BBC spokesperson referred back to the corporation’s original statement about Trump’s legal threat: “We are reviewing the letter and will respond directly in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-video-tribute-cleto-escobedo-iii","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"08:49:00-05:00","title":"Jimmy Kimmel’s Tribute to Cleto Escobedo III, His Dear Friend and Bandleader","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jimmy Kimmel, the host of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!', delivered a deeply emotional tribute to his childhood friend and bandleader, Cleto Escobedo III, who died at age 59.

shared his broken heart for 22 minutes with his audience Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  The late night host used his “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” monologue to speak about his childhood friend who was also his bandleader. Cleto Escobedo III  died at the age of 59  on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been on the air for almost 23 years and I’ve had to do some hard monologues along the way, but this one’s the hardest, because late last night, early this morning, we lost someone very special who was much too young to go,” Kimmel said at the open of his show. “And I’d like to tell you about him if you wouldn’t mind.”\n \n\n   \n  He met Escobedo when they were children, after Kimmel’s family moved from Brooklyn to Las Vegas. Escobedo, who he called Junior, lived on his block.\n \n\n   \n  And “not just regular friends” Kimmel explained.\n \n\n   \n  “We became like 24-7, ‘Mom, please let me sleep over please’ kind of friends,” he said. “One summer I slept over at the Escobedo house 33 nights in a row.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair had all types of fun from shooting pool to boxing for hours in the backyard. They also shared a love of late night host David Letterman.\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel also hailed Escobedo for being a fabulous saxophone player and shared a clip of his friend performing with Paula Abdul.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s career included touring with big names, including Luis Miguel, Marc Anthony, and Philip Bailey from Earth, Wind and Fire. That all led to working with Kimmel after he landed his late night talk show in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course I wanted Cleto to lead my band,” Kimmel said. “We grew up watching Dave and Paul” — David Letterman and his bandleader Paul Shaffer — “and the idea that anyone other than leading the band was terrifying.”\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo brought his father into the band, which they named Cleto and the Cletones. The elder Escobedo was on hand at Tuesday’s show and the bandleader’s mom, Sylvia, was in the audience, as Kimmel said she often would be, saying a rosary.\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel helped break the news of his friend’s death, posting on social media “Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III.”\n \n\n   \n  “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old,”  Kimmel wrote.  “The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/katseye-death-threats-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"09:58:00-05:00","title":"KATSEYE Say They Receive Thousands of Death Threats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"KATSEYE, a globally diverse girl group formed through the Netflix docuseries 'Pop Star Academy,' has revealed they face frequent online death threats and intense public scrutiny.

Second-generation Indian-American Lara Raj, 20, admitted that online abuse takes a toll on the band, saying, “If a thousand people are sending you death threats … even if it’s not going to happen … it’s heavy, and it’s jarring.”\n \n\n   \n  The rest of KATSEYE nodded agreement, before the interviewer, Mark Savage, asked the women if they’d all received threats of this nature. Without hesitation, all six members of the group confirmed death threats were a common occurrence, chorusing “yes” and “so many.”\n \n\n   \n  Now a K-pop phenomenon, Raj and bandmates Daniela Avanzini, Manon Bannerman, Megan Skiendiel, Sophia Laforteza and Yoonchae Jeung all earned their place in KATSEYE after an arduous 12-week audition program, “The Debut: Dream Academy,” which was streamed on YouTube.\n \n\n   \n  Modeled on the K-pop artist development process and organized by K-pop entertainment leader HYBE and US label Geffen Records —   the partnership behind the US distribution and promotion of megastars BTS — the hopefuls completed missions requiring them to choreograph, rehearse and perform for hours a day.\n \n\n   \n  Netflix followed the 20 contestants from beginning to end, releasing a docuseries on its platform in August 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Laforteza, who is 22 and originally from the Philippine capital, Manila, told the BBC the training program was “very rigorous, very demanding,” adding that it “really equipped us for where we are now.”\n \n\n   \n  The band, which received Grammy nominations last week for best new artist and best group performance,   shared their concerns about the power of the internet.\n \n\n   \n  Laforteza and Raj said social media allows them to see how they are perceived by swathes of people from around the world, something none of the band believes to be safe; reading comments can be “terrorizing on the mind,” according to Bannerman.\n \n\n   \n  She described the “constant comparison between all of us,” before the other band members explained how they are often ranked online and pitted against one another in a points-based system they said considers factors including how pretty they are, how they sing and how they perform. “It’s so dystopian,” Raj said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, KATSEYE are undeterred. “We’ve all come from different places with different cultures and upbringings yet we’re able to come together and create magic through music,” Laforteza said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/listeria-food-safety-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00.000-05:00","title":"At least 27 people sickened and 6 dead in latest US listeria outbreak.

What you should know \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:56 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Six people have died due to a  multistate outbreak of listeria  linked to recalled prepared pasta meals sold at major grocery chains, including Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market and Trader Joe’s.\n \n\n   \n  The  warning by federal health officials  noted at least 27 reported cases of infection across 18 states, and health officials said that a pregnant woman lost her fetus after becoming ill.\n \n\n   \n  I wanted to know more about listeria contamination and why it’s dangerous. What symptoms should people watch for, and how is the infection diagnosed and treated? Who is most at risk for severe illness, and what foods are most often linked to outbreaks like this one? And as we head into the holiday season, what can people do to reduce their chances of getting sick from foodborne bacteria?\n \n\n   \n  To help me with these questions, I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What is listeria, and why is it dangerous? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria found in soil, water and certain foods that can cause a serious infection known as  listeriosis . Unlike many other foodborne pathogens, listeria can grow at refrigerator temperatures, which means it can survive and multiply in foods that are already cooked or stored cold. It most often contaminates ready-to-eat foods such as deli meats, soft cheeses, smoked fish, unpasteurized dairy products and refrigerated prepared meals.\n \n\n   \n  For  most healthy adults , a mild infection may cause only brief flu-like symptoms, but for certain people, including pregnant people, newborns, older adults and those with weakened immune systems, listeriosis can be severe. It can cause bloodstream infections, meningitis, or pregnancy complications like preterm labor, miscarriage and stillbirth. Listeria infection is the third leading cause of death from foodborne infection in the United States, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Each year, about 172 people die from infection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms should people watch for? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:   Symptoms of listeriosis often start with fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea or diarrhea. In more serious cases, the infection spreads beyond the gut and can cause severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, seizures and whole-body infection resulting in organ failure. Pregnant patients may experience only mild flu-like symptoms, but the infection can be devastating to a developing fetus.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is listeria diagnosed and treated? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Doctors diagnose listeriosis through laboratory testing, usually by identifying the bacteria in a blood sample, spinal fluid or other body fluid. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary beyond monitoring symptoms, but in more severe cases, antibiotics are required. Pregnant people, newborns, older adults and immunocompromised individuals may be hospitalized for closer monitoring and supportive care. Early diagnosis and treatment significantly improve outcomes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What should consumers do if they have the recalled products at home? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Anyone who purchased the recalled pasta meals should not eat them, even if they look or smell fine. The bacteria can’t be seen, smelled or tasted. And just because someone else has eaten it and has not gotten sick doesn’t mean that it’s safe for you to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Check your refrigerator and freezer for any recalled brands or packaging, and either return them to the store or throw them away in a sealed plastic bag to prevent cross-contamination. Wash and sanitize any surfaces, shelves or containers that may have come into contact with the recalled products. If you or a family member has eaten one of the recalled foods and developed symptoms consistent with listeriosis, contact your health care provider.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: As we head into the holiday season, what can people do to reduce their chances of getting sick from foodborne bacteria? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The high-profile outbreaks that make headlines can give the impression that foodborne illnesses mainly come from restaurants or packaged foods purchased in stores. In reality, only a small portion of cases are traced to commercial products; most occur in our own kitchens, where bacteria and viruses can easily spread through everyday handling of food. Practicing careful hygiene and safe cooking habits at home is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of infection.\n \n\n   \n  Among all foodborne pathogens,  norovirus  is the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness in the US. It spreads quickly from person to person and through contaminated food, especially when infected individuals handle meals before or during preparation.\n \n\n   \n  Frequent, thorough handwashing with soap and water is essential, especially before cooking, after using the bathroom and after touching shared surfaces. Anyone with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or stomach cramps should stay home and avoid preparing or serving food to others until they have been symptom-free for at least two days. This applies not only to norovirus but to other contagious gastrointestinal ailments as well.\n \n\n   \n  Undercooked meat, poultry and seafood are another leading source of  foodborne illness , including infections from bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli .  Cooking foods to their  proper internal temperatures  kills these pathogens: Chicken, turkey and other poultry should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius); fish should be cooked to 145 F (63 C); and ground meats such as beef or pork should reach at least 160 F (71 C). Using a food thermometer is the most reliable way to ensure these temperatures are met.\n \n\n   \n  Cross-contamination is also a frequent problem. Cutting boards, knives and plates that have been in contact with raw meat, seafood or poultry should never be reused for cooked or ready-to-eat foods unless they have been thoroughly washed in hot, soapy water. Keeping separate utensils and cutting surfaces for raw and cooked foods greatly reduces the risk of spreading bacteria.\n \n\n   \n  Fresh fruits and vegetables should always be washed, even if they’ll be peeled before eating. Rinsing under running water is usually sufficient; avoid using soaps or household cleaners, which can leave residues that are unsafe to consume. For firm produce like melons or cucumbers, using a clean brush can help remove dirt and bacteria from the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Proper storage is another key part of prevention. Perishable foods should be refrigerated within two hours of cooking — or within one hour if the air temperature is above 90 F (32 C). Leftovers should be stored in shallow containers so they cool quickly, and refrigerators should be kept at 40 F (4 C) or lower. Freezers should be set at 0 F (-18 C) or below. Food left out too long provides ideal conditions for bacteria such as listeria and staphylococcus to multiply rapidly.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid unpasteurized milk and dairy products, as well as juices or ciders that have not been pasteurized, since these can contain harmful bacteria. Pregnant people, older adults and anyone with a weakened immune system should be particularly careful to avoid these products, as they carry a higher risk of serious illness.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to local and national health advisories. Health departments and the CDC frequently issue alerts when contaminated foods are identified or when outbreaks are detected at local restaurants or grocery chains. Following these updates and checking your kitchen for recalled items can help you act quickly to prevent illness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-pardon-letter-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:50:00-05:00","title":"Trump Pens Letter Asking Israeli President to Pardon Netanyahu in Corruption Trial","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, US President Donald Trump wrote a letter to Israeli President Isaac Herzog requesting a full pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing criminal charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in multiple cases.

    \nUpdated: \n        7:50 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Trump penned a letter asking the  Israeli  president to grant a full pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter distributed by the Israeli president’s spokesperson, Trump wrote, “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  For any other president, the letter would be an unusual intervention in the domestic politics of a foreign country. But it’s only Trump’s latest effort to intervene on behalf of one of his most vocal international supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases which began in Trump’s first term. He has entered a plea of not guilty and maintains his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that the ‘case’ against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political,  unjustified prosecution,” Trump wrote in the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceremonial nature of the role, Herzog has the power to issue pardons. But the request must come from the individual accused of wrongdoing, their legal representatives or a family member. Neither Netanyahu nor any of his close associates have submitted such a petition.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Herzog’s office said that he holds Trump “in high regard” and appreciates his “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza, and the safeguarding of Israel’s security”.\n \n\n   \n  But Herzog’s office also said that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump backs global allies\n \n\n   \n  Trump has weighed in on Netanyahu’s trial several times before. In June, after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he wrote a lengthy post on Truth Social in which he called Netanyahu’s trial a “ridiculous witch hunt,” echoing language he’s used about his own legal threats.\n \n\n   \n  And last month, during his short trip to Israel, Trump raised the issue of a pardon during his address to Israel’s parliament.\n \n\n   \n  Turning to Herzog seated nearby, he said, “Mr. President, why don’t you give him a pardon?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new letter sparked conflicting reactions across the Israeli political spectrum.\n \n\n   \n  Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: “President Herzog, listen to President Trump!”, he said, claiming that the “disgraceful” indictments against Netanyahu “have long since become an indictment against the prosecution itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Opposition Leader Yair Lapid responded to the letter in a statement, saying, “A reminder: Israeli law clearly stipulates that the first condition for a presidential pardon is admitting guilt and expressing remorse.”\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office.\n \n\n   \n  His trial on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust began in May 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of testimony, judgment, and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.\n \n\n   \n  It is not the first time Trump attempted to intervene in overseas ongoing judicial proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  In July, in a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to end their prosecution of another international ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has since been convicted of plotting a coup, saying Bolsonaro was “not guilty of anything, except having fought for people.”\n \n\n   \n  In April, he came out in support of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, when she was barred from running for political office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.\n \n\n   \n  “The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison,” he posted. “It is the same ‘playbook’ that was used against me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/pope-leo-favorite-movies-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00-05:00","title":"Pope Leo shares his all-time favorite movies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV has revealed his favorite films—'It’s a Wonderful Life' (1946), 'The Sound of Music' (1965), 'Ordinary People' (1980), and 'Life Is Beautiful' (1997)—all of which explore themes of hope, love, human dignity, and resilience in the face of tragedy.

shift in computing is on the horizon (and it’s not AI) \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Creating revolutionary pharmaceutical drugs, testing new materials for cars and simulating how market scenarios can affect banks — these are just some of the tasks that could take months or years to develop, even with the most advanced computers.\n \n\n   \n  But what if that timeframe could be cut down to minutes or hours?\n \n\n   \n  That’s the promise behind quantum computing, a field that’s been studied for decades and has garnered increasing   interest — and investments —  from tech giants  and startups alike.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, IBM revealed its new experimental Loon processor and Nighthawk quantum computing chip, which can perform more complex computations than its predecessor. The past two years have seen   quantum-related announcements from  Google , Microsoft and other tech companies.\n \n\n   \n  Quantum computing could potentially lead to a $1.3 trillion increase in value across certain industries by 2035, according to  McKinsey & Company , and for good reason. Experts believe quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in fields like cryptography, finance, science and transportation, and IBM  says  the technology could solve some problems in minutes or hours that would typically take non-quantum standard computers thousands of years.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s a long road ahead. Cracking quantum computing isn’t a matter of upgrading existing computers. It’s an entirely separate approach to computing that relies on the principles of quantum physics.\n \n\n   \n  “A fighter jet is not a faster Ferrari because it has wings,” said Sridhar Tayur, a professor with Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. “Quantum computing is not just a faster classical computer, because it works on a different principle.”\n \n\n   \n    What makes quantum computers different?\n \n\n   \n  Computers store and process information using a language made up of zeros and ones, also known as “bits.” But quantum computing uses “quantum bits,” also known as “qubits.” Instead of being either zero or one, qubits can behave like zero or one simultaneously and exist in states between zero and one, allowing them to process information much more quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Picture it as a flipping coin, as CNN’s  Anna Stewart explained . Bits are the coin when it lands on heads or tails, while qubits are the coin as it’s spinning between heads and tails, or if the coin could represent heads and tails at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  But   don’t expect quantum computers to replace your laptop or smartphone. Instead, these types of computers are ideal for solving big-picture problems involving chemistry and mathematics, making them potentially game-changing in areas such as health, environmental studies, finance, materials science and cryptography.\n \n\n   \n  BMW Group and Airbus, for example, are working with quantum computing startup Quantinuum to research how the technology could be used in the development of fuel cells. Meanwhile, Accenture Labs, biotechnology firm Biogen and quantum computing company 1QBit are  collaborating on research  related to drug discovery. Quantum computers can compare molecules that are much larger than the ones classical computers can compute, Accenture said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  “The big hope is that a quantum computer can simulate any sort of chemical or biological experiment you would do in the lab,” said Anand Natarajan, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences   at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  Quantum computing could be hugely influential when it comes to cryptography and cybersecurity since it can be used to break codes used to protect data, said Natarajan.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s also a major motivation, to make sure that our adversaries cannot do it and that we have this capability,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The  Wall Street Journal  reported in October that a handful of quantum computing companies were discussing potential deals with the Commerce Department that would provide federal funding in exchange for an equity stake.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN that it “is not currently negotiating equity stakes with quantum computing companies.”\n \n\n   \n    The race to crack quantum computing\n \n\n   \n  But the industry has a wave of challenges to overcome before quantum computing can solve modern dilemmas. For example, qubits are extremely fragile, making them very susceptible to external factors like changes in temperature or light.\n \n\n   \n  IBM’s new experimental Loon processor attempts to address this hurdle by demonstrating that the components exist to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer at scale that can function effectively even when errors are present. It’s an important step because errors are inevitable given qubits are so susceptible to interference.\n \n\n   \n  “If I just vibrate a table, I’ll kill our quantum computers. If a little bit of light gets in there, it can hurt it,” said Jay Gambetta, director of research at IBM.\n \n\n   \n  IBM’s new Nighthawk chip, meanwhile, can run more complicated “gates,” according to Gambetta. Gates are the “building blocks” quantum computers use to process information, as the  National Institute of Standards and Technology  describes it.\n \n\n   \n  IBM is just one contender in the quantum computing race. Microsoft in February introduced its  Majorana 1 quantum computing chip . That chip contains a special material the company says can create a new state of matter capable of producing more stable qubits. Google in December  unveiled its Willow quantum computing chip  that it says reduces errors as more qubits are used and can do in five minutes what would take a classical computer 10 septillion years.\n \n\n   \n    There are still some ways to go\n \n\n   \n  The jury is still out on exactly when quantum computing will live up to its potential.\n \n\n   \n  Natarajan believes we’re still likely a decade or two away.  McKinsey said  72% of the tech executives, investors and academics it spoke with say a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer could arrive by 2035. IBM expects to reach fault-tolerant quantum computing by the end of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  But when it does happen, the benefits could be tremendous.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, in some sense … we are trying to do brain surgery using a spoon and a fork. But ideally, to do brain surgery, you would need far more refined tools,” said Tayur of Carnegie Mellon. “And that far more refined tools (are) one of the promises of the quantum computer.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/bees-visual-stimulus-study-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"07:10:00-05:00","title":"Scientists Now Know That Bees Can Process Time, a First in Insects","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study led by doctoral student Alex Davidson and senior lecturer Elisabetta Versace at Queen Mary University of London reveals that bumblebees can process the duration of light flashes—distinguishing between short (0.5 seconds) and long (up to 5 seconds)—to decide where to forage for food.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bumblebees can process the duration of flashes of light and use the information to decide where to look for food, a new study has found.\n \n\n   \n  This is the first evidence of such an ability in insects, according to doctoral student Alex Davidson and his supervisor Elisabetta Versace, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London. The discovery could help settle a long-standing debate among scientists about whether insects are able to process complex patterns, Versace told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, it was thought that they were just very basic reflex machines that don’t have any flexibility,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  To reach its finding, the team set up a maze through which individual bees would travel when they left their nest to forage for food.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers presented the insects with two visual cues: one circle that would light up with a short flash and another with a long flash of light.\n \n\n   \n  Approaching these respective circles, the bees would find a sweet food that they like at one, and a bitter food, which they don’t, at the other.\n \n\n   \n  The circles were in different positions at each room in the maze, but the bees still learned over varying amounts of time to fly toward the short flash of light associated with the sweet food.\n \n\n   \n  Davidson and Versace then tested the bees’ behavior when there was no food present, to rule out the possibility that the bees could see or smell the sugary food.\n \n\n   \n  They found that the bees were able to tell the circles apart based on the duration of the flashes of light, rather than other cues.\n \n\n   \n  “And so in this way, we show that the bee is actually processing the time difference between them to guide its foraging choice,” Davidson said.\n \n\n   \n  “We were happy to see that, in fact, the bees can process stimuli that, during the course of evolution, they have never seen before,” Versace said, referring to the flashes of light.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re able to use novel stimulus they have never seen before to solve tasks in a flexible way,” Versace added. “I think this is really remarkable.”\n \n\n   \n  The researchers say bumblebees are one of only a small number of animals, including humans and other vertebrates such as macaques and pigeons, that have been found to be able to differentiate between short and long flashes, in this case between 0.5 and five seconds.\n \n\n   \n  For example, this ability helps humans to understand Morse code, in which a short flash is used to communicate the letter “E” and long flash the letter “T.”\n \n\n   \n    More than ‘just machines’\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear how bees are able to judge time duration, but the team plans to investigate the neural mechanisms that allow the insects to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists are also planning to conduct similar research with bees that are able to move freely in colonies, rather than individually, and investigate the cognitive differences that allow some bees to learn to assess time duration faster than others.\n \n\n   \n  Davidson hopes that the results will help people to appreciate that bees and other insects are not simple “machines essentially driven by instinct,” but rather “complex animals with inner lives that have unique experiences.”\n \n\n   \n  “In fact, they do have complex cognition, this flexibility in learning and memory and behavior,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  This may help people to perceive bees as more than unthinking pollinators, Versace said.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not just machines for our purposes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings also raise important ideas about our own understanding of time, according to Davidson.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s such a fundamental part of our lives and the lives of all animals,” but we still don’t really understand what time is and how we deal with it in our minds, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study is really interesting because it shows that it’s not just a human question,” Davidson said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers reported their findings Wednesday in the journal  Biology Letters .\n \n\n   \n  The study shows “that bees possess a sophisticated sense of time,” according to Cintia Akemi Oi, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research at University College London. Oi was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “This finding makes perfect sense, as bees must carefully manage their time while foraging to maximize rewards and minimize the costs of returning to the nest,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Such studies not only help to understand insect cognition, but also shed light on the shared and unique features of their neuronal functions, offering valuable insights to the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Jolyon Troscianko, a visual ecologist at the University of Exeter in England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the results show that the bees “must be using learning that can measure the length of time.”\n \n\n   \n  The method shows that bees can learn using information from outside their usual ecological context, “which I find fascinating as it demonstrates how this type of general learning can be achieved with brains many orders of magnitude smaller than the birds and rodents that prior work has focused on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Bigger brains are therefore not always necessary to show really impressive cognitive abilities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/middleeast/west-bank-settler-violence-arson-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launched an arson attack in the West Bank, targeting the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory near Beit Lid, destroying vehicles, property, and causing injuries to four Palestinians.

This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/doj-investigation-berkeley-turning-point-protests-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"05:34:00-04:00","title":"Justice Department Investigating UC Berkeley Protests During Turning Point USA Event","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department, including the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Civil Rights Division, has launched an investigation into protests that occurred at the University of California, Berkeley, during a Turning Point USA event on November 11, 2025.

    4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Atlanta mom Amanda James’ heart shattered when her soon-to-be 11-year-old uttered the words: “Mom, I don’t have to have a birthday party this year.”\n \n\n   \n  Her son knew both James, a Federal Aviation Administration airway transportation systems specialist and mother of four, and her husband, an air traffic controller, weren’t receiving paychecks during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “That absolutely broke my heart,” James explained to CNN. “(I told him), ‘That is not for you to worry about.’ I was like, ‘No, whatever you want to do that day, that’s what we’re going to do.’ It hurt my feelings so bad that a coming 11-year-old was concerned about something he shouldn’t have to be concerned with.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s one of the agonizing conversations playing out in the homes of many federal employees across the country as they wait for the government to finally reopen.\n \n\n   \n  James, who is a representative of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, is one of 5,000 workers maintaining FAA equipment, along with 14,000 air traffic controllers, who are all working without a paycheck. This week, a small group of Senate Democrats voted  with Republicans  to  approve a funding measure  that could  end the longest shutdown in US history.  The measure now advances to the House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, a record number of air traffic controllers took unscheduled time off causing a cascading effect of hourslong delays for travelers. At the same time, the FAA slashed flights at 40 US airports, so controllers who do show up could safely handle the traffic.\n \n\n   \n  For James, who’s been at the FAA for over three years, when she saw news of a deal this week, she said, “I’ll believe it whenever I see it done.” James and her husband, a controller with the FAA for over 11 years, have been through shutdowns before, and have been saving in case another one should happen.\n \n\n   \n    Navigating a crisis within aviation\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the loss of pay for essential FAA employees a “crisis within aviation” as he spoke to reporters at Central Wisconsin Airport in Wausau, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the country from the James family, another married set of FAA employees, both controllers, share the hope that the shutdown ends this week. All of the family’s extra income has been “dumped” into a new home they are building for retirement. The couple, who wished to remain anonymous when discussing their jobs, are close to retirement age but not quite there yet.\n \n\n   \n  They have saved some money, but at one point it seemed like the shutdown was going to go on forever.\n \n\n   \n  “The worries of when it was going to end, because it didn’t look like there was any end in sight: we weren’t sure how that was going to pan out, but I don’t know,” the controller told CNN. “It’s not comforting.”\n \n\n   \n  They worked every day of the shutdown they could, but did take some time off when they were simply too exhausted to work.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is with air traffic controllers, the American people feel that probably most acutely when they’re not paid,” Duffy said. “A lot of them have taken leave. They’re not coming into towers. That has created significant disruption throughout aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy has said some controllers may be calling out in protest, while others could be working other jobs to support their family. Some simply get sick or become exhausted from the stress of not knowing when they will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “We are here to ensure that the flying public is safe and to continue maintaining those standards of safety,” James said. “The added stress of everything going on, you don’t want (that), and somebody who’s distracted mentally or emotionally or financially having to come to work.”\n \n\n   \n  Compounding the unscheduled time off due to the shutdown, it’s also cold and flu season, James said, and many people in her Atlanta facility cannot work right now due to illness.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump demanded Monday all controllers “get back to work, NOW” on Truth Social, recommending a bonus of $10,000 per controller who didn’t take time off during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But for the James family, they presumably won’t get bonuses since they did take time off when the family got sick.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to say we didn’t have to, but unfortunately, we both were sick and our kids got sick… If we hadn’t actually been sick, we would have been at work,” James said. “We don’t like calling out because that can increase the workload for others.”\n \n\n   \n    Making tough decisions for family\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference Tuesday afternoon at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said air traffic controllers will get most of their back pay shortly after funding resumes.\n \n\n   \n  “I mentioned I wanted air traffic controllers to come back to work,” Duffy said. “So to be clear, anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens, they are going to get … 70% of their pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The remaining 30% will come about a week later, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of banking (on the shutdown to end this week),” the controller who wishes to remain anonymous said. “I would have never thought in a million years – 40 something days – that we would have gone like that. It’s not something that’s not in the back of my mind.”\n \n\n   \n  The end to the shutdown can’t come soon enough for the James family either.\n \n\n   \n  It has caused her to put off a medical procedure she needed. Her insurance only partially covers it, she said, and it would take away thousands of dollars they need to survive should the shutdown continue.\n \n\n   \n  James and her husband, who met in the Army, are looking to foster a high school-aged girl, in addition to raising their four boys, and they won’t let the shutdown stop them from pursuing that. James is a licensed cosmetologist and said if the shutdown doesn’t wrap up this week, she’s going to talk to some salons to see what side work she can do on her days off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/white-house-website-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"How the Trump Administration Seeks to 'Weaponize' the White House Website to Troll Democrats and Amplify Its Message","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has significantly altered the official White House website (whitehouse.gov) from its original role as a neutral, informative government resource into a politically aggressive platform.

Intended to be a source of government information for Americans and a connection to the White House from their homes, Clinton stressed that leaders have the responsibility to use tools like the website “to expand the reach of democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve made the website a permanent part of the Executive Office of the President, so that future presidents will be able to change it to suit their needs as easily as they can change the furniture here in the Oval Office,” Clinton said.\n \n\n   \n  Twenty-five years later, President Donald Trump has done  far more   than just   swap out   the furniture , and the sound of construction is not unusual on White House grounds. The aggressive remodel has extended online, where the second Trump administration has transformed the government website into a tool to troll Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a timer on the White House website tracks how long “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government” down to the second, even as Senate Democrats joined with Republicans on Monday to advance a funding measure. A  “mysafespace”  webpage, in the style of the early 2000s site MySpace, mocks Democrats and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, dubbing him “Sombrero Guy” and “Dollar Store Obama,” while claiming his heroes are “transnational gangs, illegal immigrants” and radical leftists.\n \n\n   \n   And amid public outrage over  Trump’s demolition of the East Wing  for his new ballroom, the administration has added several controversial, and in some cases mischaracterized, intervals to a timeline of White House construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We use it to really drive a message,” a White House official said. “The website is informative in a lot of different ways, but it’s also a vehicle to push our message, and we’re able to weaponize it in a way that no other administration has been able to do.”\n \n\n   \n  But while the second Trump administration’s  social media strategy  has long embraced memes and videos mocking Democrats, former White House officials are raising concerns about the irreverent approach bleeding over to a website previously geared toward historical and informational ends.\n \n\n   \n  And that uproar is part of the White House’s intention – to spread its message further.\n \n\n   \n  “The outrage on the left is great because they’re just consumed with it,” the White House official said. “It’s great for our base, because they’re able to take a screenshot or a snippet of the timeline and post it on social media.”\n \n\n   \n    Following Trump’s lead\n \n\n   \n  The digital strategy under the Trump administration, the White House official said, is to not only follow the president’s lead but to amplify it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s spitballing with ideas on the fly. I mean, a lot of it is what we say, ‘Follow the leader,’ which is what President Trump has done on social media, and just amplify it. And, you know, try to take it to the next level,” they said, pointing to the sombrero memes.\n \n\n   \n  What began with Trump resharing an AI-generated  racist and vulgar video  of Jeffries in a sombrero alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the White House morphed into taunts on social media to increase the size of the sombrero until the shutdown ends. And the meme has now crossed over to the White House website, where on the “mysafespace” page, dozens of sombreros appear in the background, and mariachi music starts playing when users hit the play button.\n \n\n   \n  It pairs with an “About me” section that claims Democrats “couldn’t care less if our men and women in uniform get paid or if our neighborhoods are safe – we just love playing politics with people’s livelihoods.” And if users click on an option for “Contacting Hakeem,” the White House website generates a draft email to Jeffries’ and Schumer’s offices with prewritten text asking to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether there are any lines the White House isn’t willing to cross, the official said, “There’s certainly lines.”\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t do anything that’s overtly political, right? You can’t run afoul of the Hatch Act,” they said, referring to legislation that  prohibits the federal government  and its employees, except for the president and vice president, from “engaging in partisan political activity,” including on social media. The official added, “We’re doing everything within the framework of what’s allowable.”\n \n\n   \n  The aggressive approach strikes David Almacy, former White House internet and e-communications director under President George W. Bush’s administration, as a significant shift from past presidencies.\n \n\n   \n  Almacy said he viewed whitehouse.gov as a way to keep Americans apprised on what the president was doing on a daily basis, contribute to a larger historical record of the president’s entire term and provide “an accurate historical and factual record of the White House as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was very sort of like nondescript, the headlines. There was no political tone to it,” he recalled, adding the Bush administration tried to “adhere to the spirit of the Hatch Act.” “It was never derogatory. It was never meant to divide. It was meant to inform.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think now it appears that mostly it’s being used as a political tool,” Almacy said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Everybody is more unfiltered’\n \n\n   \n  It’s “an outdated view,” a Republican digital operative familiar with the Trump administration’s digital efforts said, to think of the White House website as somewhere that a grade-school student goes to cite a paper, given “there are far more comprehensive historical resources.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not about party. Everybody is more online. Everybody is more unfiltered. Everybody is more human sounding and authentic, and websites don’t sound like press releases anymore,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  But former officials who worked on the White House website in past administrations say that the official government website should be a trusted and reliable resource, not be a place for mischaracterizing the truth and taking cheap shots at the opposing party.\n \n\n   \n  “Citizens need to be able to rely on whitehouse.gov, and that public trust in government breaks down when there’s information that is politically motivated, especially in contexts that are meant to be historically grounded versus an administration’s individual priorities and issues,” Ashleigh Axios, a former creative director within the Office of Digital Strategy in the Obama administration, said in an interview with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to edits to the  White House’s “About” page  amid outrage over the East Wing demolition as “a misuse of whitehouse.gov and a misuse of government properties.”\n \n\n   \n  This includes a picture marking Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the “Major Events Timeline” – part of several additions, including “Cocaine Discovered,”  falsely linking  former President Joe Biden’s son Hunter to cocaine found at the White House in 2023; a “Muslim Brotherhood Visit” under the Obama administration, which misleadingly uses a pre-presidency photo of Obama in Somali dress during a visit to Kenya; and the establishment of a  “Trans Day of Visibility”  under Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We called it internally the ‘Easter eggs’ to see if anyone would find it,” the Trump White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The timeline additions, which the official said pointed out hypocrisy, are unrelated to other items detailing construction projects at the White House. Key context is left out; photos misrepresent the facts and the new highlighted events clearly target Democratic administrations. On the page, the “East Wing Expansion Stages” are explained, but its demolition isn’t.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for TMZ to write up the changes to the timeline, which White House communications director Steven Cheung reposted on X, writing, “HAHAHAHAHA!”\n \n\n   \n  The timeline stood out to Axios, the Obama administration official, who posted  on LinkedIn , “Misinformation has no place on the White House website.”\n \n\n   \n  “WhiteHouse.gov isn’t just another website,” she said. “It’s the digital front door of the presidency.”\n \n\n   \n  But to White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr, the additions to the timeline are just “unfortunate truths.” And he hinted more to come.\n \n\n   \n  “These are truths. There is no misinformation. If  WhiteHouse.gov  is the front door of a presidency then our site is a reflection of the most innovative and communicative President in history. The facts will continue. The memes will continue. Enjoy :),” Dorr  posted on X  in response to Axios.\n \n\n   \n  Macon Phillips, the former director of digital strategy at the White House in the Obama era, argued that the Trump administration’s provocative approach should be ignored. He characterized the strategy as a distraction from real issues facing Americans, like  rising health care premiums  – the key sticking point for Democrats during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Red herring is when they used to take spoiled fish and drag it across the field to get the hounds off the scent of the fox,” Phillips said. “This strategy that they have is meant to get us talking about this, instead of the fact that health insurance premiums in Vermont, where I live, are about to be gutted and people are going to die.”\n \n\n   \n    An evolving digital landscape\n \n\n   \n  While no previous administration has used the White House website quite as aggressively as the Trump administration, some digital teams have gotten in hot water for certain content posted on the site.\n \n\n   \n  Obama’s second-term digital team  once faced backlash  for adding content to former presidential biographies that tied to the administration’s initiatives at the time, while the Bush administration’s digital team couldn’t hyperlink to sites outside of .gov and .mil., even nonprofits, like the Red Cross.\n \n\n   \n  “Links to private media outlets with advertising, one could argue, could financially benefit those outlets if they write positive coverage,” Almacy, the Bush administration official, recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “Our rules were pretty strict,” he added, noting how social media changed the digital landscape. “Now, it seems like it’s off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican digital operative said in his view, the biography of Trump on the Biden White House website “reads a little political.”\n \n\n   \n  The Biden-era  White House website  factually includes Trump’s impeachments; the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot; the death count during the coronavirus pandemic; and the late 2018 government shutdown. But it also lists his achievements on signing a major tax reform law and moving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Almacy also recalled tone shifts on the Obama website,  like a 2010 blog post , where the administration wrote, “The President blasts Republicans in the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  But he questioned how Republicans would react if the Obama administration made similar politically motivated additions to the “Major Events Timeline.” After years of working on the website, he said he doesn’t visit it anymore.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s imagine that Barack Obama posted things on white house.gov that were just completely derogatory and accusatory and attacking of Republicans. How do you think the Republicans would take that?” Almacy said. “This is the precedent that’s being set.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/linda-sun-new-york-chinese-agent","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Former aide to two NY governors, accused of being Chinese agent, goes on trial for money laundering and fraud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Linda Sun, a former aide to New York Governors Kathy Hochul and Andrew Cuomo, is set to go on trial in Brooklyn for allegedly acting as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party.

Hu, a US citizen, operated numerous businesses, including a seafood export business, in New York, the indictment alleges.\n \n\n   \n  In January 2019, prosecutors allege, Sun wrote to a Chinese government official, “I very much value my relationship with the consulate and have done many things to make the relationship between the state and the consulate flourish during my tenure with (Politician-1).

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the end, there was no honeymoon period.\n \n\n   \n  Just two weeks ago,  Japan’s  new prime minister Sanae Takaichi was shaking hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, relations between the two Asian nations have dramatically soured, with escalating nationalist rhetoric in  China  and even an apparent threat of beheading from one of its diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi, who was elected as Japan’s  first female prime minister  just last month, has become embroiled in a growing row with Beijing over Taiwan – the democratic island that China’s ruling Communist Party claims as its own, and a red line  it has warned  other countries not to cross.\n \n\n   \n  The furor began when Takaichi  told the Japanese parliament  on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan – which lies just 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Japanese territory – would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival” and could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of the island and has ramped up the frequency and complexity of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “ strategic ambiguity .”\n \n\n   \n  Wading into the thorny issue of Taiwan’s defense has gotten other world leaders in hot water with Beijing before. Former US President Joe Biden set off a diplomatic panic during his time in office when he  said multiple times  that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan – forcing the White House to repeatedly walk back his comments, and sparking anger each time in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s remarks were met with an even more vehement response.\n \n\n   \n  “The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” wrote the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  The fallout has  spiraled  since, with Japan criticizing Xue’s “extremely inappropriate” post and Taiwan voicing concern about Xue’s “threatening” remarks, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, meanwhile, has defended its position and Xue’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry on Monday accused Japan of “grossly interfering with China’s internal affairs,” saying Xue’s post was simply responding to Takaichi’s “erroneous and dangerous remarks.”\n \n\n   \n  For some, the controversy harks back to China’s “ wolf warrior ” diplomacy – an aggressive style of foreign policy that emerged in the early 2020s, which often saw Chinese officials take to social media platforms to hit back directly - and often colorfully - at any criticism of China, but has since been dialed back as Beijing looked to win back lost goodwill among Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  And within China, where there is already significant streak of anti-Japanese sentiment, state media and other prominent voices this week have further fanned outrage over Takaichi’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily condemned Takaichi as “recklessly shooting her mouth off,” and warning: “No one should harbor any illusion that they can cross the line on the Taiwan issue without paying a price.”\n \n\n   \n  A social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV asked: “Has her head been kicked by a donkey?”\n \n\n   \n  Hu Xijin, a Chinese pundit and former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times, offered a more violent warning, echoing the threats from the diplomat Xue.\n \n\n   \n  “China’s battle blade for beheading invaders has been sharpened to a very keen edge,” he wrote in a post on Tuesday. “If Japanese militarism wishes to come to the Taiwan Strait to sacrifice themselves on our blades, we will fulfill them.”\n \n\n   \n    A tangled relationship\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi said Monday that her comments were “hypothetical,” and said she would avoid making similar comments in parliament again. But the prime minister is walking a  tightrope  every Japanese leader has had to balance.\n \n\n   \n  China remains Japan’s largest trading partner, and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes.  At the same time, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative views, like her mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity and criticized Beijing’s growing military presence in the region.\n \n\n   \n  This uneasy relationship was on display when  Takaichi met Xi  at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October. The two leaders agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship,” Takaichi said afterward; however, she also raised with Xi the hot-button issue of China’s activity in the East China Sea, including around islands claimed by both countries.\n \n\n   \n  Even before she took office, Takaichi’s stance on Taiwan was clear. She visited the island earlier this year and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. During the APEC summit, she also met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  The current spat comes during a year when Japan-China relations are already strained, in part because of Tokyo’s colonial and war-time past.\n \n\n   \n  September marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Beijing commemorated with a  massive military parade . There’s longstanding historical hostility between the two countries; China was a crucial Allied partner, fighting against Japan’s full-scale invasion that ended only with Tokyo’s formal surrender in 1945.\n \n\n   \n  The scars of that era run deep. Japanese Imperial troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the  Nanjing Massacre  – one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the parade, Chinese officials ramped up their rhetoric and accused Japan of whitewashing history. Adding fuel to the fire, China also released at least  four WWII films this year,  including some that depict the Nanjing Massacre and the sinking of a Japanese vessel.\n \n\n   \n  Fearing a spike in anti-Japanese sentiment ahead of the parade, the Japanese embassy in Beijing warned its citizens to stay cautious and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public – perhaps mindful that in recent years, there has been a spate of  violent attacks  against  Japanese nationals in China .\n \n\n   \n  That complex history involves Taiwan, too.\n \n\n   \n  The island was once a Japanese colony that Imperial China had ceded to Imperial Japan. After Japan was defeated in WWII, China’s ruling Nationalists took control of Taiwan – then, several years later, fled to the island and moved their seat of government there after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n \n\n   \n  Today, the CCP views the self-ruling island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary. Party leaders and state media have repeatedly claimed that the end of WWII marked the island’s return to Chinese rule and liberation from Japanese occupation – a view Chinese officials alluded to this week as they berated Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan holds historical responsibility towards the Chinese people regarding the Taiwan issue, having committed unmentionable crimes during the 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan,” said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday when asked about Takaichi’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Eighty years ago, we defeated the Japanese aggressors, restored Taiwan, and ended their occupation and plunder,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Should anyone again attempt to challenge China’s core interests” or thwart reunification with Taiwan, Chen said, Beijing “will never accept or tolerate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/redistricting-trump-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s 2026 redistricting scheme could wind up hurting democracy more than Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's push for aggressive redistricting in 2025 to create more GOP-leaning districts has not yielded the desired electoral gains for Republicans in 2026.

hurting democracy more than Democrats \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump marched the nation into a historic redistricting arms race with his brazen move to get red states to draw as many new GOP-leaning districts as possible.\n \n\n   \n  Already, more states have voluntarily redrawn their congressional maps in the middle of a decade than had done so  in the last half-century combined .\n \n\n   \n  And it was an arms race the  GOP was always likely to win , given the power dynamics involved.\n \n\n   \n  But four months into the battle, the GOP’s gains are looking relatively muted. Indeed, it’s looking like Trump’s move could be much more damaging to democracy — by normalizing these kinds of bare-knuckle political tactics for years to come — than to the Democratic Party in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Appropriately enough for the Trump era, the biggest victim here could wind up being our political norms.\n \n\n   \n  While much remains to be determined, Democrats have benefited from a series of positive developments in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The big one, of course, was the easy passage last week of a California ballot measure that allows the party to  draw five new Democratic-leaning districts  in that state. Gov. Gavin Newsom launched that effort to offset the GOP’s gains in Texas, the state where Trump and the GOP started this war. And California voters overwhelmingly agreed (65%-35%) that retaliation was warranted.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have also benefited from a new compromise  map in Ohio that  wasn’t as bad for them  as it could have been, along with the  reluctance of Republicans in some red states  to heed Trump’s call to squeeze every district they can out of the process.\n \n\n   \n  The election results last week were also positive for Democrats in a few subtler ways.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Democrats greatly expanded their advantage in the Virginia House of Delegates and swept the state’s executive offices, which should help them press forward with drawing more Democratic-leaning districts.\n \n\n   \n  For two, the big swings toward Democrats from the 2024 elections might give Republicans pause about trying to draw too many more favorable districts. The more you draw, after all, the more it spreads your voters thin and risks your districts getting swept up in a wave election for the other side. (Want an example of how that can work?  See: the 1894 election .)\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight is such a blowout so far that I wonder if it gives some Rs pause about redistricting in states that are still pondering it,” Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics  said on X  on election night.\n \n\n   \n  And then came perhaps the most pleasant surprise of all for Democrats, on Monday in Utah. A federal judge threw out a Republican-drawn map and adopted an alternate one that gave Democrats  a new safely blue seat in Salt Lake City .\n \n\n   \n  So where does all this leave us? CNN’s elections team has  a great new tracker  where you can monitor it all.\n \n\n   \n  All told, Republicans have added an estimated nine new GOP targets in Texas, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri, while Democrats have added about six in California and Utah.\n \n\n   \n  The big questions from here are what happens in Florida and Virginia, where each side could gain three or more seats — Republicans in the former and Democrats in the latter. And seats could be in play for one side or the other in Indiana and Kansas (for Republicans) and Illinois and Maryland (for Democrats).\n \n\n   \n  We don’t yet know how that will shake out. Legal challenges loom over some of the states that have already moved or could move. Another major question is whether the Supreme Court opens the door to even more aggressive gerrymandering by striking down part of the Voting Rights Act — a move that could completely change the game in the South and  give Republicans a major advantage . That would likely impact elections held after 2026.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s entirely possible that, for 2026, Republicans could wind up netting about three to five seats total from this exercise. That’s where we’d be if every other state that’s in play actually followed through.\n \n\n   \n  And the GOP’s gains could be even less than that when you factor in how competitive some of these seats could be in a Democratic-leaning election, as  the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman notes .\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Democrats’ gains with Hispanic voters in last week’s elections make the Texas GOP’s hopes of winning two of the five new Republican-leaning districts look more tenuous. The GOP was banking on  maintaining Trump’s big gains with Hispanic voters in 2024 , but that’s looking like a not-so-great bet right now.\n \n\n   \n  And if the GOP nets only three to five seats, that’s likely to have negligible impact on who controls the House after the 2026 elections. That’s because the party that doesn’t hold the White House usually wins lots of seats in midterm elections — more than enough to cover the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Without any redistricting changes, Democrats need to flip three seats. A GOP gain of three to five seats would stretch that to Democrats needing to flip between six and eight seats.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition party has failed to win that many seats only nine times since the Civil War, and not once since 2002, according to  data from the Brookings Institution .\n \n\n   \n  Throw Trump’s significant unpopularity on top of that, and it appears unlikely that his redistricting gambit will ultimately do what he wanted: prevent Democrats from controlling the House for the president’s two final years in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what Trump will have done is saddle the country with a new political reality in which each side is tempted to redraw districts whenever it’s advantageous and  we get fewer and fewer competitive districts , as Kondik wrote last week.\n \n\n   \n  That’s something the American people  decidedly did not want . But it would be part of Trump’s norm-busting legacy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/syrias-postwar-pivot-reaches-washington-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:36:00-05:00","title":"Syria’s jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmed Al-Sharaa, a former jihadist fighter who joined Al-Qaeda-backed rebels in Syria’s civil war, has risen to become the country’s president after a surprise military offensive that toppled the 53-year rule of Bashar al-Assad.

Syria’s jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit \n       \n  Analysis by Mostafa Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:36 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – is his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-economy-white-house-strategy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"White House weighs stepped up domestic travel and speeches to improve Trump’s standing on the economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s advisers are discussing increased domestic travel and economy-focused speeches to improve public perception amid growing public anxiety over the cost of living.

the economy \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  advisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president has  bristled at in public : Americans’ outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration’s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren’t resonating.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t convince people that their experience, what they’re feeling at home, isn’t reality,” one of the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed by  rising prices , they said. They have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on Trump’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans’ economic anxiety are “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there’s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs.\n \n\n   \n  Two key factors last week — Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown — initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,” Trump said, responding to the criticism that  he was too busy meeting with foreign leaders . “But with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans’ perception of his administration’s handling of the economy and the media’s coverage of it.\n \n\n   \n  “The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official said. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing,” pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  acknowledged  that frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they were  getting “killed” politically  by the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It appears the shutdown could be over by week’s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed another  potential political liability  for the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week’s votes to reopen the government.)\n \n\n   \n    ‘We have the greatest economy ever’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed during Monday’s Fox News interview about why Americans say they’re down on the economy if he’s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,” Trump said. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In a  CNN poll  released last week, 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.)\n \n\n   \n  Some of the president’s defensive messaging has come from what he’s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They’ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. “The President’s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation — and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump — he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Trump’s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats’ affordability message as a “con job,” he’s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He’s floated  $2,000 tariff rebate checks  to lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he’s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with).\n \n\n   \n  All of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath.\n \n\n   \n  And while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week’s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden’s mistakes, which means taking Americans’ perceptions about the economy seriously — and doing something about it.\n \n\n   \n  With critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump’s term now less than a year away, they don’t see time to waste.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/jack-schlossberg-jfk-grandson-us-house-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:14:00-05:00","title":"Jack Schlossberg, John F.

Kennedy’s grandson, running for US House seat \n       \n  By Dana Bash, David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:14 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F. Kennedy, is announcing a run for the US House from New York City, becoming JFK’s first direct descendent and latest member of his family to run for elected office.\n \n\n   \n  In a video announcing his campaign, Schlossberg says the “country is at a turning point.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a crisis at every level, a cost-of-living crisis sponsored by the big, beautiful bill, historic cuts to social programs working families rely on health care, education, childcare, a corruption crisis,” Schlossberg said, focusing on affordability while criticizing President Donald Trump. “He’s picking winners and losers from inside the Oval Office, it’s cronyism, not capitalism and a constitutional crisis with one dangerous man in control of all three branches of government, he’s stripping citizens of their civil rights and silencing his critics.”\n \n\n   \n  Schlossberg is running to replace the retiring  Rep. Jerry Nadler , who represents New York’s 12th Congressional District.\n \n\n   \n  Without directly mentioning his famous lineage,   Schlossberg   describes himself as having been “born and raised” in the district, which stretches from Union Square up through Midtown and then to the Upper West and Upper East sides.\n \n\n   \n  “I took the bus to school every single day from one side of the district to the other,” Schlossberg said. He attended the private Collegiate School in New York.\n \n\n   \n  In advance his announcement, he told CNN he is a Democrat who represents “a new generation.” Schlossberg has become known for his viral videos on social media which are very freewheeling and unorthodox.\n \n\n   \n  He believes his understanding of how to communicate in the age of vertical video will help him connect with younger people. “In this toxic polluted media environment we are in — I breathe that air,” he told CNN. Schlossberg emerged as an outspoken voice calling for Democratic Party reforms after its losses in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Hey guys ? have formed an exploratory committee,” he wrote on social media in September, days after Nadler announced he would not seek reelection.\n \n\n   \n  Schlossberg, 32, the youngest child of Caroline Kennedy and her husband Edwin Schlossberg, told CNN that he would pay homage to his grandfather “organically,” noting that the 35th president “broke the mold.”\n \n\n   \n  Online and in media appearances, Schlossberg has aligned himself with the young, progressive wing of the Democratic Party pressing for generational change. He backed Mayor-elect  Zohran Mamdani  in the New York City mayor’s race, remarking, “I don’t give a f**k” about crossing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was previously married to Kerry Kennedy, John F. Kennedy’s niece.\n \n\n   \n  Three generations of Kennedys have served in elected office, including John F. Kennedy’s brothers Robert, a former attorney general and New York senator, and  Ted , the longtime senator from Massachusetts.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  is currently Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary, though much of the stalwart Democratic family has  disavowed  RFK Jr.’s views on politics and medicine. (Schlossberg posted on X in September: “RFK LOSER IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH and AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC LEADERSHIP.”)\n \n\n   \n  The contest to succeed Nadler could draw a wide field of contenders.\n \n\n   \n  Already running is Assemblyman Micah Lasher, seen as the candidate with Nadler’s backing, along with Liam Elkind, who started an organization during the Covid-19 pandemic that delivered food and medicine.\n \n\n   \n  Potential candidates also include: Former Rep. Carolyn Maloney, state assemblymembers Alex Bores and Tony Simone, New York City Council member Erik Bottcher, and Cameron Kasky, an activist and survivor of the Parkland High School shooting.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong performance in this year’s elections, Democrats are hopeful the 2026 midterm battle for control of the House and Senate will reinvigorate the party and help it push back against the president’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/style/joe-jonas-how-to-wear-a-casual-tie-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"06:09:00-04:00","title":"Look of the Week: Joe Jonas and the rise of the casual tie","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The casual tie has experienced a significant cultural and fashion revival, moving from formal settings to everyday wear.

By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:09 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Monday, Joe Jonas arrived at a taping of “Good Morning America” in New York looking a little bit like a high-school English teacher from 1998. His moss green zip-up Jacquemus sweater, worn atop a collared shirt and tie, with blue jeans and a Ford Mustang baseball cap, was a clunky collision of smart casual, but executed with a knowing wink.\n \n\n   \n  Ties, it seems, are no longer formal attire. Once they might have been reserved for weddings, funerals, business meetings, or galas; today they are being worn more liberally — and not necessarily with a suit. Just look at A$AP Rocky, who has been experimenting with styling the accessory in more playful ways. In one 2024 photo, he is seen pairing a Bottega Veneta pinstriped shirt with straight leg denim, a chunky patterned tie and a padded gilet. His counterparts are doing the same. Last May, fellow rapper Pusha T wore a Louis Vuitton tie and white shirt but eschewed the conventional tailored jacket for a zip-up leather hoodie.\n \n\n   \n  After surveying the street style of the attendees at Paris Fashion Week this year, GQ declared the tie was “so back.” Except this time, they looked looser — and often without a blazer in sight.\n \n\n   \n  You can blame Dior’s menswear show in June by Jonathan Anderson, the label’s creative director. Necks were a key focal point for Anderson here. His models’ decolletage was sometimes trussed up in silk cravats, or left entirely bare as they went shirtless under a jacket. When ties did pop up on the runway, they were styled  a la  naughty school boys — scrunched and worn inside-out, with careless half-popped collars.\n \n\n   \n  Anderson has also outfitted his roster of celebrity clients, who sit front row at his shows, in a similar way. A$AP Rocky wore his festive red and green tie asymmetrically over one collar, much like the sleepily dressed runway models — while British actors Josh O’Connor and Jonathan Bailey played it straight and stuck with convention. Bailey somewhat resembled a corporate tech bro, styling his tie with a shirt and blue Dior-logoed half-zip sweater.\n \n\n   \n  Men’s fashion preferences had been shifting away from neckties for several decades, driven by more casual dress codes in the workplace and a growing preference for comfort, even before the pandemic. In 2019, Hermès, best known for its silk accessories and leather handbags, reported slow growth in its silk and textiles unit for the previous year, with CEO Axel Dumas blaming the “structural decline” of neckties.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, journalist Jonah Weiner  wrote  in his menswear newsletter “Blackbird Spyplane” that his personal disdain for neckties came from the fact that, to him, they represented a “cursed Obama-era workplace cliche” and the “repressive gaze” of corporate overlords.\n \n\n   \n  When the workforce returned to their desks a year later, the tie didn’t always come with it: A photo of world leaders at the 2022 G7 summit circulated around the internet after people noticed that not one government representative — from former US President Joe Biden to President of France Emmanuel Macron — was wearing one. Gildo Zegna, chairman and chief executive of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group, shared a similar view when he  spoke  to the Business of Fashion that same year: “For the tie, I don’t see a good future.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, soon after, the tide changed. By 2023, GQ reported that neckties had become the hottest product at Hermès, as the brand developed new stylish options — some had more contemporary narrow widths; others were made from experimental fabrics like knit and even leather.\n \n\n   \n  Today, as changing social roles and gender equality ignites  conversations on what it means to be a man today , the adoption of the casual tie could be one response. Some critics see them as the modern-day codpiece (in the 16th century, the fabric pouch evolved from a practical modesty garment into a prominent fashion statement and symbol of masculinity). The phallic-shaped necktie, pointing like an arrow, directs attention from the wearer’s throat to groin as a masculine marker — which is why the recent spike in female wearers, including A-listers Zendaya, Mikey Madison, Iris Law, Madonna, Sabrina Carpenter, Hailey Bieber, Ayo Edibiri and Brooke Shields, is so powerful.\n \n\n   \n  Now, there are almost no rules on when to wear a tie. They can be worn with jeans, while running errands, under a sweatshirt or, if you are feeling old-school, to the office. The freedom to choose a tie, rather than feel mandated to wear one, makes the decision more creative. The Jonas brothers, who attended a red carpet premiere for their latest film just hours after their TV appearance Monday, each wore a suit. Ultimately they decided to skip the tie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/entertainment/paris-jackson-perforated-septum-drug-use","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000-05:00","title":"Paris Jackson reveals she has a perforated septum: ‘Don’t do drugs kids’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paris Jackson, the only daughter of pop icon Michael Jackson, revealed in a social media video that she has a perforated septum—a condition caused by drug use—highlighting her personal experience with addiction and recovery.

 \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Dozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the  COP30 climate summit  venue on Tuesday and clashed with security guards at the entrance to demand climate action and forest protection.\n \n\n   \n  Shouting angrily, protesters demanded access to the UN compound where thousands of delegates from countries around the world are attending this year’s  UN climate summit  in the Amazon city of Belém, Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  Some waved flags with slogans calling for land rights or carried signs saying, “Our land is not for sale.”\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name. “We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n \n\n   \n  Security guards pushed the protesters back and used tables to barricade the entrance. A Reuters witness saw one security guard being rushed away in a wheelchair while clutching his stomach.\n \n\n   \n  Another guard with a fresh cut above his eye told Reuters he had been hit in the head by a heavy drumstick thrown from the crowd. Security confiscated several long, heavy sticks.\n \n\n   \n  The protesters dispersed shortly after the clash. They had been in a group of hundreds who marched to the venue.\n \n\n   \n  Security guards later allowed delegates to exit the venue, having earlier asked them to move back inside until the area was clear. Within the compound, the United Nations is responsible for security.\n \n\n   \n  “Earlier this evening, a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Brazilian and UN security personnel took protective actions to secure the venue, following all established security protocols. Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident. The venue is fully secured, and COP negotiations continue.”\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, dozens of Indigenous leaders arrived by boat to participate in the talks and demand more say in how forests are managed.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate interview on Tuesday, a prominent Indigenous leader told Reuters that many from the Indigenous communities were upset with ongoing industry and development projects in the forest. Raoni Metuktire, also known as Chief Raoni, urged Brazil to empower native peoples to preserve the Amazon.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/mega-millions-billion-dollar-jackpot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Mega Millions jackpot nears $1 billion after there were no big winners in Tuesday’s drawing","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Mega Millions jackpot is approaching $1 billion due to no major winners in Tuesday’s drawing, with an estimated prize of $965 million for Friday’s drawing.

sent a funding bill to the House. Here’s what has to happen next to reopen the government \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Sarah Ferris, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:48 AM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senators have  approved a funding package  to reopen the federal government, sending the compromise deal to their colleagues in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Senate Democrats struck a deal over the weekend with Republicans to move forward the package, without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford health insurance. Ultimately,  eight members  of the Democratic caucus crossed lines to move a step closer to breaking the stalemate on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the focus is on the House, where GOP leaders believe lawmakers will end the stalemate this week.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.\n \n\n   \n    It’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  The Senate-passed package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through t﻿he remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin GOP majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson told his members Monday to start making their way back to Washington and put them on 36-hour vote notice after the Senate passed the continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m stating the obvious: All my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible,” the Republican leader said Monday.\n \n\n   \n    When will the House vote?\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to begin voting on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer.\n \n\n   \n  The vote will take place as early as 4 p.m., per the notice, which forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The House Rules Committee voted on party lines early Wednesday morning to advance the Senate-passed package to reopen the government, a key hurdle the bill needed to clear before a floor vote.\n \n\n   \n  The panel did not adopt any amendments offered in committee during the seven-hour meeting, including amendments extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Next, the full House will have to take a procedural vote on the rule, expected to happen on Wednesday, before moving to vote on final passage of the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The House hasn’t voted or been in legislative session since September 19.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the lawmakers to watch?\n \n\n   \n  Johnson will have to work closely with the White House to muscle this deal through the House, given it is unclear how many Democrats will cross over to support the package and Republicans hold such a narrow majority.\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen moderate House Republicans had wanted to see the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies extended and had their  own bill   to address the issue at the center of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, House Democratic leadership is actively working to prevent rank-and-file members from voting for this bill because they say it falls short of what Democrats fought for during the shutdown. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who is not seeking reelection and has been known to vote with Republicans, is among those to watch.\n \n\n   \n    What are House Democratic leaders saying?\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his team hope to limit the number of Democrats who support the plan, which will maximize pressure on House Republicans to land the votes themselves. And House Democratic leaders are officially whipping against the Senate funding compromise, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The House Democratic leader reiterated to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that Democrats will “strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican health care crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to reopen the government. We’ll continue to stand by our hardworking federal employees and civil servants. But we have a responsibility to make sure that we extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so that tens of millions of Americans don’t experience dramatically increased health care costs that’s going to prevent them from being able to see a doctor when they need one,” Jeffries said on “The Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n    Does the government open as soon as the House passes the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Not quite yet.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What does Trump think of the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has already endorsed the Senate plan to reopen the government, calling the funding deal a “positive development” toward ending the record-long shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” a White House official said in a statement. “The action in the Senate is a positive development and we look forward to seeing it progress.”\n \n\n   \n  And adding to expectation that Trump will sign the measure, the president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I would say so,” when asked whether he personally approved of the deal making its way through Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said Monday. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the funding package?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap measure through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/adelita-grijalva-arizona-mike-johnson-swearing-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:32:00.000-05:00","title":"Rep.-elect Grijalva says she plans to confront Johnson at long-delayed swearing-in ceremony","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat and newly elected representative from Arizona’s 7th district, plans to confront House Speaker Mike Johnson at her long-delayed swearing-in ceremony, which has been postponed for nearly 50 days.

They describe being beaten by guards, with some being taken to solitary confinement as punishment for protesting, and others being driven to the brink of suicide.\n \n\n   \n  The report accuses El Salvador’s prison system of systematic human rights violations and the Trump administration of complicity in torture, enforced disappearances and other violations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a CNN inquiry, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defended the administration’s decision to send the migrants to Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  “At President (Donald) Trump’s direction, DHS deported nearly 300 Tren de Aragua and MS-13 terrorists to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) Prison in El Salvador, where they no longer pose a threat to the American people,” said a statement attributed to   Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reached out to the Salvadoran presidency and the Salvadoran prisons directorate for comment. In the past, El Salvador’s government has said that it respects the human rights of people in its custody, “regardless of their nationality,” and that its prison system complies with safety and order standards.\n \n\n   \n     They ‘arrived in hell’ \n \n\n   \n  “The nightmare began the moment they took me off the plane,” the report quotes Gonzalo, a 26-year-old from Zulia, Venezuela, as saying. Gonzalo claims the migrants were beaten upon landing in El Salvador and that the mistreatment continued when they were transferred to Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  He said a prison official told them, “You have arrived in hell.”\n \n\n   \n  He and others interviewed by HRW and Cristosal alleged that guards periodically assaulted them with kicks, punches and batons during daily cell searches.\n \n\n   \n  Three of the people interviewed said they were subjected to sexual violence, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the inmates reported being humiliated by the guards, who allegedly told them they “would never get out alive,” that “nobody knew they were there,” and that “their families had abandoned them.”\n \n\n   \n  Several inmates reported having suicidal thoughts, and at least one said he attempted suicide.\n \n\n   \n  “I fell into depression. I wanted to kill myself because I thought I would be better off dead. In the end, the only thing that gave me strength was God … and my family, my wife, my daughter, and my mother,” another detainee, Nelson, says in the report.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the findings in the report match what several former detainees told CNN in late July, days after being released from Cecot and repatriated to Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Welcome to the hell of Cecot,” Venezuelan makeup artist  Andry Hernández  recalled in a CNN interview about his arrival at the Salvadoran prison.\n \n\n   \n   Jerce Reyes ,  José Mora and Rafael Martínez  all told CNN   they were frequently beaten by guards – often for disobeying the prison’s strict rules or for reasons they considered unwarranted. They also accused Salvadoran prison authorities of denying them of basic human rights, including access to attorneys and adequate living conditions.\n \n\n   \n  On a hot day, Reyes said he showered to keep cool at a time he wasn’t allowed to. The guards caught him, entered the cell, beat him up and sent him to a smaller isolated cell as punishment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Martínez alleged that he was once punished for putting his head through the cell bars when he felt sick. He said he was taken to a different cell, where about eight guards beat him and fractured his right arm.\n \n\n   \n  “(The guards) tortured us physically and psychologically,” Mora said.\n \n\n   \n  The men also spoke about going on strike to demand basic rights, including communication with the outside world. But their protests were met with a fierce response from guards, they said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we protested, they shot at us point-blank with rubber bullets, point-blank into the cell,” Mora told CNN. “We were like chickens or rats locked up … and they shot us with rubber bullets.”\n \n\n   \n     Claims of criminal involvement  \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration accused the deportees, without proof, of being linked to the Tren de Aragua criminal organization.\n \n\n   \n  Human Rights Watch and Cristosal claimed in their report that approximately half of the Venezuelans sent to Cecot had no criminal records and only 3% had been convicted in the United States for a violent or potentially violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  In its response to CNN, DHS insisted the nearly 300 detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs, saying the groups are “some of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth” and asserted that they “rape, maim, and murder for sport.”\n \n\n   \n  Reyes, Mora and Martínez said they were wrongly accused by US officials of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang and, despite their denials, were deported from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  According to records, Martínez faced robbery charges in the US, pleaded guilty, and was released on bail before being arrested and sent to a Salvadoran prison.\n \n\n   \n  Mora, meanwhile, was imprisoned in Venezuela for drug-related offenses and served his sentence.

Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Malaysia in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  hailed the declaration  as further proof of his ability to end wars but within less than a fortnight the agreement has begun fraying.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the supreme commander of Thailand’s armed forces, Gen. Ukris Boontanondha, said he was “halting all agreements until Cambodia clearly and sincerely demonstrates that it will not be ‘hostile’,” according to a Facebook post from Thailand’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sihasak Phuangketkeow said they would clarify their decision to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent major U-turn came after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand, on the volatile border with Cambodia Monday.\n \n\n   \n  One soldier’s right leg was severed in the blast, while another suffered shrapnel wounds to the leg, the army said. The incident happened while troops were on a “routine patrol along a frequently used route,” said Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army.\n \n\n   \n  After visiting the wounded soldiers near the contested border on Tuesday Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said, “Today, we consider that the agreement we had in place to move toward peace has ended.”\n \n\n   \n  “Thailand belongs to us. The ground we are standing on right now is Thailand. No one can claim sovereignty over Thai territory,” Anutin added.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand accused Cambodia of violating the joint declaration by laying fresh landmines following the removal of a barbed wire fence, which was discovered on November 9.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot independently verify the claims that Cambodian troops laid fresh landmines.\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government said in a statement it “categorically denies the allegations,” adding that it has not deployed new landmines “and will never do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia also said it is “gravely concerned” about reports that Thailand has suspended the peace declaration and it remains committed to implementing the peace accord.\n \n\n   \n  “Most minefields, from nearly three decades of Cambodia’s civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s, along the Cambodia-Thailand border have not yet been cleared due to the difficult terrains and the un-demarcated status of the border areas,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation remains calm,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson said Tuesday after military forces from both sides communicated following the landmine explosion.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Thailand also calls into question the already tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, who were scheduled to be handed over under the terms of the declaration. Thailand’s Defense Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit said the expected release would not go ahead.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile peace agreement\n \n\n   \n  In late October, Trump traveled to Malaysia as part of his three-leg tour of Asia and presided over the signing of a  peace declaration  between the leaders of Thailand Cambodia amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts in the border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was considered by Trump as a major diplomatic victory, and another fillip to his much vaunted –  and often over-exaggerated  – campaign to have ended several wars.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought brief skirmishes in recent decades over their disputed border and the fighting earlier was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had warned the two leaders that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration included a commitment to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, de-mining efforts, and to de-escalate tensions that erupted into the brief but deadly border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement was built on the truce signed in July, but fell short of a “peace treaty,” despite Trump  repeatedly describing  it as such. And  analysts had cautioned  of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.\n \n\n   \n  Anutin had qualified the signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration. And Thai diplomats were carefully reticent about the joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire  both sides agreed  to in July.\n \n\n   \n  Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia announced at the time “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of landmines along the Thai-Cambodia border has also been a major point of contention for the Thais. The most recent border flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has previously sought a ruling from the UN’s International Court of Justice over disputed areas. However, Thailand does not recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated, including the sites of several ancient temples.\n \n\n   \n  The site of the most recent landmine explosion was in an area close to Cambodia’s Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has been at the center of previous military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration did not resolve the territorial dispute over the two countries’ shared border.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/zhimin-qian-cryptocurrency-fraud-scheme-jailed-uk-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Chinese ‘cryptoqueen’ who had royal aspirations jailed in UK over $6.6 billion Bitcoin scam","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zhimin Qian, a Chinese woman known as the 'cryptoqueen', was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in the UK for operating a massive Ponzi scheme between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 people in China, resulting in the loss of approximately $6.6 billion in Bitcoin.

       10:22 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the UK, which controls a number of territories in the Caribbean where it bases intelligence assets, has helped the US locate vessels suspected of carrying drugs so that the US Coast Guard could interdict them, the sources said. That meant the ships would be stopped, boarded, its crew detained, and drugs seized.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence was typically sent to Joint Interagency Task Force South, a task force stationed in Florida that includes representatives from a number of partner nations and works to reduce the illicit drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  But shortly after the US began launching lethal strikes against the boats in September, however, the UK grew concerned that the US might use intelligence provided by the British to select targets. British officials believe the US military strikes, which have killed 76 people, violate international law, the sources said. The intelligence pause began over a month ago, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last month that the strikes violate international law and amount to “extrajudicial killing.” The UK agrees with that assessment, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The British embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official told CNN that the department “doesn’t talk about intelligence matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, Cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights — something the UK was happy to help with, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has argued that the US military can legally kill suspected traffickers because they pose an imminent threat to Americans and are “enemy combatants” who are in an “armed conflict” with the US, according to a memo sent by the administration to Congress. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel  issued an opinion , which is still classified, reinforcing that argument, CNN has reported, and Trump has designated a number of drug cartels as “foreign terrorist groups.” The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say the Law of Armed Conflict  would still apply to civilian drug traffickers , and the designation of a group as a foreign terrorist organization does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force. Several boats hit by the US have either been stationary or were turning around when they were attacked, CNN has reported, undermining the administration’s claim that they posed an imminent threat that could not be dealt with through interdiction and arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US defense officials have also expressed skepticism of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey,  offered to resign  during a tense meeting last month with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey will leave his post in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful. Hegseth’s spokesperson has previously denied that any lawyers involved in the operations have dissented.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, another key US ally which has helped the US Coast Guard interdict suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean for nearly two decades, has also distanced itself from the US military strikes. The sources told CNN that Canada intends to continue its partnership with the Coast Guard, called Operation Caribbean. But the country has made clear to the US that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Canada’s defense  told Canadian press  last month that “it is important to note that Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbean, conducted in co-ordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct” from the US military strikes on suspected drug vessels.\n \n\n   \n  Colombian President  Gustavo Petro  said Tuesday that he had similarly ordered his country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the attacks in the Caribbean stop, saying in a post on X, “The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/travel/sea-life-london-penguins-campaign-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:44:00Z","title":"Pressure grows for release of penguins ‘trapped’ at London aquarium","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing campaign led by over 70 British lawmakers, including Labour’s David Taylor and Liberal Democrat’s Danny Chambers, is demanding the relocation of 15 Gentoo penguins from a basement enclosure at the Sea Life London Aquarium, where they have been held since May 2011.

aquarium \n       \n  By Jack Guy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:44 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of British lawmakers have called for the release of 15 penguins “trapped”  at a London aquarium without access to daylight or fresh air, saying their living conditions are “utterly unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  The 15 Gentoo penguins are housed in an enclosure at the Sea Life London Aquarium, located next to the River Thames, a short distance from the Houses of Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, first opened its penguin exhibit in May 2011, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.\n \n\n   \n  Campaigners say the penguins “are a small colony, in a tiny enclosure, that does not meet their physical and social needs and does not allow them to enjoy their natural behaviours.”\n \n\n   \n  “Their enclosure offers just 6-7 feet of depth in which to dive — a pitiful fraction of the 600ft they can dive to in the wild,” animal advocates say in a petition that’s been signed by more than 37,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Now, more than 70 members of parliament have signed a letter sent to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), asking the government to “consider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioural, ecological and physiological needs,” PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The letter was coordinated by David Taylor, a lawmaker from the ruling Labour party.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s un-British to keep penguins trapped in a basement with no daylight or fresh air. No animal should live like that, with their rights appearing to be traded for hard cash,” said Taylor.\n \n\n   \n  Another signatory, Danny Chambers, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democrat party, said the penguins were kept in “utterly unacceptable” conditions.\n \n\n   \n  “They are denied fresh air, natural light and the space they need to thrive,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign to release the penguins and to cease all breeding programs at the aquarium has gained traction in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Broadcaster and environmental campaigner Chris Packham attended a protest outside the aquarium last month, calling the living conditions “completely obscene,” adding: “It must not go on.”\n \n\n   \n  “These 15 penguins are currently being housed underground with no access to daylight or fresh air in a basement that has continuously held penguins since May 2011. One penguin, Polly, has been held there for over 14 years,” said Packham in the social media post.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from the Merlin Entertainments’ Conservation, Welfare & Education team said in a statement that it had a team of specialists that ensure the penguins are “healthy and thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  The facility where the penguins are housed was designed in conjunction with vets and penguin specialists, they added, and told PA media that the facility is on the ground floor of the aquarium rather than the basement.\n \n\n   \n  “Releasing them into the wild simply isn’t a safe option for these penguins, who have always lived in human care,” said the spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a complex issue. There’s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what’s best for the animals.”\n \n\n   \n  A DEFRA spokesperson told CNN in a statement: “This government is committed to the highest standards of animal welfare. We recently launched an overhaul of welfare standards in zoos to strengthen protections and ensure all animals – including gentoo penguins – are cared for in line with best practice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/cleto-escobedo-iii-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00-05:00","title":"Cleto Escobedo III, Jimmy Kimmel’s bandleader and childhood friend, dies at 59","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleto Escobedo III, the bandleader and childhood friend of late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, died at 59.

– his show’s bandleader, Cleto Escobedo III.\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel announced Escobedo’s death Tuesday on  Instagram , saying “that we are heartbroken is an understatement.” Escobedo was 59.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other.\n \n\n   \n  “We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we’ve been pals ever since,” Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University’s Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire’s Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n \n\n   \n  “Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,” Kimmel told WABC in 2015. “And there’s nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, on Escobedo’s 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom’s car.\n \n\n   \n  “Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,” Kimmel recalled.\n \n\n   \n  News of Escobedo’s death comes after Thursday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show’s guests. The date and cause of Escobedo’s death weren’t immediately known.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.\n \n\n   \n  “Jimmy asked me, ‘Who are we going to get in the band?’ I said, ‘Well, my normal guys,’ and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I’d invite him to gigs, and if he didn’t have anything to do he’d come check it out, so he knew my guys,” Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. “Then he just said, ‘Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn’t that be kind of cool?’ I was like, ‘That would be way cool.’”\n \n\n   \n  In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.\n \n\n   \n  “Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it’s more of a young man’s game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I’ve learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they’re babies; you come back and then they’re talking, it’s like, ‘What?’” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Escobedo’s survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers,” Kimmel wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00-04:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress is moving swiftly to pass a bipartisan funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.

bill to reopen the federal government? \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:45 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Congress is  moving quickly  to pass a funding package that would end the longest federal shutdown in the nation’s history.\n \n\n   \n  The House is set to vote on Wednesday on a compromise bill after the  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the legislation extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement with Republicans does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the bill, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The bill would provide funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions would continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The legislation would fully fund the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The deal would also replenish SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund would also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year.

term order \n       \n  By John Fritze, Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:43 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended a short-term order that allows the Trump administration to withhold paying for full food stamp payments in November, a move that appeared designed to put off the case a few days in the hope that Congress approves a pending  agreement to reopen the federal government .\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving emergency appeal at the Supreme Court over Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that help more than 40 million Americans – as well as several lawsuits playing out in lower courts – would almost certainly be dismissed as moot if the historic shutdown ends in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  But until that happens, the “administrative stay” that  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued Friday  will continue to block a lower court order that required the administration to provide full federal food benefits.\n \n\n   \n  In a new brief order on Tuesday, the court said it was extending the administrative stay through the end of the day Thursday. Jackson dissented from the extension.\n \n\n   \n  Along with canceled flights, the spiraling legal battle over food stamps became a defining and tangible impact of the shutdown. The groups challenging the administration told the Supreme Court in a brief earlier Tuesday that SNAP beneficiaries had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food” and that millions of Americans, including children, were going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps on a staggered basis throughout each month. Nearly 27 million should have gotten their allotments by Monday, according to estimates by Code for America, which works with governments to improve access to safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive around $350, on average, each month to help them buy food, though for many families, the assistance is spent quickly.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration countered that a lower court that ordered full SNAP payments was out of line, requiring the US Department of Agriculture to transfer about $4 billion out of one fund and into another. And, the Justice Department warned, the lower court orders on food aid “inject the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Under a separate court order that was not before the Supreme Court, the administration relied on contingency funds to pay partial food stamp benefits for November. The question before the Supreme Court, then, was whether the administration could be required to pay the full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the multiple and varied USDA guidance memos to states stemming from the court actions, a number of states sent either full or partial November benefits to their residents. At least 16 states have provided beneficiaries with their full allotments for the month, and another five states have sent partial payments, according to a CNN tally.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in government funding.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The nonprofit groups challenging President Donald Trump raced back to US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island last week to argue that the court should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. The administration quickly appealed to the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, who handles emergency appeals from the 1st Circuit, issued what’s known as an “administrative stay” on Friday, effectively putting McConnell’s order on hold for a few days so lower courts could review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s emergency order was set to expire a few minutes before midnight on Tuesday. The justice did not explain her decision to dissent from the court’s extension.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/marion-county-record-raid-search","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-05:00","title":"A Kansas County Agrees to Pay $3 Million and Apologize for Raid on Small-Town Newspaper","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marion County, Kansas, has agreed to pay $3 million and issue a public apology for a 2023 raid on the Marion County Record, a small-town newspaper, which involved the seizure of reporters’ phones and computers and the search of the publisher’s and a councilwoman’s homes.

Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  One lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  A second lawsuit was filed by the family of 8-year-old Eloise “Lulu” Peck.\n \n\n   \n  A third was filed by the family of  9-year-old Ellen Getten .\n \n\n   \n  And a fourth was filed by the families of six other campers: Virginia Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane Hunt, Lucy Dillon and Kellyanne Lytal.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants in each lawsuit include Camp Mystic and members of the Eastland family, which owns the 99-year-old camp in Kerr County.\n \n\n   \n   “ Tragically, due to lack of planning, the absence of any evacuation plans, lack of training, inadequate warning systems, and other acts and omissions of recklessness and gross negligence, Plaintiffs’ daughters suffered terrifying, brutal, and horrific deaths,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.\n \n\n   \n  While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the lawsuits allege\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors claims Camp Mystic didn’t have adequate safety plans and prioritized money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.”\n \n\n   \n  On the morning of July 4, “the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp “chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp,” it continued. “Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  Another lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at  Bubble Inn cabin .\n \n\n   \n  The camp’s directors should have known about emergency alerts in the area before the calamitous flooding and should have been on “high alert,” the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  But there was no plan to evacuate campers until 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” the third lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of six girls slammed “Camp Mystic’s so-called ‘Emergency Instructions.’” A wrinkled copy of those instructions was found in a counselor’s flooded trunk.\n \n\n   \n  Under the “Floods” section, the instructions say “Campers and counselors NEVER wander away from your cabin” and “All cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”\n \n\n   \n  “Tragically, the last two sentences of Camp Mystic’s instructions caused the loss of Plaintiffs’ children’s lives,” that lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence. Further, to state that ‘[a]ll cabins are constructed on high, safe ground’ was patently false, misleading [and] created a false sense of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  Photos from inside one cabin show “the water rose so close to the ceiling (5 ¾ inches) [that] the girls ran out of air space and were tragically swept into the raging flood waters,” the lawsuit states. Eight-year-old Lucy “did not make it out of the cabin where she lost her life.”\n \n\n   \n  All four lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court and compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n  The first three lawsuits each seek more than $1 million in damages. The fourth suit does not specify an amount.\n \n\n   \n    The camp responds\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n  The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said, noting camp leaders helped evacuate 166 girls.\n \n\n   \n  But a photo in the lawsuit filed by the six families – which attorneys say was timestamped at 3:26 a.m. – showed some campers wading in floodwater to get to higher ground.\n \n\n   \n  Watts challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  next summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  The news stunned Steward, who still doesn’t know where her daughter is.\n \n\n   \n  “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter’s body,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/fda-cder-pazdur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:24:00-05:00","title":"Longtime FDA oncology leader named agency’s top drug regulator","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has appointed Dr. Richard Pazdur, a longtime oncology expert, as the new head of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the division responsible for regulating most prescription drugs and over-the-counter products.

I think it’s so demeaning, and I think it hurts the game. It hurts the pageantry. I’ve told that to Roger Goodell, and I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other, and … it’s the opposite of what the game (is supposed to be). The ball is in the air, and nobody’s moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to move.\n \n\n   \n  “You walk in and the pageantry of the game is so badly hurt. And I don’t think NFL, you know, they don’t, they do what they want to do, but I don’t think they’ll change.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been a frequent critic of the NFL’s revamped kickoff format, adopted for the first time last season in an effort to decrease the intense collisions that frequently resulted in injuries.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the league for comment on Trump’s latest criticism on the so-called dynamic kickoff.\n \n\n   \n  Under the old rules, the kicking team started at its 35-yard line and tried to kick the ball as far downfield as possible to give their defense a better chance of stopping the offense far from the end zone. Meanwhile, the receiving team tries to move the ball as far as they can up the field. With two teams running at each other at top speed, collisions between players were often devastating.\n \n\n   \n  The new version still sees the ball kicked from the kicking team’s 35-yard line, but every player on the kicking team other than the kicker himself now lines up with at least one foot on the returning team’s 40-yard line.\n \n\n   \n  Players must also wait to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20-yard line. Any kick that is caught or lands in the landing zone must be returned, while any kick that falls short of the landing zone will be ruled a touchback and spotted at the returning team’s 40-yard line. If a kick hits the landing zone and then goes into the end zone, it has to be returned or downed by the receiving team.\n \n\n   \n  Among other things, it basically means players are closer together and are not colliding into each other with as much speed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has complained about the rule almost since it first debuted. But on Tuesday, he went even further with his lamentations.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope college football doesn’t change, because the power of the kickoff is, we’re so beautiful, and now it, you know, I don’t want to say what it reminds me of, because I’ll get myself into big trouble,” Trump said. “It is not football, and I have no idea what you guys – you guys may disagree with me. I don’t think it’s going to help.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so bad. It’s so bad. It’s so unromantic, and it just is demeaning to football. I don’t think they have a right to do that to the game,” Trump went on to say. “You know, the game is so important. I don’t think the people that approve that. I don’t think anybody has the right to do that to the game. And I hope college doesn’t change, and I hope that someday the NFL will stop it and go back to football.”\n \n\n   \n  The league has maintained that the new system is safer than the old and also results in more exciting plays.\n \n\n   \n  Kickoffs have long been one of the most dangerous plays in the game and were four times more likely to cause a concussion than a play that involved running or passing, according to  data  from the NFL. Since the change in format, the league has been buoyed by the early results.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the NFL  published data  from the 2024 season that showed a “significant decrease in concussions.” As intended, the new rule slowed average player speeds, which led to a lower concussion rate – down 43% from 2021-2023.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL said returns increased 57% in the 2024 regular season and that there were seven kickoffs returned for touchdowns – the most since 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, told CNN that the new rule makes the game safer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been an overwhelming success,” Sills said.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Last year, if you look at our data, significantly higher return rate but the injury rate was one of the lowest that we’ve seen. So, that was what we were looking for with the play, is to make it more exciting yet also safer. So, we looked at space and speed. It went down, which is what we expected from the play. We, again, saw more excitement. And here’s an unexpected benefit: Because the average starting point for drives was further out, closer to the 30-yard line, we had fewer punts, which is also good from a health and safety standpoint because pun is one of our more injurious plays.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/nba-mavericks-nico-harrison-fans","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Mavs fans wanted Nico Harrison fired.

Harrison fired. Now that he’s gone, they say it’s only the beginning \n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Dallas Mavericks f ired general manager Nico Harrison on Tuesday , marking the end of a turbulent tenure defined by bold moves, fan unrest, and a season that  spiraled after the controversial Luka Dončić trade. \n \n\n   \n  For much of the fan base, the decision brought relief – but not necessarily satisfaction.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Still apathetic’ \n \n\n   \n  Matthew Slovak, a long-time Mavs fan,  said the move felt inevitable. \n \n\n   \n  “Still apathetic about the team. Every Mavs fan knew the moment the trade happened that Nico would eventually be fired,” he said. “This still does not change that (owner Patrick) Dumont knows nothing about basketball. … Unless they bring Dirk (Nowitski, a franchise legend) back into the fold with an official position, preferably general manager, I will have no faith in Dumont or who he hires to make good decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Slovak’s frustration runs deeper than Harrison’s front-office record. He blamed ownership – the Dumonts and the Adelsons — for what he sees as a series of tone-deaf decisions that alienated fans.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s close to impossible to root for an organization that they own,” he said, adding that the only thing keeping him invested is  the potential of phenom Cooper Flagg. \n \n\n   \n     Hope and heartbreak \n \n\n   \n  For Skylar Alcala, who adored Dončić when he played on the Mavs, the firing brought an emotional mix of relief and lingering pain.\n \n\n   \n  “First initial reaction, THANK THE LORD!” she said. “With how the Mavs have started this season, I’m glad Dumont realized that what Nico did to this team was detrimental.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Alcala said the damage runs deep.\n \n\n   \n  “The way I feel about the Mavs now is still heartbreak. … There’s definitely a slight weight lifted off my shoulders knowing Nico is gone, but the Mavs organization has a-ways to go to build back trust,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  And the Dončić trade still stings: “The hardest part in all of this is seeing Luka dominate for the Lakers while we watch and wish every day for him to be back in a Mavs uniform.”\n \n\n   \n     A chance to heal – and rebuild \n \n\n   \n  John Tarrant – who, despite the Dončić trade, continued to cheer for the team and brings his sons to games – called the move long overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about time. The only person upset is Jerry Jones because he’s no longer the second-worst respected GM in DFW,” he quipped. “This organization and fan base needs to heal, and this is a first step.”\n \n\n   \n  Tarrant said fans are ready to move forward and build around young star Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  “Next steps need to happen. Anyone associated with Harrison’s tenure – including Anthony Davis – needs to be moved. Let’s rebuild this from the ground up around Flagg,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, he couldn’t hide his frustration at the trade that defined Harrison’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  “To trade a 25-year-old superstar for an injury-prone, aging veteran who has only played 14 of 46 games still makes zero sense,” Tarrant said. “Can Cuban buy back the team?”\n \n\n   \n     The bottom line \n \n\n   \n  The firing of Harrison may close one painful chapter, but the Mavericks’ front office faces immense pressure to get the next one right. Fans have made it clear: firing Harrison was a start – not a solution.\n \n\n   \n  As Slovak put it, “It’s not impossible to salvage the situation, but there’s been no indication over the last year that leadership is capable of making the decisions required to bring back the fans.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/how-to-help-food-insecurity-iyw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00-05:00","title":"How to Help Those Facing Food Insecurity","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, delays in SNAP benefits are causing widespread food insecurity among approximately 42 million Americans, with particularly severe impacts on low-income older adults.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Democrats’  intraparty feud  is making its way to the House, where members of the caucus are hoping to soundly reject the deal  moderate Senate Democrats  reached with Republicans to reopen the government during a vote later this week.\n \n\n   \n  Navigating the party’s shutdown strategy will be particularly delicate for the 13 Democrats in seats that went for President Donald Trump last year. At a time when the party base has lambasted Senate Democrats, who have been accused of “caving” to end the  weekslong shutdown , most of those to speak out have rejected the Senate deal.\n \n\n   \n  The  deal to end the shutdown  would fund the government through the end of January and offer a reprieve from layoffs for federal workers. Under the agreement, the Senate plans to vote on legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, Democrats’ main funding priority. The deal does not, however, guarantee a vote will happen in the House, which has become the main sticking point for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “If we knew we were going to get a vote in the House, I’d probably support this deal,” New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose district went for Trump by 5 points last year, said during a  radio interview  with Brian Lehrer on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leadership is encouraging members to vote against the Senate deal,  CNN has reported , and one centrist coalition within the party also opposes the agreement. The moderate New Democrat Coalition on Tuesday came out against the deal, a position that required approval from two-thirds of the group’s 116 members. Ten of the 13 Democrats in Trump districts are members of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what the 13 crossover district Democrats — based on lines drawn before  this year’s redistricting battles  — have said about the deal to end the government shutdown:\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Josh Harder of California\n \n\n   \n  Harder said he is a “hell no” on the deal in  an X video  his office posted Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t a deal at all,” he said. “It’s a surrender that is doing absolutely nothing to lower health care costs and premiums for millions of Californians.”\n \n\n   \n  Harder blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats who voted for the deal, calling it an “unacceptable” capitulation to the Trump administration, and said he would push to stop it in the House. Schumer publicly opposed the deal and voted against it.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York\n \n\n   \n  Suozzi told WNYC on Monday he wasn’t ready to endorse the Senate deal because it doesn’t guarantee a vote in the House to address the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. Like many Democrats opposed to the funding bill, Suozzi said he was worried the Senate might pass a measure to address the expiring tax credits, only for the House not to take it up.\n \n\n   \n  “That would be a real kick in the head,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Nellie Pou of New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Pou called the agreement a “bad deal” in  a statement on X  and said she would oppose any measure that doesn’t extend the premium tax credits.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be voting no to any so-called government funding package that will not stop Republican price hikes on health care premiums,” Pou said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan\n \n\n   \n  McDonald Rivet said she’s opposed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently need a bipartisan budget with real solutions to fix these costs and open the government,” she  said in a statement on X . “I remain ready to work on it, but caving without health care solutions would fail countless working families who are struggling to get by.”\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio\n \n\n   \n  The Ohio lawmaker  told Spectrum News  that she will not vote for the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s at stake are the health insurance bills and the cost of health insurance for millions and millions of Americans and their families, and we cannot take their benefits away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    The other lawmakers\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina  wrote on X  that he is reviewing the deal and is focused on “ending the government shutdown responsibly and addressing the high cost of living families are facing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat, expressed concerns about the funding bill  to a local ABC affiliate , saying the deal “doesn’t get anywhere close” to resolving premium increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t help to fix the health care crisis that we are facing, not just in New Mexico but across the country,” Vasquez said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to spokespeople for Reps.

investigating a  multistate outbreak of infant botulism  that may be tied to ByHeart’s “whole nutrition” infant formula products.\n \n\n   \n  Epidemiologic and laboratory data has shown that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, the germ that causes botulism, the FDA said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  According to the FDA, as of Monday, 15 children with suspected or confirmed infant botulism who had also been exposed to ByHeart infant formula have been  reported in 12 states : Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  All 15 infants, who ranged in age from 16 days to 157 days, were hospitalized and given  BabyBIG , an intravenous antibody treatment for infant botulism. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism happens when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum   spores, which can grow in the gut and produce botulinum neurotoxin,  according to the CDC . Signs and symptoms – which can take several weeks to develop – may include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing and a weak and altered cry, which can progress to difficulty breathing and respiratory arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Since August, 84 infants have received treatment for infant botulism nationwide, based on data from the California Department of Public Health’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, according to the FDA. Among those infants, 43% had been exposed to powdered infant formula. And among those who had powdered infant formula exposure, more than 40% consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula.\n \n\n   \n  “This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,” according to the  FDA . “Investigations remain ongoing but have not identified any other infant formula brands or shared exposures that pose a risk to infants.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘All ByHeart product must be discarded’\n \n\n   \n  Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the co-founders of ByHeart,  said in an online letter  Tuesday that they have provided the FDA with access to all of their facilities and products.\n \n\n   \n  “Upon learning about this outbreak on Friday evening, we immediately began conducting our own extensive testing on all ByHeart batches. Additionally, we are providing the FDA complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation, which has been done regularly at our owned facilities. We will share the results of our own testing as they become available,” Funt and Belldegrun wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “At this moment, the most important thing for you to know is that all ByHeart product must be discarded. We know that switching formulas is not an easy process or decision. We have resources to help,” they said, providing a link to a guide on  how to switch infant formulas . “We are so sorry, and are committed to doing anything we can to support you.”\n \n\n   \n  Several states are testing leftover formula, the FDA said, and the results are expected in the coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n   Preliminary lab results  that the California Department of Public Health released Saturday suggested that the bacterium that causes botulism was present in an open can of ByHeart infant formula, which was fed to an infant with botulism.\n \n\n   \n  “Infant botulism is a very rare disease that occurs when babies inhale or swallow spores of the toxin-producing bacteria that cause infant botulism, which leads to progressive muscle weakness including trouble breathing if not treated in time,” Dr. Erica Pan, California Department of Public Health’s director and state public health officer,  said in a news release  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have tested a sample of the specific powdered infant formula linked with these cases and preliminary tests are positive,” Pan said. “We are urging parents to stop using ByHeart formula immediately.”​\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive for Clostridium botulinum spores or toxin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:35:00Z","title":"Former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik to Face Probe Over Online Comments About Rival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is facing an investigation by FIDE over repeated, unsubstantiated accusations of cheating against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died unexpectedly at age 29.

\n  Former world  chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment over his comments about a rival,  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00Z","title":"Dow Soars More Than 550 Points as Wall Street Embraces Optimism That Government Might Reopen Soon","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 559 points to a record high of 47,927.96 on Tuesday, driven by optimism that the U.S. government shutdown would end by the end of the week.

On  Tuesday , the US Navy announced the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford – America’s largest warship – had arrived in the US Southern Command area of operations, which includes most of Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the Ford to make its way to the Caribbean from Europe late last month.\n \n\n   \n  The strike group accompanying the Ford brings with it nine air squadrons, two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers – the USS Bainbridge and USS Mahan – the integrated air and missile defense command ship USS Winston S. Churchill, and more than 4,000 sailors.\n \n\n   \n  The US has framed its build-up of forces in the region as aimed at combating drug trafficking and the flow of drugs into the United States, and has  carried out strikes  on numerous alleged drug boats in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  However, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change and some Trump administration officials have  privately conceded  their strategy is aimed at removing Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Trump said he had  authorized the CIA  to operate in Venezuela and he has previously suggested he was weighing the possibility of strikes inside the country – though administration officials have since said the US is not currently planning such action.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement Tuesday, Padrino López framed the deployment of the Venezuelan forces as part of Maduro’s wider “Independence Plan 200” – a civic-military strategy aimed at mobilizing conventional military forces alongside militia and police forces to defend the country.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, has some 123,000 members. Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   \n  With the arrival of the Ford, there are thought to be roughly 15,000 US personnel in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets were already in the region before the arrival of the Ford group, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean. The US has also deployed at least three MQ-9 reaper drones to the island, according to images captured by Reuters in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Alongside the hardware, there are thought to be around 5,000 US troops in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n  US bombers have also flown several training missions near the Venezuelan coast, including a bomber “ attack demonstration ” in late October.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/europe/serbia-protest-kushner-real-estate-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:00","title":"Serbian Protesters Vow to Prevent Real Estate Project Linked to Trump Son-in-Law Kushner","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Serbian protesters, led by youth, have formed a human shield around a bombed-out military complex in Belgrade to prevent its redevelopment into a luxury compound by Affinity Global Development, a company linked to Jared Kushner, son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump.

symbolically formed a human shield Tuesday around a bombed-out military complex, vowing to protect it from redevelopment as a luxury compound by a company linked to US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n \n\n   \n  Youth-led protesters drew a red line as they encircled the sprawling buildings in the capital, Belgrade that were partially destroyed in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign. The site faces demolition and redevelopment under a plan backed by the populist government of  President Aleksandar Vucic .\n \n\n   \n  The $500-million project to build a high-rise hotel, offices and shops at the site has met fierce opposition from experts at home and abroad, as well as the Serbian public. But last week Serbian lawmakers passed a special law clearing the way for the construction despite legal hurdles.\n \n\n   \n  Vucic’s pro-Trump government says the project would boost the economy and ties with the US administration, which has imposed tariffs of 35% on imports from Serbia. It has also sanctioned Serbia’s monopoly oil supplier, which is controlled by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, critics say the building is an architectural monument, seen as a symbol of resistance to the US-led NATO bombing that remains widely viewed in the Balkan country as an unjust “aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Serbia’s government last year stripped the complex of protected status and signed a 99-year-lease agreement with Kushner-related Affinity Global Development in the US. But the redevelopment project came into question after Serbia’s organized crime prosecutors launched an investigation into whether documents used to remove that status were forged.\n \n\n   \n  The buildings are seen as prime examples of mid-20th century architecture in the former Yugoslavia. The protesters demanded that the protected heritage status for the complex be restored, and the buildings rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a warning that we will all defend these buildings together,” one of the students said. “We will be the human shield.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue has become the latest flashpoint in yearlong street protests that have shaken Vucic’s firm grip on power. Protesters have accused his government of rampant corruption in state projects. The protests started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad after renovation, killing 16 people.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of people marked the tragedy’s anniversary on Nov. 1 in Novi Sad.\n \n\n   \n  Serbia was bombed in 1999 for 78 days to force then-President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Anti-NATO sentiment remain strong in Serbia, and the US role in revamping the military buildings is particularly sensitive among many Serbians.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the government in Albania, another Balkan country, approved a $1.6 billion plan from Kushner’s company for a project to develop a luxury resort on a communist-era fortified island on the Adriatic coast.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"India on edge after deadly car explosion in capital region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car explosion occurred in Delhi’s historic Red Fort area on November 11, 2025, killing at least 10 people and injuring over 30.

The JuA has been behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan in the past decade. However, the TTP distanced itself from the attack, according to the group’s spokesman Mohammad Khurasani.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s president Asif Ali Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide blast” near the city’s High Court on Tuesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Islamabad requires a high level of security to enter and exit the city with specific security zones throughout the capital. The explosion took place in the parking lot of the city’s busy judicial complex in a district full of high-ranking government offices.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities located CCTV footage showing a man loitering around the courts having attempted to enter the building – before carrying out the attack, according to Mohsin Naqvi, the Pakistani interior minister.\n \n\n   \n  “He was waiting, but when the police car approached that’s when he carried out the attack,” Naqvi told reporters on Tuesday. “Everyone who enters the court is checked by security and since he was unable to do so, he attacked the police car. We have all the CCTV footage.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the   deadliest suicide attack in the Pakistani capital in close to two decades. The last major attack was in 2008 when a suicide attack by a militant Islamist group at the city’s Marriott hotel killed 54 people.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in Islamist violence since the Afghan Taliban swept Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  Without providing evidence, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif foisted blame upon “Indian terrorist proxies” on Tuesday, claiming that other recent militant attacks in the country were “being carried out from Afghan soil and backed by India.”\n \n\n   \n  Delhi rejected “the baseless and unfounded allegations” in a statement on Tuesday, accusing Islamabad of fomenting “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India in order to deflect the attention of its own public from the ongoing military-inspired constitutional subversion and power-grab unfolding within the country,” added India’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  The comments come months after India and Pakistan engaged in the most intense fighting in decades, which saw four days of escalating conflict in May that included fighter jets, missiles, and drones packed with explosives.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I saw 40 people fall immediately’\n \n\n   \n  Manzar Abbas lay on a red and white hospital bed in Islamabad on Tuesday, his bloodied leg strapped with a thick bandage.\n \n\n   \n  The 32-year-old PhD student was near a police station close to the courts, when tens of residents immediately hit the ground following the blast. Then, in a split second, a security guard helped him get to hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was passing the police station close to the courts, I saw the police car pass me and I saw a man go towards it wearing his jacket,” Abbas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw about 40 people fall immediately,” he added. “I had been hit as well and bled a lot. But thank goodness I was saved.”\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif stated on X that Pakistan is in a “state of war” and that this attack should be taken as a “wake-up call” with regards to negotiations with neighboring Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “The rulers of Kabul can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which—praise be to God—Pakistan has the full strength to respond,” the Pakistani defense minister added.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement expressing “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding both the attack in Islamabad as well as the attack on the cadet college in the country’s northwest. The statement from Afghanistan did not address the remarks of Pakistan’s defence minister.\n \n\n   \n  Both the embassies of China and the United States condemned the attack. The US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said in a statement that “the United States stands in solidarity with Pakistan in the struggle against terrorism.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his condolences to the victims’ families and called for a full investigation, his spokesman said.\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between the Pakistani and Afghan militaries in October saw the worst violence between the two countries in years.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to maintain a ceasefire fell apart when peace talks between the two neighbors failed in Istanbul last week following the failure to establish a long-term deal regarding hostile militant groups in Afghanistan that operate against Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion came  less than a day after militants attacked a cadet college in northwestern Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/secret-lives-mormon-wives-season-3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Strap in because ‘The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ is bringing even more drama this season","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The third season of 'The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' returns with heightened drama, centering on revelations from cast members like Taylor Frankie Paul and Jessi Ngatikaura, who faced scandals involving infidelity and 'soft swinging' within their religious community.

heating up again in Utah.\n \n\n   \n  “The  Secret Lives of Mormon Wives ” is returning for its third season, which unfolds in some different locations (no spoilers here) but lacks absolutely no drama as the women try to balance personal relationships, work opportunities and the unique dynamics of being reality stars.\n \n\n   \n  The series began in 2024 thanks to Taylor Frankie Paul, who found scandal in 2022, when she announced via TikTok that she was getting divorced after she said she violated the terms of her open marriage. She also shared that she and her now ex-husband Tate had participated in “soft swinging” with other couples in their Utah community, which involved trading sexual partners in their social circle.\n \n\n   \n  Paul is credited with forming “MomTok” by pulling together a group of fellow Mormon mothers on TikTok. Many of the members have millions of followers, sharing glimpses into their lives for lucrative sponsorships.\n \n\n   \n  The first season of “Mormon Wives” last year focused on the fallout from Paul’s scandalous revelation, as well as her subsequent pregnancy with boyfriend Dakota Mortensen, with whom she became involved while married.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward Season 3, and lots has changed as viewers witnessed the toxicity between Paul and Mortensen over the past two seasons and the recent announcement that she  is the next Bachelorette. \n \n\n   \n  Paul’s fellow cast members Layla Taylor and Miranda McWhorter offered support in her attempt to find love on another reality show.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Taylor deserves to find an actual pure example of love in somebody that respects her in and out of the room that she’s in,” Taylor said. “I feel like Taylor’s (Frankie Paul) just deserving of that. So we’re excited. We’re so excited.”\n \n\n   \n  McWhorter agreed, which means something as she and her now ex-husband Chase were a big part of the “soft swinging” scandal that kicked the show off. She told CNN, “You gotta be okay with whatever skeletons you got in that closet coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have to authentic and open and real about everything. I think the more reserved you are this might not be for you. And it’s hard,” McWhorter said. “This is a hard world to be in. You have people that are judging you off of how you handle situations, off of how you operate. And it’s hard because people are only seeing such small glimpses into who you are as a person.”\n \n\n   \n  New “Bachelorette” Paul is not the only one who has gotten a reality crossover.\n \n\n   \n  Cast members Jennifer Affleck and Whitney Leavitt were selected to compete on the most recent season of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck spoke with CNN soon after she was eliminated from the dance competition.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely a different vibe and it’s a different hard because with the ‘Secret Lives’ it can be very draining in the sense that there’s a lot of drama and it’s uncomfortable in that sense,” Affleck said. “But ‘Dancing With the Stars’ is uncomfortable in the sense that it’s not only mentally demanding, but also it’s very physical.”\n \n\n   \n  She said she loved how positive “DWTS” was because “everyone tries to stray away from drama and that was kind of nice for me to be able to be on a reality TV show that doesn’t fixate on drama.”\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 also includes the heightened drama of finding out what really happened regarding allegations of Jessi Ngatikaura being unfaithful to her husband and the unraveling of her and some of the other women’s relationship with Demi Engemann, who has had tension with more than a few of them.\n \n\n   \n  Ngatikaura admitted to having “all the emotions” about her personal life playing out on air.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m nervous clearly, because it’s a big story to share and I have no idea what the opinions will be,” she told CNN. “But I’m also relieved that it’ll be out there because it’s kind of been like a secret and no one’s known my dynamic and what happened in my relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  “So at least it’ll be out there and I can talk about it openly, but I have no idea what the audience is going to feel,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” debuts Thursday on Hulu.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/europe/british-journalist-hamdi-ice-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:45:00-05:00","title":"British Journalist Sami Hamdi Expected to Be Released from ICE Detention and Return to UK","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, known for his analysis of Middle Eastern conflicts, was detained by US immigration authorities (ICE) on October 26, 2025, following a speaking event in California.

flailing on the economy is worse than Biden’s \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:17 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  recent commentary on the economy is drawing plenty of comparisons to then-President Joe Biden’s.\n \n\n   \n  In his most dismissive remarks on the topic to date, Trump ratcheted up his downplaying of Americans’ affordability concerns in a  Fox News interview  on Monday. He even called them a “con job by Democrats” and said the “polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Biden and his administration made a series of wayward predictions and comments about just how significant a problem inflation would prove to be. And they wound up paying a significant political price for their economic Pollyanna act.\n \n\n   \n  But the situations aren’t that analogous.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump has gone much further in his attempts to bury his head in the sand. And he seems to have a bigger problem politically speaking, for several reasons.\n \n\n   \n  No, the economy isn’t necessarily worse under Trump than it was under Biden. But Trump seems to have turned it into a bigger political liability.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration’s sins on this front were largely in its failure to recognize or convey how stubborn a problem inflation would be. Administration officials repeatedly and infamously used words like “transitory,” suggesting the problem would soon go away.\n \n\n   \n  “We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we’ve seen some price increases,” Biden  said in July 2021 . “Some folks have raised worries that could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that’s not our view.”\n \n\n   \n  Their view was wrong. The annual inflation rate climbed from about 5% when Biden made those remarks all the way over 9% about a year later. In the intervening months, the administration effectively  acknowledged its error .\n \n\n   \n  Trump, by contrast, isn’t just downplaying inflation or donning glasses that seem a couple of shades too rosy; he’s pretending the problem simply doesn’t exist.\n \n\n   \n  That escalated Monday when he was pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether Americans were right to be feeling the economic pinch. Trump basically suggested it was much ado about nothing.\n \n\n   \n  “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When Ingraham pointed to polls that show Americans are quite anxious about the economy, the president responded: “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote a good rundown Monday of Trump’s  nonstop string of lies  about this subject – lies that he repeated in the same Fox interview even as he accused others of misinformation. Trump has misstated a bevy of economic data points, including on inflation, grocery prices, energy prices and prescription drug prices. He keeps saying things like that there is no inflation or that grocery prices are down.\n \n\n   \n  (Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, claimed Monday when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that Trump merely meant  inflation  was down, rather than prices. But that’s not what Trump has said. And as Dale notes, inflation is not down.)\n \n\n   \n  Biden’s gamble was that his and his administration’s predictions could turn out to be wrong, which they did.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s gamble is that if he can’t convince people of his alternate version of reality, he risks looking completely out of touch.\n \n\n   \n  Which brings us to the other major difference with Biden.\n \n\n   \n  There is no question that inflation and the economy were political problems for the Democratic president; they likely helped deliver Trump the White House in 2024. But they appear to be even bigger political problems for Trump now.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are more likely to tie economic problems to Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  A number of recent polls have shown this:\n \n\n   \n  And despite Trump’s and his administration’s attempts to blame Biden for continuing economic pains, polls suggest Americans aren’t about to buy into that.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll  as far back as May showed that if the country were to fall into a recession, 59% of Americans would blame Trump, versus just 37% who would blame Biden.\n \n\n   \n  So why might Americans be more likely to attach economic pains to Trump than they did to Biden?\n \n\n   \n  There are a number of possible reasons.\n \n\n   \n  One is that Trump  pledged over and over to bring prices down quickly , and he clearly hasn’t done that.\n \n\n   \n  Another is that Biden might have benefited from Americans blaming at least some of the economic problems on the Covid-19 pandemic – which rocked the economy worldwide – rather than his policies.\n \n\n   \n  Another could be that Trump voluntarily took ownership of an already dicey economy by launching tariffs very early in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  But arguably the biggest reason is that Americans just haven’t seen Trump take on this issue head-on. CBS polling shows as many 75% of Americans say the Trump administration has focused “not enough” on lowering prices. That includes 57% of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  (At least Biden was doing things like getting Congress to pass a bill called the “Inflation Reduction Act” – regardless of whether it actually helped with inflation.)\n \n\n   \n  One way for Trump to respond to this data would be to double down on making affordability his focus. Another is to pretend 75% of Americans simply don’t know what they’re talking about or that the number is “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has apparently chosen the latter. It’s difficult to see how those around him would see it as their best option.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/weather/arctic-blast-chicago-snow-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00-05:00","title":"Record-breaking cold settles in across the southern US, but another big change is coming","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record-breaking cold snap swept through the southern U.S. on November 11, 2025, with temperatures dropping as far south as Miami, Fort Myers, and Naples, Florida, where cities like Jacksonville and Savannah recorded their coldest November 11 temperatures since 1976.

Waxman, Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Record cold temperatures have pushed as far south as Florida this morning as wind-whipped snow continues to pile up in the eastern Great Lakes from a brief bout of Arctic air gripping the eastern US.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen cities, reaching as far south as Fort Myers, Miami and Naples, Florida, toppled or tied daily record lows for November 11.\n \n\n   \n  This morning is the coldest so early in the fall since 1976 in Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, with both locations dropping to a shivering 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The cold is causing South Florida’s cold-blooded iguanas to “freeze,” or lose muscle control. They can sometimes fall out of trees as a result, which some Floridians saw Tuesday morning. The iguanas are not dead, but rather in a paralyzed state and can revive if temperatures warm up fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  Cold conditions farther north have kicked the lake-effect snow machine into gear across the Great Lakes for the first time this year. Snow will contribute to dangerous travel conditions on Tuesday in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest snow has come to an end in the western Great Lakes. Up to a foot of snow fell more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  Chicago only picked up 1 to 3 inches of snow, which was accompanied by thunder and strong winds Sunday night into early Monday. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potentially historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are. That’s what happened Monday near Lake Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, over a foot of snow fell in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Several inches of snow have also piled up in the Appalachians from West Virginia to the border between North Carolina and Tennessee since Monday. Knoxville, Tennessee, saw its earliest accumulating snow since 1996 on Monday,  according to the National Weather Service . Snowflakes have flown through the air as far south as the Atlanta metro area on Monday, and along the North Carolina coast in Wilmington on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n    A temperature turnaround is ahead\n \n\n   \n  The good news: This cold snap won’t stick around long.\n \n\n   \n  Temperatures across the central and southern US will rebound quickly in the second half of this week as Arctic air releases its grip and warmer winds from out of the south return. Highs will be as much as 10 to 25 degrees above average from the Plains into the Midwest by Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A few cities in the Midwest that just saw their first snowflakes of the season could flirt with daily record high temperatures on Saturday. That includes Dubuque, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois, where thermometers are predicted to climb to near 70 degrees as the weekend begins.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the South will also return to shorts and T-shirt weather in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Highs in the lower 70s return to Nashville, Tennessee, by Friday, which is about 10 degrees above average. Much of the Florida Peninsula will see thermometers reach the upper 70s and lower 80s heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone in the East will feel this warmup. Temperatures in much of the Northeast are predicted to remain stubbornly cooler than average through the end of the week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/basketball-nba-dallas-mavericks-fire-embattled-gm","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:33:00-05:00","title":"Dallas Mavericks Fire General Manager Nico Harrison After Fan Outrage Over Luka Dončić Trade","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dallas Mavericks have fired general manager Nico Harrison after months of intense fan backlash over the February 2025 trade that sent star player Luka Dončić to the Lakers.

Harrison became something akin to Public Enemy No. 1 in Dallas, even after lucking into the top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft and drafting Duke star Cooper Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to fans, owner Patrick Dumont said the current state of the organization is not in line with the expectations fans have set for the Mavs.\n \n\n   \n  “No one associated with the Mavericks organization is happy with the start of what we all believed would be a promising season,” Dumont wrote. “You have high expectations for the Mavericks, and I share them with you. When the results don’t meet expectations, it’s my responsibility to act. I’ve made the decision to part ways with General Manager Nico Harrison.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “I know our players are deeply committed to a winning culture, this decision was critical to moving our franchise forward in a positive direction.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization announced Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi will serve as co-interim general managers while a permanent replacement is sought.\n \n\n   \n  The Dončić trade ended up ushering in one of the bleakest stretches for any NBA team in recent memory.  On February 1,  the Mavericks sent Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers’ 2029 first-round draft pick.\n \n\n   \n   In the period after the deal , the Mavericks went 14-21, lost Anthony Davis – the main player Dallas received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. Davis returned as the Mavs tried to win a spot in the NBA playoffs through the play-in round but ultimately fell short.\n \n\n   \n  During that entire time, the fans demanded Harrison be fired and pundits declared that the Mavericks had just made a potentially franchise killing move. Dončić is just 26 years old, led the team to the NBA Finals in the 2023-24 season, had been named All-NBA each year he had been in the league and was entering his prime. All reporting around the deal indicated that Dončić never planned to leave Dallas, and his emotional return to Texas in  April indicated that the pain of the surprise move still pained him.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old  told ESPN  that he threw and cracked his phone when he first heard about the trade, adding that he felt “sadness mostly” and that he “felt like my heart was broken, honestly.”\n \n\n   \n   In his end-of-season news conference,  Harrison said he was surprised by the city’s depth of feeling for Dončić.\n \n\n   \n  “I did know that Luka was important to the fanbase,” Harrison told reporters during his season-ending news conference. “I didn’t quite know to what level.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Harrison remained staunch in his belief that Dallas has the makings of a winning team despite the trade and fan backlash.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that’s a championship-caliber team and we would have been winning at a high level and that would have quieted some of the outrage,” Harrison said, adding that being healthy is the only thing keeping the team from challenging for a title. “And so unfortunately we weren’t able to do that, so it just continued to go on and on.”\n \n\n   \n  But how the franchise handled the Dončić trade and its immediate aftermath sealed Harrison’s fate in the minds of many Mavs fans.\n \n\n   \n  One of the things that particularly irked fans was a report after the trade that slammed Dončić’s conditioning, with  ESPN  citing sources inside the franchise revealing frustration with his diet. The treatment of a player who was widely revered as an icon in Dallas, especially less than a year after an NBA Finals appearance, went over like a ton of bricks.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone wants to point at Luka’s flaws, at least for a half-second,” Mavs fan Matthew Slovak told CNN. “The overwhelming narrative is that this is the most ridiculous thing ever, but there was that, ‘Yeah, but.’ There is no ‘yeah, but.’ – this is the most indefensible trade of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  In his letter, Dumont emphasized that he understood the frustrations of the fans.\n \n\n   \n  “I understand the profound impact these difficult last several months have had. Please know that I’m fully committed to the success of the Mavericks,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you for your support, thank you for holding us accountable, and thank you for your passion and for your patience. You deserve transparency and a team that reflects your spirit. Our goal is to return winning basketball to Dallas and win championships. Our family is committed to that mission and to continuing to invest in Dallas and the Mavericks’ future.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ben Morse and Andy Scholes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/media/laura-ingraham-trump-fox-news-interview-maga","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:38:00-05:00","title":"‘MAGA backlash’: Laura Ingraham challenged Trump in a way few Fox hosts ever do","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a Fox News interview on November 11, 2025, Laura Ingraham challenged President Donald Trump on several contentious policy issues, including voter economic anxiety, the 50-year mortgage proposal, the East Wing demolition, and student visa policies for Chinese students.

way few Fox hosts ever do \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:38 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Trump’s Fox News interviewers are sometimes so promotional and deferential that little gets challenged, and almost no news is ever made.\n \n\n   \n  However, Laura Ingraham was more strategic than that. On Monday, she sat down with Trump and scrutinized several of his policy proposals, channeling dissension within the pro-Trump ranks — and seemingly catching the president off guard.\n \n\n   \n  Sounding skeptical of Trump’s “costs are way down” defensiveness, the conservative Fox host asked, “Are you saying voters are misperceiving how they feel?”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham also asked about his stance on the government shutdown, his demolition of the East Wing, and his understanding of Christianity.\n \n\n   \n  After she brought up two issues of particular concern to her MAGA media allies, Trump said, “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea. I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham’s approach was in keeping with the tone of her nightly Fox show: She often tries to steer Trump in what she believes is a more productive, ultimately politically successful direction.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was elected in 2016, Ingraham held talks about becoming his press secretary, but she insisted on having a seat at the policymaking table as well. The transition team couldn’t agree on how to make room for her, and Sean Spicer was hired as press secretary instead.\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham has arguably been more influential on the outside, nudging Trump via the television, and occasionally in person.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s interview, when Trump tried to downplay the impacts of recent air travel chaos, she interjected: “There are a lot of delays now, sir.”\n \n\n   \n  She generally framed her questions in a positive light for the president, while still conveying the concerns of Republican voters.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Ingraham brought up voter anxiety about affordability, as seen in last week’s off-year election results. “I know you’ve been all over” the issue, she said, and some prices are “way down,” but “other things, as you noted, have gone up.”\n \n\n   \n  “Is this a voter perception issue of the economy,” she asked, “or is there more that needs to be done by Republicans on Capitol Hill or done in terms of policy?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested a perception problem, saying, “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n  But Ingraham wasn’t buying it. She said Joe Biden was criticized — including by Trump — for “saying things were great, and things weren’t great.”\n \n\n   \n  A little bit later on, she directly asked, “Why are people saying they’re anxious about the economy? Why are they saying that?” Trump rejected the premise of the question.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are” saying that, the president claimed. “I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also waved off Ingraham’s critical question about a recent proposal by Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte for 50-year mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  This idea “has enraged your MAGA friends,” Ingraham pointed out, describing the “significant MAGA backlash” from people who are “calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump didn’t want to hear it. Of the 50-year mortgage proposal, he said, “it’s not even a big deal. I mean, you know, you go from 40 to 50 years and—”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham corrected him: From “30 to 50” years.\n \n\n   \n  “All it means is, you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time,” Trump said. “It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit, but the problem was that Biden did this.”\n \n\n   \n  Then Trump went on to bash Biden some more.\n \n\n   \n  However, Ingraham was more interested in hearing the current president’s views about contentious topics.\n \n\n   \n  She broached conservative disdain for American colleges and universities and said “a lot of MAGA folks, um, are not thrilled about this idea of hundreds of thousands of foreign students in the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fox host specifically raised Trump’s plan to grant student visas for 600,000 Chinese college students, which Trump has justified as a business transaction.\n \n\n   \n  “I know you and I disagree” on this, he said to Ingraham. “We’re never gonna agree on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:35:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks.

What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:35 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Who qualifies and is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/sonder-bankruptcy-marriott-deal-ends","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-05:00","title":"Collapse of Sonder, a Marriott-backed hotel chain, leaves guests stranded mid-stay","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sonder, a short-term rental company once valued at $1 billion and marketed as a hybrid between Airbnb and hotels, collapsed after failing to meet financial obligations, leading to the abrupt termination of its 20-year licensing agreement with Marriott.

D’Aoust probably didn’t expect his anniversary trip to end early, but he definitely didn’t think he’d have just 15 minutes to vacate his room.\n \n\n   \n  The early ejection wasn’t because of a fire or a fight, but a bankruptcy. Sonder, a short-term rentals company abruptly collapsed over the weekend when its partnership with Marriott ended, leaving many guests stranded mid-stay.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust was staying the weekend at a Sonder property in Montréal, Canada, when he got an  email  last Sunday afternoon that he needed to vacate his room by Monday at 9 am. That’s because Sonder’s licensing agreement with Marriott was “no longer in effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the staff if we could still stay until our checkout at 11 am, but the staff explained he had only received instructions to empty the building ASAP and that unfortunately we only had 10 to 15 minutes,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust is just one of the many travelers affected by Sonder’s shutdown following the sudden end of a deal with Marriott, which had let guests book and earn loyalty points at Sonder’s 9,000 furnished apartments and boutique hotel rooms in 40 cities across 10 countries.\n \n\n   \n  Marriott said in a  statement  Sunday that the planned 20-year licensing agreement had ended because of Sonder’s “default,” a.k.a. financial difficulties.\n \n\n   \n  The 2024 deal should’ve had been a boon for Sonder, which was  once valued at $1 billion  and considered a major Airbnb rival. Sonder sought to strike the sweet spot between a hotel and an Airbnb, offering guests the convenience of an all-digital check-in experience but for smaller properties ideal for solo travelers. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and a rough go in the  public markets  in 2022 ultimately spelled its doom. Sonder was relying on the strength of Marriott’s booking platform to give it a much-needed boost.\n \n\n   \n  Sonder said in a statement Monday that it’s “winding down operations immediately” and entering Chapter 7, a complete liquidation of its business. The company blamed “severe financial constraints arising from, among other things, prolonged challenges in the integration of the company’s systems and booking arrangements with Marriott.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories of guests being stranded mid-stay at Sonder properties are  littered  across social media, mostly putting the blame on Marriott. A Marriott spokesperson told CNN that it’s worked “tirelessly to remain informed about Sonder’s financial situation and develop action plans so that we can work to meet the needs of our guests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Marriott is in communication with guests who have existing reservations at Sonder properties booked on Marriott.com and through other Marriott channels, and we are in contact with third-party platforms to communicate with guests who booked on other channels,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  For D’Aoust, that meant an early ending to his weekend away and a two-hour drive back home to Ottawa. But he’s thankful it was just one day lost, and he only missed out on a breakfast reservation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d imagine it’s a little more stressful for folks that had much longer stays,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:15:00-05:00","title":"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela is experiencing a sharp resurgence of inflation—projected to reach over 600% by October 2026—driven by the devaluation of the bolivar, US sanctions on oil exports (particularly affecting Chevron’s operations), and growing economic instability amid political tensions with the United States.

Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:15 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing US  military pressure  and calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela’s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.\n \n\n   \n  “Prices are growing every day,” said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “Corn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,” Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to make  arepas,  the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.\n \n\n   \n  In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.\n \n\n   \n  In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n  The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.\n \n\n   \n  While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.\n \n\n   \n  This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.\n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”\n \n\n   \n  A typical breakfast of croissant and  café con leche  now can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.\n \n\n   \n  The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.\n \n\n   \n  “I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n    War on inflation, one detention at a time\n \n\n   \n  The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.\n \n\n   \n  The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.\n \n\n   \n  For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.\n \n\n   \n  Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.\n \n\n   \n    Several causes\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.\n \n\n   \n  For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.\n \n\n   \n  The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.\n \n\n   \n  In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Chevron said the company “operates globally in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the US government, including in Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The future is crypto\n \n\n   \n  To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/soccer-cristiano-ronaldo-2026-world-cup","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:03:00-05:00","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo Confirms 2026 World Cup Will Be His Last","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cristiano Ronaldo has announced that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be his final international appearance, stating it will 'definitely' be his last due to his age and lifelong dedication to football.

Democrats are responding with their own redistricting actions, resulting in legal battles and political polarization. A key case is in Utah, where a judge rejected a 2021 Republican-drawn map that violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative, ordering a new map likely to produce a Democratic seat.

CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The latest development is in Utah, where a judge rejected a proposed map drawn by the state’s Republican legislature and  ordered the use of one  which is likely to create a Democratic seat. Utah had to create a new map after a ruling that the map drawn by the state legislature in 2021 violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/anthony-lennon-oklahoma-sex-offender-arrest","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-05:00","title":"After 13 Years, Oklahoma Sex Offender Anthony Lennon Arrested Under Alias Justin Phillips","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In March 2012, a crime scene at a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma, revealed the name badge of Anthony Lennon, a man recently charged with possessing child sexual abuse material.

Here’s how officials found him \n       \n  By Chelsea Bailey, Lily Hautau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a Monday in March 2012, detectives with the Moore, Oklahoma, police department were called to a bloody scene at a Super 8 Motel.\n \n\n   \n  They arrived before dawn to find a pool of blood at the bottom of a staircase and a path of bloody footprints heading toward an ice maker.\n \n\n   \n  Lying face up underneath the bottom stair rail – almost as if it had skittered away during a struggle – was a Super 8 employee’s name badge.\n \n\n   \n  Police said it belonged to a man named Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  And that, officers would later tell CNN, made the entire crime scene feel suspicious.\n \n\n   \n  Mere days before he disappeared, prosecutors had charged Lennon with eight counts of possession of child pornography.\n \n\n   \n  But now, he was missing.\n \n\n   \n  Had Lennon been attacked and abducted? Or, as law enforcement would come to suspect, did he stage his own kidnapping and vanish into the night?\n \n\n   \n  Uncovering the truth would lead Moore police detectives and the US Marshals Service on a manhunt that would span 13 years.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a cat and mouse game,” Moore Police Chief Todd Gibson told CNN. “When you commit crimes – when you victimize children – the full resources of (the law enforcement) community are going to come after you, and it’s never going to stop.”\n \n\n   \n    A crime scene ‘made for TV’\n \n\n   \n  Moore Police Detective Jason Landrum still remembers getting the 4 a.m. call to respond to the Super 8.\n \n\n   \n  When he arrived, he said officers were treating the crime as a robbery with a possible kidnapping. But as he walked through the scene, Landrum said something felt off.\n \n\n   \n  The placement of the evidence was suspicious, he said: The name tag was face up, so Lennon’s name was visible; the shoe print; the blood it tracked.\n \n\n   \n  Even the blood splatter itself stood out to the seasoned detectives investigating the scene.\n \n\n   \n  We “worked numerous crime scenes – and have since then – and it’s definitely not normal the way the blood was on the ground,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But subsequent testing, he added, confirmed the blood was indeed Lennon’s.\n \n\n   \n  The TV was still on in the motel’s office, Landrum said, and what appeared to be Lennon’s dinner – a sandwich and some potato chips – was sitting on the table. The register was also left open, he added, and papers had been scattered.\n \n\n   \n  All the signs pointed to a violent robbery and a possible abduction. But Landrum said the timing felt questionable.\n \n\n   \n  This was not the first time Lennon had been charged with possessing child pornography, more commonly described by law enforcement as child sexual abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  In 2010, Lennon pled guilty to five counts of aggravated possession of child sexual abuse material. He was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison, but a judge suspended that sentence and ordered the then 29-year-old to register as a sex offender as one of the conditions of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  By 2012, Oklahoma prosecutors felt they had amassed enough evidence that Lennon had violated his probation that they – once again – charged him with felony possession of child sex abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  But, according to officials, Lennon disappeared on the same day a $100,000 felony warrant for his arrest became active.\n \n\n   \n  “That was pretty coincidental to us,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  Coincidence or not, Lennon had indeed vanished – and he would remain missing for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It reads and sounds like a made-for-TV movie,” Gibson said. And it was only just beginning.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I hope he’s captured before I leave’\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of responding to the crime scene, Landrum said he called the US Marshals Service to request assistance on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I was afraid that he was going to try and flee the country,” Landrum said. “So, I contacted them to help me get word out to the borders.”\n \n\n   \n  But the days after Lennon’s disappearance dragged into months, and eventually, years.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have been really easy for us to just put this in the deactivated file … ” Gibson said. “But there was never a time that we stopped looking.”\n \n\n   \n  To balance their regular caseload, Landrum said Moore police detectives passed the baton to the US Marshals, who specialized in tracking criminals across state lines and solving cold cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Johnny Kuhlman, US Marshal for the Western District of Oklahoma, instructed his team to reopen the case and begin tracking new leads.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, he told CNN, marshals have filed numerous search warrants, conducted multiple interviews and logged hundreds of miles on road trips as they investigated Lennon’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been to several different states looking (for Lennon), following up on leads that turned out not to be true,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office added Lennon’s name to the state’s  10 Most Wanted list .\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he’s been haunted by the thought that Lennon could escape justice for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m getting closer to the end of my career, and this was one that stayed with me,” he said. “I always said that I hope he’s captured before I leave.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, two weeks ago, Landrum got the call he’d been waiting for.\n \n\n   \n    After more than a decade, officers finally make an arrest\n \n\n   \n  US Marshals had been following leads on a man named “Justin Phillips” who was living in Canton, New York – roughly 20 miles from the Canadian border.\n \n\n   \n  After months of investigating, marshals now believed “Phillips” was, in fact, Lennon, who’d been living in the state under an alias.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Moore police and the Marshals Service declined to share additional information about how they located Lennon, saying it could lead to additional charges.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of receiving the call from the US Marshals, Landrum said he’d booked a flight to join investigators working the case about an hour outside of Canton.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a small town,” Landrum said. “We knew our presence would be known fairly quickly with a large amount of us in that area, so we didn’t want to be anywhere close to him because we didn’t want to tip him off.”\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he joined surveillance teams that trailed Lennon as he left his home in Canton and spent the day at the local college where he was enrolled under the alias.\n \n\n   \n  SUNY-Canton confirmed to CNN Monday that an individual using the name Justin Phillips was a student at the school studying in the Engineering Science program.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators followed him to his neighborhood grocery store – and swooped in to make their arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “We still hadn’t 100% confirmed it was Anthony, even though I knew it was because I’ve been staring at his pictures for 13 years,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But he waited to call Gibson and inform the rest of the Moore Police Department until a fingerprint analysis conclusively revealed what he knew to be true:\n \n\n   \n  After 13 years on the run, law enforcement had finally arrested Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as he was driving back to his hotel room, Landrum said he called former detectives who’d worked on the Lennon case and had since retired to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “They haven’t forgot about this case,” he said. “And they were very, very excited.”\n \n\n   \n    He preyed on the ‘wrong community’\n \n\n   \n  But even with the fingerprint evidence, Landrum said, Lennon has continued to stand by the alias “Justin Phillips.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Lennon’s attorney, who confirmed she represents “a man alleged to be Anthony Lennon,” but stressed he is entitled to a presumption of innocence.\n \n\n   \n  She did not offer additional comment on the alleged probation violation and possession of child sexual abuse material charges that her client faces.\n \n\n   \n  Lennon holds a master’s degree in computer science, according to  the US Marshals , and was working toward a doctorate at the time of his disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said he believes Lennon was able to remain hidden for so long, in part, because of his extensive knowledge of computers.\n \n\n   \n  But he credited the tenacity and dedication of dozens of officers, detectives and US Marshals for the apprehension of the man who he said has eluded justice for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Lennon has been living in multiple parts of the country on the run from the law for over a decade,” Gibson said. “He is a person that decided to prey on children in the wrong community.”\n \n\n   \n  “You may think, for a while, that you’ve gotten away with it, and you may get relaxed, and as soon as you let your guard down, you’ll have strong men (and) strong women, knocking down your door to bring you to custody and bring you to justice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

constantly running the numbers to try to solve a problem with no good answer: Figuring out much her two children, both under five, will have to eat, and how much she will have to go without.\n \n\n   \n  The West Virginia single mother earns about $2,800 a month working 40 hours weekly for the state. About half of that goes toward rent. The rest is for daycare and her electric, water and phone bills, leaving her only about $100 from her paycheck for other expenses, including groceries.\n \n\n   \n  Aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, usually adds $265 to her monthly budget for food. But with benefits disrupted  as the government lurches into what is now its longest shutdown on record, Norris now must find other ways to feed her family.\n \n\n   \n  “Rather than myself having, like, a full plate of food along with my kids, I’m making sure that they have a full plate of food,” Norris said. “I may have either less, or I may not eat.”\n \n\n   \n  Tears come to her face as she worries she’s failing her children. “It feels like I’m failing them because I am trying, I’m trying to do all that I can, and, of course, as a human you get frustrated,” she said, “and I never want my kids to see that, or feel like I’m taking that out on them, for something as simple as dinner.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, to pay for food. They are caught in the middle of a protracted budget  standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have, for more than a month,  been unable to come up with an agreement that would fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  The difficult circumstances SNAP recipients are facing have become one of the most pressing issues for lawmakers, who are under pressure to work harder toward an agreement to get the benefits fully funded again.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the state that was the first testing ground in 1961 for what is now SNAP, some 15% of its 1.7 million   residents rely on the benefits today.\n \n\n   \n  Food banks in the state are struggling to meet demand. They were already dealing with budget cuts caused by federal belt tightening    toward the beginning of the year. Now, things are even more stretched as furloughed federal workers become new clients.\n \n\n   \n  One charity in Martinsburg, CCAP/Loaves & Fishes, saw the number of households it serves roughly double from 72 households per week to 159 in the third week of October, and 119 in the fourth.\n \n\n   \n  Even though it is better positioned than other pantries thanks to the generosity of the community and local churches, there are worries about how long it can continue to keep serving at such a rate.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the SNAP benefits are replenished, the federal workers go back to work, we’re going to be just slammed like this all day,” its president, Leigh Fleming, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s a struggle out here’\n \n\n   \n  Following a court order, the Trump administration earlier this week said it would  partially fund SNAP for November.  But the funds won’t cover full benefits, and November payments for millions of Americans who rely on them have been delayed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then appeared to threaten to withhold SNAP funding on Tuesday until Democrats voted to reopen the government. The White House later clarified the administration would follow through on its plan to fund partial food aid during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the federal government’s responses have brought confusion and dismay.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel as though the folks at Washington quite understand the gravity of the situation,” said Norris. “I just don’t understand how we’ve come to a point where we’re using food in politics and being essentially political pawns.”\n \n\n   \n  Laura Bowles, a West Virginia mother of five children aged four to 13 — with a sixth on the way — said she had to explain to her older kids that “there are some right now in the government who can’t figure things out, and we can’t have everything we used to have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  For her family, it means having to buy less food. “My kids eat a lot,” she said. “And groceries are already so expensive these days — it was already hard,” Bowles said. Like Norris, she is cutting back her own food intake to make her kids’ meals stretch further.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband’s paycheck from Walmart, where he works full time and makes $14 an hour, usually covers all their household bills.\n \n\n   \n  But this month, without SNAP, it’s mostly going to groceries. That means the family has had to pick what other bills to pay.\n \n\n   \n  “I let my trash and internet bill slide already,” said Bowles. Only half the electricity and car insurance could be covered, she added, and the family are even cutting back on driving to the park to save money on gas.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan – but it was God’s plan,” she said. “I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senators-government-shutdown-votes-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"08:25:00-05:00","title":"How each senator voted on the bill to end the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate passed a bill to end the longest-ever government shutdown by extending federal funding through January 2026, tied to a broader package that fully funds key federal agencies.

unstoppable force meets an immovable object?\n \n\n   \n  Both are equally powerful, deemed indestructible and when they do meet, the laws of physics are pushed to their limits.\n \n\n   \n  For two years now, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have been those dominant entities in tennis, redefining the boundaries of the game, carving up the Grand Slams between them and rewriting the record books.\n \n\n   \n  It’s apt then that in a year of fine margins, thrilling encounters and breathtaking athleticism, the gripping “Sincaraz” narrative boils down to one final chapter.\n \n\n   \n  The setting? Turin. The tournament? Nitto ATP Finals. The prize? To be crowned the year-end world number one.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n \n\n   \n    Dominant duo\n \n\n   \n  Just as in 2024, the seemingly inseparable duo have swept all four Grand Slam titles in 2025 with each encounter proving more tantalising than the last.\n \n\n   \n  After Sinner defended his Australian Open title in January – his final tournament before serving a suspension for failing two doping tests – what followed was a trilogy of finals of epic proportions.\n \n\n   \n  A French Open for the ages saw Alcaraz prevail, a month later the Italian showed remarkable resilience to bounce back and claim his maiden Wimbledon crown before the Spaniard produced a stunning display to secure a second US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Ten majors so far between them – six to Alcaraz; four to Sinner – leaving the rest of the tour reeling by a considerable margin.\n \n\n   \n  Still only 22 and 24, respectively, and scarily with still room to improve, the rivalry is set to endure.\n \n\n   \n  But is that how they see it?\n \n\n   \n  “I think the word rivalry takes on the professional part, in the tennis side,” Alcaraz told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to find the weaknesses from each other on court but then when we shake hands and we are off the court, we’re totally different.\n \n\n   \n  “We sometimes forgot about the rivalry we were getting on tour and we became persons and that’s what it means, the word rivalry.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m seeing him more than my mom’\n \n\n   \n  That mutual humility, respect and admiration on and off the court has been ever present since their first meeting as teenagers in Alcaraz’s professional debut in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  While their on-court showdowns – characterized by breathtaking rallies and heavy hitting – have left audiences on the edge of their seats, off-court their ever-growing friendship has equally captivated fans around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The duo took to the court for a practice session last week ahead of the main draw, which drew thousands of viewers to the tournament’s live stream.\n \n\n   \n  A post-practice selfie shortly followed, racking up plenty of social media attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When you practice together, see each other in the locker then it’s natural that you get to know each other better and better,” Sinner said of their burgeoning friendship.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about family and life in general, sharing also some personal stuff.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s changed. It just has become better because we know each other better.”\n \n\n   \n  “I said in the summer, I’m seeing him more than, than my mom actually. … I never get tired of seeing him,” Alcaraz jokes.\n \n\n   \n    Race to the top\n \n\n   \n  For this week, at least, that friendship will have to take a back seat as the two vie for the both the season-ending title and honor of finishing 2025 as the tour’s top-ranked player.\n \n\n   \n  Sinner may have taken the bragging rights last year – claiming both in a sensational 2024 – but this time around it’s advantage Alcaraz.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard – who ended the year top of the tree in 2022 – currently holds a slender lead over his rival in the rankings.\n \n\n   \n  He knows that reaching the final with at least one round-robin win or sweeping his round-robin matches will guarantee that award for a second time.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard is firmly on course for that quest, having defeated Australia’s Alex de Minaur on Sunday in his opening match of the tournament.\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Turin would bring with it differing sets of emotions for the two.\n \n\n   \n  For Alcaraz, a first Nitto ATP Finals trophy would cap off what he deems to be his best year to date, having won eight titles this season alone.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard began that quest on Sunday with victory over Australia’s Alex de Minaur in their round-robin clash.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t hide the results. It’s my best year so far without a doubt in terms of level, in terms of consistency” he acknowledges.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw myself grow up a lot since the last year to understand some situations, to realize what I have to do to get to know myself even more and what I need off the court.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is a general situation on and off the court which made this year my best.”\n \n\n   \n    Separated by a hair’s breadth\n \n\n   \n  Sinner meanwhile goes into Turin on a scintillating indoor winning streak having recently brushed aside Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime to win his maiden Paris Masters title.\n \n\n   \n  Whilst his powerful, pinpoint ball placement and supremacy on indoor courts makes him a strong favourite to reclaim his respective crowns, the Italian is aware of the threat posed by his nearest challenger and the expectation to deliver again in front of his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “There is for sure this extra motivation and some pressure so it’s a privilege to be in this position,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something great to finish the year with a win and with an incredible big trophy but you also don’t have to forget how the season went and everything we both have done for the two years, and it has been again a great year.”\n \n\n   \n  So where, if anywhere, will an advantage be gained?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, the secret weapon, could be Alcaraz’s latest bold statement: A dashing black and white haircut.\n \n\n   \n  Looking the part of a comic book hero capable of backing it up with his superhuman skills, the Spaniard hair is in its third incarnation since his initial buzzcut caused a stir at the US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, it’s evolved into platinum blonde and now colors – as Sinner remarked – aptly resembling Turin’s powerhouse football team, Juventus.\n \n\n   \n  “My team are scared about it next year,” the Spaniard says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “This year has been really good with the changes.\n \n\n   \n  “If something works, why should I change it?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/tina-peters-pardon-push-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:59:00-05:00","title":"Trump being urged to intervene in Tina Peters case, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the 2020 election, Tina Peters, a former Republican clerk from Mesa, Colorado, was convicted on state charges for participating in a scheme to prove false claims of mass voter fraud.

      \n  By Kaitlan Collins, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:59 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  Martin confirmed Monday on Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast that the Justice Department wants to see Peters moved to a federal prison.\n \n\n   \n  “(Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche is the guy leading on this. We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said of the Trump administration’s contacts with Colorado officials. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say we want something, you change your tune.”\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Polis and Weiser, who is defending Peters’ convictions in state and federal courts, are “fully synced up” on how to resist Trump’s pressure campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doing her time,” the person said. “We don’t let threats affect us. We have a job to do and we’re going to do it. We are going to uphold the law.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, Polis’ office referred inquiries to the Colorado Department of Corrections. A department spokeswoman, Alondra Gonzalez, said there is currently no formal process underway to move Peters out of state custody and a transfer would require the approval of state prison officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Transferring an individual is an action typically initiated by the Colorado Department of Corrections, not an outside entity, and is based on our internal classification and threat-assessment protocol,” Gonzalez said in an email. “This process is most frequently reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs. The Department has not initiated this process for Tina Peters.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no basis for the (federal) Bureau of Prisons to request a transfer of her custody. Any scheme to prevent her from being held accountable under Colorado law is outrageous,” Weiser said in a statement to CNN, adding that he would oppose any move.\n \n\n   \n  One of Peters’ lawyers, Patrick McSweeney, previously told CNN that Peters hasn’t had any direct contact with Trump from behind bars, but she has heard about his desire to get her out, and “she appreciates the president’s interest in her case, which is unusual for him to be involved in an individual matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/middleeast/istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu-graft-case-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"09:36:00-05:00","title":"Turkish prosecutor seeks 2,000 years for jailed opposition mayor of Istanbul","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Turkish prosecutors have demanded a prison sentence of over 2,000 years for Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition mayor of Istanbul, in a sweeping indictment that alleges he led a criminal network responsible for 160 billion lira ($3.8 billion) in state losses over a decade.

Why do we keep making boxing biopics? \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:30 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sydney Sweeney’s latest movie was down for the count in its opening weekend at the box office.\n \n\n   \n  According to the receipts from  Box Office Mojo , “Christy,” a boxer biopic, was released in more than 2,000 theaters but took in just $1.3 million on opening weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Boxing movies about real people have a tough time connecting with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Christy’ gave even one woman the courage to take her first step toward safety, then we will have succeeded,” Sweeney wrote on Instagram on Monday. “So yes I’m proud. Why? Because we don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact.”\n \n\n   \n  The film tells the story of Christy Martin, a pioneering American boxer, who survived a murder attempt by her trainer-spouse. (Martin is  now married  to a  former competitor , Lisa Holewyne.)\n \n\n   \n  Sweeney is an A-list star but this year she’s been featured in more  controversy-centered headlines  about her advertising work than she has been in  successful  film and TV projects. That attention she’s gotten has not immediately resulted in people in seats this year.\n \n\n   \n  What happened here? The truth about boxing films in general and boxing films starring women may have some answers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year’s “The Fire Inside” starred Ryan Destiny. She played female boxer Claressa “T-Rex” Shields, who competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and has held multiple championships across various weight classes.\n \n\n   \n  It got positive reviews, but only earned $1.96 million in its opening weekend, picking up to $8 million during its entire domestic run, according to Box Office Mojo.\n \n\n   \n  “Against the Ropes,” a 2004 fictionalized version of the life of boxing manager Jackie Kallen, starring Meg Ryan, garnered negative reviews and slim big box office receipts to match.\n \n\n   \n  That played a role in Ryan stepping out of the field for a bit. During  a 2019 interview with the New York Times  Ryan was asked if “Against the Ropes” and another film, “In the Cut,” “had been better received by critics or audiences” would she have still have taken a break from her Hollywood career, as she did.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual,” Ryan said at the time. “I felt done when they felt done, probably.”\n \n\n   \n  What about boxing movies about men? “Hands of Stone,” the Robert De Niro film about Roberto Durán, opened widely in 2016 and  seems to  have tracked very similarly to “Christy,” with a weak opening weekend and a slow follow.\n \n\n   \n  The Miles Teller biopic of Vinny Pazienza, “Bleed for This,”  similarly  failed to fill theaters. “Phantom Punch,” the 2009 Sonny Liston biopic starring Ving Rhames, performed so poorly it has been almost erased from  the permanent record. \n \n\n   \n  It might feel like audiences,  despite their love  of “Raging Bull” and the “Rocky” franchise, just don’t love biographical boxing movies about real people that much.\n \n\n   \n  Except, every once in a while, one film proves an exception to the rule. “The Fighter,” David O. Russell’s fictionalized biography of boxer Micky Ward, was a rare worldwide smash in 2010. Ron Howard’s 2005 “Cinderella Man,” about James J. Braddock and starring Russell Crowe, was also a rare critical and commercial success.\n \n\n   \n  The best-known women’s boxing films aren’t biopics.\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Rodriguez made her movie acting debut in “Girlfight,” a fictional independent film. She played a hot-tempered teen who decides to channel her anger into boxing. The very inexpensive film didn’t pull in a ton of money, but it did launch Rodriguez’s movie career, which has included the billion-dollar “Fast & Furious” franchise. It also made a name for Karyn Kusama, who later directed “Jennifer’s Body” and is an executive producer of “Yellowjackets.”\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s the biggest of them all: the fictional 2004 film “Million Dollar Baby.” Not only did it find commercial success, it met wide critical acclaim. It won best picture at the Academy Awards and stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won best actress and best supporting actor, respectively. Clint Eastwood, who pushed for the film to be made and costarred as well, also won a best director Oscar.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97607","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00-05:00","title":"House votes to fund government, ending longest ever government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House of Representatives ended the longest government shutdown in history by approving a funding bill that extends government operations through January 30, 2026, with some agencies receiving funding through September 2026.

In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a   court battle  because of the shutdown. The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs. But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown —  extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year  — is not addressed in the bill. Instead, as part of the  deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators , Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies. That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure. Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. A lot of pain, not a lot of gain Conventional political wisdom says government shutdowns are not effective tools to advance a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception. The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party honed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown  in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government. With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table. But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government. In the meantime,  42 million Americans who participate with SNAP  didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's  order to scale back flights . Millions of federal workers went without pay. The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient. Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before. Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he  took a step back  during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who  repeatedly   asked   where   Trump  \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions. What happens now?  Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year. Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage. If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year. Some Republicans have shown  interest  in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps. And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/sally-kirkland-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-05:00","title":"Sally Kirkland, stage and screen star who earned an Oscar nomination in ‘Anna,’ dead at 84","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sally Kirkland, an acclaimed actress and former model, has died at the age of 84.

who became a regular on stage, film and TV, best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in “The Sting” and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie “Anna,” has died. She was 84.\n \n\n   \n  Her representative, Michael Greene, said Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.\n \n\n   \n  Friends established a GoFundMe account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland acted in such films as “The Way We Were” with Barbra Streisand, “Revenge” with Kevin Costner, “Cold Feet” with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard’s “EDtv,” Oliver Stone’s “JFK,” “Heatwave” with Cicely Tyson, “High Stakes” with Kathy Bates, “Bruce Almighty” with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie “The Haunted,” about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks’ “Blazing Saddles.”\n \n\n   \n  Her biggest role was in 1987’s “Anna” as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring to a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in “Moonstruck,” Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction, Holly Hunter in ”Broadcast News” and Meryl Streep in “Ironweed.”\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland’s small-screen acting credits include stints on “Criminal Minds,” “Roseanne,” “Head Case” and she was a series regular on the TV shows “Valley of the Dolls” and “Charlie’s Angels.”\n \n\n   \n  Born in New York City, Kirkland’s mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton’s mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol’s “13 Most Beautiful Women” in 1964.

\n\n         In a penny-pinching move, the U.S. Mint has produced its last one-cent coin. The  final penny was minted in Philadelphia Wednesday , 232 years after the first penny rolled off the production line.  The government decided to stop making new pennies because each one costs nearly 4 cents to produce.  The move is expected to save about $56 million a year.  If you have a jar of pennies on your dresser, or a few stuck in your couch cushions, don't worry. They're still perfectly legal for making payments. But of the more than $1 billion worth of pennies in circulation, most never circulate. And it was costing the government a lot of money to keep making more of them.  Some restaurants and retailers are  already struggling with a shortage of pennies .  The phase-out may require businesses to round prices up or down to the nearest nickel, although the growing popularity of non-cash payments makes that less of a headache.  Fewer than one in five payments  are made with cash, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.   Canada, New Zealand and Australia have also eliminated their one-cent coins.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The penny was introduced in 1793 The U.S. began minting pennies in 1793, the year after Congress authorized the Mint. President Abraham Lincoln was the first president to be featured on a coin, starting in 1909, the centennial of his birth.  Carl Sandberg wrote at the time, \"The common, homely face of \"Honest Abe\" will look good on the penny, the coin of the common folk from whom he came and to whom he belongs.\" But Lincoln is also on $5 bill.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., suggested during a hearing earlier this year that phasing out the penny could increase demand for nickels. Minting nickels is also a money-loser for the government, since the five-cent coins cost about 14 cents each.  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers that the administration believes it can break even on nickel production by changing the composition of the coins.  \"I will point out that the dime is very profitable,\" the secretary added.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   There's a big change coming to some small change. The Treasury Department says it's soon planning to stop minting pennies. The copper-colored coins have been in production for more than 200 years, but cash of all kinds is less popular for making payments today. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now with his two cents on this. Scott, so why is the Treasury Department making this move? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, A. It does seem like a big move. The federal government's been minting pennies since 1793, but the coins have become a money-loser. Each one costs almost 4 cents to make, and the government makes billions of them. So by phasing out the penny, the Treasury Department says it expects to save about $56 million a year in material costs, and it hopes to pinch even more pennies down the road through more efficient operations at the mint. MARTÍNEZ: All right, so what's going to happen to all the pennies that are on my - that are on my cabinet? HORSLEY: Yeah, they're - don't worry. They're still legal tender, and that is a relief to you and others because there are an estimated 114 billion pennies out there in the economy. But most don't really circulate. They just sit around gathering dust, like... (SOUNDBITE OF PENNIES RATTLING) HORSLEY: ...The ones I keep... MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter). HORSLEY: ...In the Don Francisco coffee can on my dresser. And, frankly, that's part of the problem, A. Most people don't use the pennies they already have, so the pennies don't change hands. Then stores have to go to the bank and ask for more pennies to make change, and the government has to keep minting them. MARTÍNEZ: So what will businesses do when they can't get more pennies from the government? HORSLEY: Well, they might have to round prices up or down a little bit. You know, maybe we'll see fewer price tags that say $1.99 or 19.99. Luckily, we do have some experience with this. Other countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand phased out their 1-cent coins years ago, and it turns out it's not really a big deal. Keep in mind, more and more people are now using forms of payment other than cash, whether that's credit cards, debit cards or a smartphone app. And according to the Federal Reserve, even for small purchases, under $25 now, shoppers are equally likely to pay with a credit card or a debit card as they are with cash. MARTÍNEZ: Maybe we can get pennies from heaven... HORSLEY: (Laughter) MARTÍNEZ: ...Instead of from the government. That could be another option. Let's just put a pin on that one. So, OK, is getting rid of pennies a step forward maybe toward getting rid of cash altogether? HORSLEY: Probably not - at least not anytime soon. Cash is still used for about 14% of all payments, according to the Fed. Not surprisingly, older people and lower-income families are more likely to use cash than younger, wealthier customers. Whatever your age or income, though, if you start fishing around for a lot of pennies in the checkout line, you're probably going to get some nasty looks from other customers or the cashier. I should mention, pennies are not the only coin the government loses money on. It costs about 14 cents to mint a nickel, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a House committee earlier this month he does think there is a way to break even on those. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT BESSENT: We have looked at this, and we believe that it is possible by changing the composition of the nickel to bring down the cost to 5 cents or less. HORSLEY: And Bessent says the government still makes a profit on dimes. MARTÍNEZ: Is ditching the penny a dig at Abraham Lincoln? HORSLEY: Luckily, Lincoln still has the $5 bill. He was actually the first president to be featured on a coin back in 1909, which was the centennial of his birth. Of course, it was Ben Franklin who said a penny saved is a penny earned, or words to that effect. Franklin's face is on the hundred-dollar bill, and those aren't going anywhere. MARTÍNEZ: Scott, I'd offer you a penny for your thoughts. It costs too much, so just a thank you. That's NPR's Scott Horsley. HORSLEY: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97572","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-05:00","title":"Chess Federation Accuses Kramnik of Harassing Rival Who Died","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Chess Federation (FIDE) has formally filed a complaint against former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik for harassment and the insult of an individual's dignity, following his repeated and unproven accusations of cheating against Daniel Naroditsky, a respected American grandmaster and online chess educator.

She made good on that vow shortly after her swearing in, becoming the decisive 218th signature on the petition to trigger that vote — an effort that's been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. Her swearing in came as  a set of three emails  released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee raised new questions about the extent of President Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019.  The fight over the delay in swearing her  in has galvanized Democrats, who accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of stalling in order to  put off the vote . Johnson had rejected those accusations, recently saying he would allow a vote on the Epstein files. He had previously said he would swear in the winner of the Arizona race as soon as they wanted, but later said he would not do so until after the government reopened.

There's no computer,\" Grijalva  told NPR last month . \"We don't have a government email.\" Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the delays were \"unbelievable,\" but \"those days are over.\" The top Democrat on the House Rules Commitee, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, said the petition could trigger the vote by early December \"if all goes the way we want it to go.\"  Before that, one of Grijalva's first votes is expected to be on whether to reopen the government. Grijalva said she would not support the bipartisan plan passed by the Senate on Monday, saying the concessions secured by Democrats \"weren't significant in making a difference for anybody who's fighting to keep their health care.\" With Grijalva's swearing in, the GOP majority in the House has narrowed to 219 to 214.

His latest effort is a six-part series called  The American Revolution. By focusing on the Revolutionary War ,  Burns is revisiting some very familiar territory. His long and impressive filmography includes a history of Congress, and biographies of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. He's done deep dives into American military conflicts, including  World War II  and the  Vietnam War . Throughout his career, Burns has developed and perfected the tricks of his particular trade: the evocative use of music and quotations from speeches and correspondence; the use of actors to read the words of historical participants; the zooming in and out to reveal key details in period photos; and the painstaking attention to sound effects, from birds to bullets, to help bring those images to life. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       All of that knowledge, and all of those gimmicks, are utilized in  The American Revolution , an exceptional work about the founding of our country. It's written by Geoffrey C. Ward, who wrote  The Civil War  and many other Burns documentaries, including the ones on Congress and Thomas Jefferson. And it's co-directed by Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, both of whom have worked with Burns for years. But  The American Revolution  presents a challenge that even  The Civil War  did not. No photographs, period. To compensate, Burns and company use war re-enactors and place them in the actual historical locations.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On many — let's say most — documentaries using a similar technique, the effect can be cheesy. But in  The American Revolution,  the directors avoid showing the faces of the actors re-enacting battle movements. Instead, parts of their bodies are shown in intense close-up: a bandaged hand here, a muddy boot there. Elsewhere, in an approach that borders on pure art, the directors use drones to capture the action from high, high above. It's unusual — and beautiful. Battles are the surprisingly dominant ingredient of this series.  The American Revolution  goes into more detail about individual battles than I ever learned in my own American history classes — but new and vintage maps, animated to show troop positions and movements, make it all very clear, and very vibrant. The actors quoting from the historical participants, and the historians interviewed to comment on the action, do the rest. Peter Coyote, the actor who has narrated many Burns documentaries, does so again here. He's got a great voice for it, and leans into all the difficult place names, and people's names, with confident authority.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In their various war documentaries, Burns and his team always have focused as much on the ground troops as on the generals — often much more so, telling their story from the bottom up, rather than the top down.  The American Revolution  does both: We hear important observations from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, but also from Native Americans, revolutionary women, enslaved people and others not always given voice in such narratives.  In addition, the program's historians make us think differently about the history we're witnessing. In the colonies, those who were faithful to the crown were called Loyalists, and those against them called themselves Patriots. This series humanizes both sides, and also explains why some Native tribes, including the Shawnees, sided with the British in hopes of protecting their own lands.  The sheer number of the battles, and the details about them, attest to how hard our ancestors fought for the notion of a Federalist society. At the end,  The American Revolution  reminds us that the quest to maintain that society, and to strive to achieve a more perfect union, is far from over.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604384","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00Z","title":"3 Questions About Trump's 50-Year Mortgage Plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has proposed a 50-year mortgage plan to make home ownership more accessible, especially for first-time buyers, claiming it would reduce monthly payments.

\n\n         Most people who take out mortgages go with a 30-year term. But President Trump wants the federal government to back a 50-year mortgage option for homebuyers — a plan that would be \"a complete game changer,\" according to Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Backers of the idea say it could help  more prospective buyers get into a home  they might not otherwise afford. But skepticism abounds, with Fox News' Laura Ingraham  telling Trump this week  that the proposal \"has enraged your MAGA friends.\" Ingraham cited \"significant MAGA backlash, calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.\" Trump said the criticism is overblown: \"All it means is you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.\" The proposal is being floated at a time when many are struggling to get a foothold in the housing market. The  pace of home sales has slowed , as potential buyers navigate two main obstacles: mortgage interest rates spiked in recent years, and home prices continue to rise in many areas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new plan would also expose borrowers to debt for 20 additional years compared to a 30-year mortgage. And because standard  repayment schedules  devote far more money to paying interest in the early years of a loan rather than paying down the principal, it would take home buyers even longer to build equity in their property. \"You're going to be paying almost all interest for the first 10 years. It's really akin to an interest-only loan at that point,\" says Chris Hendrix, senior vice president for the home loans unit of NBKC Bank in Kansas City. He adds, \"that's true for a 30-year loan too: for the first 10 years, you're paying mostly interest on that loan. But it would look even worse on a 50-year loan for sure.\" Many questions remain about the plan, which the Trump administration revealed over the weekend. How do the numbers look on a 50-year versus 30-year mortgage? Using a $400,000 home with a 6.25% interest rate and a 10% down payment as an example, Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner said via email, \"a 50-year loan would save at most about $250 per month compared to the 30-year loan.\" That would help buyers in the short term — but over decades, buyers would end up paying much more. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Total interest on the 50-year loan would amount to $816,396 compared to $438,156 on the 30-year loan, a difference of $378,240,\" he says. \"That's 86% more interest over the life of the loans.\" Berner cautions that his hypothetical example assumes the same interest rate for both loans. In reality, he says, the interest rate for a 50-year loan would be higher than one for 30 years, making the disparity even more pronounced. \"The longer the life of the loan, the more compensation the lender will demand.\" Why would a bank want to offer a 50-year mortgage, and why would a buyer want one? \"Buyers do benefit from spreading out the high cost of a home purchase over a longer period,\" Berner says, \"but lenders certainly benefit too by having a longer period to charge higher interest rates.\" Bruce Marks, the CEO of  the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America , a nonprofit that helps people get low-cost mortgages, is skeptical that home buyers will embrace the plan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It will have no legs because they've tried to do a 40-year term that has not taken off,\" he says, referring to 40-year mortgage modifications that have been offered in earlier attempts to  help struggling homeowners . The 50-year proposal \"is even worse,\" Marks says. \"It will go nowhere. Borrowers will not do it. They see through that. They will know that they will not generate any wealth.\" The potential timing of a 50-year mortgage is uncertain. \"There's a lot of legal analysis\" over the proposal, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett  said this week , as he implied the plan might require legislation. Under the  Dodd-Frank Act , mortgages longer than 30 years don't meet the criteria for qualified mortgages — meaning they're ineligible to get the backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and lenders would be hesitant to offer them. In response to criticisms of the plan, Hassett said homeowners also build equity when their properties appreciate in value. Noting that prices tend to increase, he added, \"I don't think that the absence of equity is a serious concern about this.\" Could other changes help ease the housing crunch? \"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner says. \"The administration would do better to reverse tariff-induced inflation, which is keeping the rates on existing mortgages high, and to encourage the  expansion of housing supply  by promoting homebuilding.\" Hendrix says he understands the White House's motivation: to address a housing crisis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The median homebuyer right now in the nation is 59 years old. It is the highest that it's ever been since we started tracking it since 1981. What else is staggering is the median age for a first-time homebuyer is 40 years old right now. You're looking at a generation that has not had the ability to get into a property, start building equity, start building wealth from a home.\" Lower interest rates could help, Hendrix says. But he adds that the government also has other tools, such as helping first-time homebuyers and encouraging housing construction. One change Marks would like to see is any move that might limit individual homebuyers from being outbid by large corporations that add homes as part of their investment portfolios. Another, he says, is any policy that might support buyers secure mortgages of 30 years or less. \"The 30-year term has always been the sweet spot in this country. And that sets us apart from every other country. And we should not just try to eliminate that or undermine that. We should double down,\" he says, and find ways to give consumers more flexibility and financial well-being. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5605582","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00-05:00","title":"White House Downplays New Epstein Emails That Mention Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee released new emails and documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing discussions between Epstein and figures like Michael Wolff and Ghislaine Maxwell that suggest a close relationship with Donald Trump.

emails Wednesday morning from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that mention President Trump,  raising new questions  about the extent of their relationship.  Republicans on the House Oversight Committee later Wednesday  released the latest set  of more than 20,000 documents that include emails from Epstein frequently expressing displeasure with Trump and his presidency, financial market reports and court documents from Epstein's cases. \"The more Donald Trump tries to cover-up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Oversight Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif. said in a statement. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In one 2015 email between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, the pair discuss a potential question from an upcoming CNN appearance about Trump and Epstein's personal ties. \"I think you should let him hang himself,\" Wolff wrote. \"If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\" Another email Epstein sent in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who has been convicted on trafficking charges, called Trump the \"dog that hasn't barked\" and says Trump spent \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex trafficking victims. Still another is a 2019 message between Epstein and Wolff in which the disgraced financier wrote that \"of course [Trump] knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.\" The email does not elaborate any further. \"I have met some very bad people, none as bad as Trump,\" Epstein wrote in 2017 to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. \"Not one decent cell in his body.\"  On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt sent a statement to NPR that said in part \"the Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\" \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,\" Leavitt wrote. During a press briefing, Leavitt reiterated that the emails \"prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong\" and said the administration \"has done more with respect to transparency when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein than any administration ever.\" In September, House Democrats  released more than 200 pages  of a birthday book for Epstein created more than two decades ago that includes a lewd drawing and letter that appears to be signed by Trump.  The president, who has consistently denied any meaningful connection to Epstein, called the drawing and signature \"fake.\"  Trump has been criticized for paying little heed to his own supporters who have called for a full release of files kept on Epstein and his alleged crimes, before and after he died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. In July, Trump   told reporters  that he and Epstein fell out because Epstein hired away young female employees who worked at the spa at Mar-a-Lago. The release timed with House votes The latest Epstein files revelation comes as the House returns to session for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history.  House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began in October.  But House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay the vote by keeping the chamber out for seven weeks, and most recently by refusing to swear in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Grijalva is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday afternoon. Critics on both sides of the aisle viewed Johnson's refusal as a means of avoiding the vote to direct the Department of Justice to release the Epstein documents. On the campaign trail, Grijalva, who won a special election Sept. 23, promised to sign onto the bipartisan petition spearheaded by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to force a House vote on the Epstein matter. Grijalva's signature marked the 218th one needed to force a vote on the matter. The Epstein files continue to be a political thorn in the president's side, after Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released several emails from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that refer to President Trump. They raise new questions about the extent of their relationship. NPR's Stephen Fowler has taken a look at those emails, and he's here to explain the context. So, Stephen, what do these documents claim to show? STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Well, these new Epstein emails appear to reveal more connections to the disgraced financier. It's part of a 23,000-document release turned over from Epstein's estate to the House Oversight Committee. There's a 2015 email thread between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, where the pair discuss a potential question from an upcoming CNN interview with Trump about Trump and Epstein's personal ties. A section from Wolff reads in part, quote, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,\" end quote. There's another email, A, that Epstein sent in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell - his associate who was also convicted on trafficking charges - that called Trump the dog that hasn't barked and says Trump spent, quote, \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex-trafficking victims. There's a 2019 email between Epstein and Wolff that saw the disgraced financier write that, quote, \"of course\" Trump \"knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.\" The email does not elaborate further, and it's important to note here that NPR has not independently confirmed the veracity of the correspondence. MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, the House is set to return to action after seven weeks of recess. How does this document dump fit into that? FOWLER: These latest Epstein files come as the House returns for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began, but House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay that vote by keeping the chamber out and most recently by refusing to swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Now, Grijalva will be sworn in this afternoon, and there will be enough votes to move forward with this bipartisan Epstein files petition. Ranking member Robert Garcia said in a statement that, quote, \"the more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" and added that the latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president. MARTÍNEZ: So speaking to that relationship, walk us through the timeline of the previous revelations about the Epstein files and the president's political issues with that topic. FOWLER: Well, in September, House Democrats released more than 200 pages of a birthday book for Epstein, created more than two decades ago, that included a lewd drawing and letter that appears to be signed by Trump. The president has consistently denied any meaningful connection to Epstein, the veracity of the birthday book, and has paid little heed to his own supporters, who have called for a full release of the files kept on Epstein and his alleged crimes, both before and after he died by suicide in 2019 in federal custody. In July, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein fell out because Epstein hired away young female employees who worked at the spa at Mar-a-Lago. And as another reminder, A, Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth. And people across the ideological spectrum feel like that is now a promise that Trump has broken. MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Stephen, thanks. FOWLER: Thank you. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 12th, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misspelled Ghislaine Maxwell's name.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97487","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:59:00-05:00","title":"New malaria drug could be a life-saver as the standard drug shows signs of weakness","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new antimalarial drug, GanLum, composed of the novel compound ganaplacide and the established drug lumefantrine, has shown over 97% effectiveness in clinical trials across 12 African countries.

   By Jonathan Lambert \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 4:59 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         At the turn of the millennium, a new class of drugs derived from ancient Chinese herbal medicine revolutionized malaria care. Artemisinin's, as they're called, are based on extracts from the sweet wormwood plant. They arrived just as the drugs used since the 1970s were becoming useless for many, as the parasite that causes malaria evolved resistance. \"The deaths we saw in the late 1990s, the early 2000s — like 2 million a year — that was a direct result of drug failure,\" says  George Jagoe , executive vice president of access and product management at Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit. \"No one ever wants to be behind the 8-ball again.\" Artemisinins have saved millions of lives since then and are now the foundation of malaria treatment worldwide. But there are  worrying signs  that these drugs are following in the footsteps of their predecessors. To prevent history from repeating itself, new drugs that target the malaria parasite differently are required, says Jagoe. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I would call it being ready, having a fire extinguisher in the back that you're ready to use, but maybe not necessarily deploying, versus the house catches on fire and you've got nothing,\" says Jagoe. After more than two decades, researchers are on the cusp of having that fire extinguisher. A new drug, called GanLum, was more than 97% effective at treating malaria in clinical trials carried out across 12 African countries, researchers reported Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Toronto. That's as good, if not better, than the current standard of treatment. If approved by regulators, it could be a powerful new tool against a disease that kills roughly half a million people each year. \"It's a big deal,\" says  Kasturi Haldar , a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied malaria for decades and was not involved in this study. \"It's also pretty timely.\" That's because of artemisinin resistance. First discovered in southeast Asia in the late 2000s, it's recently spread to the continent hardest hit by malaria. \"Partial artemisinin resistance has been spreading quite aggressively across many parts of Africa,\" says  David Fidock , a microbiologist at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. \"We've been sounding the alarm that we must have new drugs to deploy, should resistance lead to treatment failure. [GanLum] will help stem that significantly.\" GanLum stands for ganaplacide/lumefantrine, a combination of two drugs, one new and one old (most antimalarial treatments are combinations of drugs, to target the parasite at different stages of infection). The new one, ganaplacide, was discovered by scientists at Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules   for antimalarial properties. It seems to work by disrupting the malaria parasites' ability to live inside human red blood cells. In the lab, the researchers showed it could kill all known forms of the parasite, including those with mutations linked to artemisinin resistance. It also attacks the stage of the parasite that's responsible for transmission. \"That is very desirable for a drug to have,\" says Haldar, since it can prevent the spread, in addition to just treating the patient. In clinical trial settings, the drug performed well too. The research team enrolled over 16,000 adults and children over 2 years old with malaria across a dozen countries in Africa. Half took GanLum over the course of three days and half got the current artemisinin-based standard of care. The team found both drugs were about equally effective, with GanLum coming out slightly on top. Both drugs had similar levels of side effects, including nausea and diarrhea. But the GanLum group did experience more vomiting. The drug still needs to clear additional regulatory hurdles before it gets to patients. The team thinks that'll take about a year and a half. Even if it's approved and rolled out, GanLum likely won't be fully replacing artemisinin-based treatments anytime soon, since arteminisin-based treatments still work in many areas. \"But at this point, it looks good enough that it could be used where there's a lack of responsiveness to the current [artemisinin-based] drugs,\" says Haldar.  Ultimately, that could prolong the lifespan of both drugs, and help countries avoid the kind of surge in deaths that's happened when resistance overwhelms existing tools. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1145019667","dateOfPublication":"2024-06-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Cultural Diversity and Inclusion: Building a Harmonious and Innovative Society","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article discusses the critical role of cultural diversity and inclusion in fostering a more united and innovative society.

When I looked at my to-do list recently, I noticed that it was kind of all over the place. ☐ Make allergist appointment ☐ Buy razors ☐ Retile kitchen floor ☐ Throw out compost!!! ☐ Figure out meal prepping It's hard to tell which tasks are a priority. Some are urgent and some can wait. Some are quick to complete, others take more time.  Is there a more effective way to write my to-do list? On this episode of Life Kit, I talk to time management experts about  how to create action items that are clear, short and doable.  Here are 7 surprising and useful tips.  1. Follow the two-minute rule.  \"If it takes less than two minutes, just do it right then and there,\" says  Angel Trinidad , founder and CEO of Passion Planner, a company that sells paper and digital planners and journals. \"It's not worth the bandwidth to write it down, remember it and do it.\"  2. Automate what you can.  If you find yourself writing \"buy more dog food\" on your to-do list every few weeks, save yourself the effort of adding it to your to-do list by signing up for a subscription to get the food delivered to your house each month. That can leave space on your list for more important tasks.  3. Break each task into smaller chunks.  People aren't specific enough when they write down items on their to-do lists, says Oliver Burkeman, author of  Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals . And what ends up happening, he adds, is that \"we don't get them done because we're not expressing them in a doable form.\" For example, I want to retile my kitchen floor. Burkeman says that's not a to-do list item because there are too many steps packed into one big goal. Instead, he suggests I should break the project into smaller action items like \"call hardware store for an estimate\" or \"pick out tile.\" 4. Decide what's a priority.  Burkeman has a trick for deciding what's important: Take one of your existing to-do list tasks and ask \"why\" repeatedly — at least five times, he says. For example, why do I want to retile my kitchen floor? To make my apartment look better. Why? Because  a beautiful space makes me feel more at peace . \"Eventually you get to something that feels like  a bedrock value of your life ,\" Burkeman says. \"And if you don't, maybe that's a sign that it's a kind of a zombie project that could be easily abandoned.\" 5. Figure out whether you want to write your to-do list on paper or digitally . Paper can be great because there are only so many tasks you can fit onto a page, says Trinidad. So if you're the kind of person who gets overwhelmed by too many things on your to-do list, the limited space of a piece of paper, a notebook or a physical planner can help you narrow down your priorities.  On the other hand, keeping your to-do list on digital planners like  Asana, ToDoist  and  Trello , or even the notes app on your smartphone, has benefits. You don't have to worry about losing the physical copy of it. They're searchable, says Trinidad — handy when you're looking for a task you may have forgotten. And you can also reorganize and move tasks around easily.  6. Try assigning a task to a time of day.  Take a look at your daily schedule and figure out when you can get your tasks done.  For example, you might write your novel from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., grocery shop from 2 p.m.-3:30 p.m. and drop off your dry cleaning from 3:30-4 p.m. This method, called  time boxing , can narrow down how much you can tackle in a day. \"That kind of awareness gets you thinking, am I spending my time in a way that makes sense for me?\" says Trinidad.  7. Include big life goals on your to-do list.  Your to-do list isn't just for mundane, everyday tasks like sending email and doing laundry. You can also use it to reach your big-picture goals. Ask yourself: \"Who do I want to be? What do I want to experience? What do I want to have?\" says Trinidad. If you want to be more present in your body, you might set a goal to  run a 5K  by the end of the year. If you want to give back to your community, you might volunteer once a week. When adding these goals to your to-do list, don't forget to break them up into smaller, doable tasks.

I'm Marielle Segarra. I keep it to-do list on a notepad on my desk. And when I looked at it recently, I noticed something. It's kind of all over the place. On a given day, it might read, make allergist appointment, buy razors, re-tile kitchen floor, throw out compost, microblading, question mark. Microblading, by the way, is something you do to make your eyebrows look fuller. It's like a tattoo that lasts a couple years. I mean, the list is filled with tasks but some are big and some are small. Some are urgent and some are definitely not. Some I'm not even sure should be on there, like the microblading, which I frantically scribbled down after the lady at my eyebrow threading salon asked who messed up my eyebrows so bad. Hi. Yeah. That was me and a tweezer. But yeah, I've just never felt like I had a good system for making a to-do list and deciding what goes on it. And I don't think I'm alone in that. So today on the show, we are exploring how to make a better to-do list 'cause it's a new year. There's a lot we want to do, and a well-made to-do list can help. ANGEL TRINIDAD: When you make a to-do list that's aligned intentionally with what you want out of your life, it's really powerful. SEGARRA: We'll teach you how to break down your goals into actionable tasks and to figure out a to-do list system that works for you. So to-do lists, they're a tool we use to get stuff done, right? And I mean, how good does it feel when you finally cross off that task that's been hanging over your head? But warning - to-do lists can also become a trap. They can feed our impulse to stay productive at all times. The thing is, we don't want to make a better to-do list just so we can indiscriminately accomplish more. TRINIDAD: It's about doing what matters. SEGARRA: That's Angel Trinidad, the CEO and founder of Passion Planner, a company that makes digital and paper planners that show people how to break down their goals into day-to-day actions. You can access a free version of the planner on their website. So takeaway number one in making a better to-do list, as Angel was saying, decide what matters to you in this moment. 'Cause wouldn't it be great to fill our to-do lists with intention so the stuff on them is actually helping us get somewhere? One way to do this is to come up with a big-picture goal, something that's especially important to you right now, something that would make a big impact in your life. Angel calls it a game-changer. TRINIDAD: What is that one thing that would make everything easier, better? And that answer is different for everyone. SEGARRA: To come up with that goal, ask yourself some questions. TRINIDAD: What do I want to be? What do I want to experience? And what do I want to have? SEGARRA: Maybe you want to be more present in your physical body. If so, your goal could be to run a 5k. Or maybe you want to give back to your community, so your goal is to volunteer once a week. Or you want to become a doctor, so your goal - take the MCAT. Now, sometimes you don't choose the goal. Life hands it to you. TRINIDAD: Like, sometimes your parent is sick or sometimes your dog is sick or maybe you need to find a job or else you're not going to eat. SEGARRA: And that might be your reality for now. Whatever it is, once you have a goal, you'll break it down into actionable steps and deadlines to put on your to-do list. And we'll get to that. First, though, I want to acknowledge, this goal-making approach might feel kind of top-down. Like, maybe you don't have a big-picture goal in mind yet. And that's OK. Oliver Burkeman is a journalist and author. He wrote the book \"4,000 Weeks: Time Management For Mortals.\" That's how many weeks are in the average human life, by the way. And he says another option is to let your current to-do list guide you. OLIVER BURKEMAN: There are various exercises out there like you might know the one that involves asking why five times in succession. SEGARRA: For instance, my to-do list says re-tile kitchen floor. Oliver says I could work backwards from there. BURKEMAN: So, like, I want to re-tile my floor. Why? To make that room look better. Why? And, you know, eventually, you hopefully get to something that feels like a bedrock value of your life. And if you don't, maybe that's a sign that it's a - kind of a zombie project that could be easily abandoned. SEGARRA: Another tip from Oliver - look at the stuff that's filling your to-do list at the moment and ask... BURKEMAN: Do these choices enlarge me or diminish me? SEGARRA: He says this question comes from the psychotherapist James Hollis, and he finds it really clarifying and more useful than asking something like, is this making me happy? BURKEMAN: You know, lots of life is not so happy but can be really meaningful. And plenty of pleasures are kind of shallow and pointless and you don't want to fill up your life with them. SEGARRA: But does this enlarge me? Well, let's use work as an example. Maybe your job right now is hard, but is it the kind of hard that's helping you grow as a person and develop skills, or is it the pointless kind of hard? If it's the latter, maybe it's time to add update resume and pick three jobs to apply to to your to-do list. Once you have a sense of your priorities and your goals, it's time for takeaway two. Pick a system, a way of making a to-do list that works for you. One question to get you started - paper or digital? Angel says some people like paper to-do lists because they're concrete and tactile. TRINIDAD: And what I also love about to-do lists on paper is when you cross it off, there's nothing like it. SEGARRA: Also, paper comes to an end. TRINIDAD: When you put it digitally, there's no end. You can keep going. And I think that's when to-do lists get really overwhelming. It's kind of like a cluttered room. When it's too much, then you just avoid it completely. SEGARRA: Digital has its pluses, though. If you make a to-do list on your phone. It's searchable and quite possibly more organized. If you do choose digital, there are lots of websites and apps you can try. Some are built into your phone, some you can download. Folks on the LIFE KIT team have used the free versions of Todoist, Notion, Asana and Trello. Another question to ask yourself - how do you want to structure your to-do list? Some people prefer a kind of calendar approach with the hours of the day listed. TRINIDAD: I like to time block on my agenda and it's literally making a square of time for the task. SEGARRA: So, you know, Thursday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., I'll be working on my novel. Wednesday from 7 to 8 p.m., I'll be at soccer practice. Friday from 5 to 5:30, I'll be cleaning my apartment. This method is called time boxing and it can be a good way to understand how much you can realistically tackle in a day since you're visually blocking off time for each of your to-dos. TRINIDAD: That kind of awareness gets you thinking, am I spending my time in a way that makes sense for me and what my intention is for my life? SEGARRA: But again, this is about finding a system that works for you. For Oliver, trying to plan this way feels too rigid. BURKEMAN: I've never really found it works to make a very rigorous association between a task and the time of day. Because my moods, my responsibilities as a parent, random emergencies that arise, you just can't sort of say, I'm absolutely going to be doing this thing between 3 and 3:40. You have to with appointments and things, but if you try to do it with everything, very quickly, it feels imprisoning. It feels like life isn't any fun anymore, even if you're working on things that matter. SEGARRA: So another option is a straight-up list of tasks. Call me old-fashioned, but that's what I'm sticking with. Remember, by the way, whatever you pick is just a starting point. BURKEMAN: An important thing here is to feel like your systems for organizing your life can evolve constantly. SEGARRA: Now, once you have a system in mind - takeaway three - it's time to fill your list. Let's start with an acknowledgment. There are some things you just have to get done. The tasks of daily living - refill that prescription, buy groceries, get more toilet paper. Those tasks can go on your to-do list, but they don't necessarily have to. TRINIDAD: There's this thing within the productivity world called the two-minute rule, and it's if it takes less than two minutes, just do it right then and there. You know, it's not worth spending the bandwidth to write it down, hopefully remember it, hopefully do it. SEGARRA: You could also consider automating some of these things, so they never make the to-do list at all. Like, maybe you have toilet paper delivered to your house once a month, you're going to need it. OK, so we're meeting our daily needs, now we want to reflect our bigger goals on our to-do list. Like, maybe one of mine is to redecorate my apartment. The thing is - and this is what trips a lot of people up - that's not a to-do list item. BURKEMAN: So often, things hang around on our to-do lists and we don't get them done because we're not even expressing them in a doable form. SEGARRA: Let's break this down. Which parts of the apartment do I want to redecorate? Well, definitely the kitchen. I want to replace the tile floor. Still not actionable enough. We're going to have to go even smaller. Call the hardware store for an estimate. Now, that's doable. Go look at tile. That's doable. Order the tile. Also doable. These are the kind of things to put on your list or in your planner. Oliver says you also might consider limiting your to-do list to four or five doable tasks at a time. BURKEMAN: And you're not going to add a new one to that list until you've moved one away, thereby freeing up a slot. SEGARRA: That can help you stay focused 'cause you can't do everything at once. And that's takeaway four. Pick something to let go. In his book, Oliver talks about the art of creative neglect. He borrowed that phrasing from graphic novelist and creativity coach Jessica Abel. BURKEMAN: You're going to be not excelling on a whole load of dimensions. If you're going to be, like, a really good parent and a really good employee, then you're probably not going to be able to be a really good, I don't know, runner of triathlons or something. There's a million examples. SEGARRA: We really can't do it all, at least not simultaneously. So as you're making your to-do list with your big-picture goals in mind, pick something to fail at, too. BURKEMAN: Just say, well, OK, instead of constantly being dismayed when I realize that I'm not superhuman, I'm going to make a decision about a few things in advance that for this season of my life, I'm just not going to be doing. So, like, you know what? I'm not going to be keeping a tidy, beautiful house while dealing with a newborn baby and working full time, you know? SEGARRA: And he says, when you choose what to fail at ahead of time, you're really changing your mindset 'cause months from now, when you see your messy house, maybe you won't actually feel like you're failing. Instead, you could see it as a reminder of your values in this moment and what you've committed to. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: OK. time for a recap. Takeaway one, figure out what matters to you. What are your priorities at this moment? Do you have a big goal or project in mind? Takeaway two, pick a to-do list system - paper or digital? Hour by hour or a simple list of tasks? The system can change. This is just a starting point. Takeaway three, fill your list with the tasks of daily living but also with steps toward your big-picture goals. And takeaway four, pick something to fail at. You don't have to do everything all at once, and you definitely don't have to do it all well. Also, remember that to-do lists exist to serve us. We don't answer to them. So if your to-do list is making you feel bad about yourself or your life, crumple it up, throw it out and start over again when you're ready. BURKEMAN: I think that a lot of us seem to go through life feeling like we're in sort of productivity debt, you know? We've got to work really hard today to try to pay off the debt by the end of the day. SEGARRA: But remember, Oliver says, there's nothing you need to do to earn your right to exist. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Before we go, an editorial note. We want to let you know that Angel Trinidad, the founder and CEO of Passion Planner, and LIFE KIT reporter producer Andee Tagle, have been friends since college. But we asked Angel to share their experience with us not because of this personal relationship, but because four other LIFE KIT staffers independently discovered Passion Planner and found it to be a really useful tool to help them manage their time.

We've all bought things we don't need: that candy bar at the grocery store checkout, those aspirational ice skates we  definitely  plan to use this winter.  Unnecessary spending looks different for everyone, but regardless of our financial situation, we could all stand to stretch our dollar a little further. Tiffany Aliche,  better known as the Budgetnista , is a personal finance expert and educator — and she gets it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How To Say No, For The People Pleaser Who Always Says Yes \n       \"We impulse-shop because it feels good in the moment, right? It's like the Band-Aid,\" she says. \"It's the cool glass of water on a really hot summer's day.\"  It's OK to do a little comfort shopping, especially in these tough times — \"but what I've learned is to impulse-shop within parameters,\" Aliche says. Don't let short-term wants get in the way of your long-term savings goals.  Here are a few ways to start curbing that stress-spending and start saving a little smarter — today.  Make a budget. Don't just ballpark it in your head — write it down.  \"Get a clear visual picture of what your money is doing now. The rule is, if it's not written down, then it's not a budget,\" Aliche says. Once you've factored in necessities like food, shelter, water — and savings — then factor in fun. Whether your fun budget is $5 a week or $50 a week, it's important to set that money aside. \"Money is not just meant to be responsible with — you're supposed to enjoy money, to use it as a tool to make your life better,\" says Aliche.  She speaks from personal experience. After over a decade as an early-childhood educator, Aliche lost her job and her home in the 2008 recession and had to move back in with her parents. After rebuilding her financial life from scratch, she decided to share the wealth and became a financial educator.  \"I don't believe in over-sacrifice,\" says Aliche. \"I impulse-shop as well. But what I've learned is to impulse-shop within parameters. So I give myself a weekly, if not monthly, budget where I can buy things within that budget.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  What To Do If You Can't Pay Your Rent \n       Need it, love it, like it, want it. Before you reach for those fun-budget funds, Aliche has a bit of advice. She says to ask yourself, \" 'What are the things that really make me happy? What are the things that really bring me joy?' \"  To keep those priorities straight, Aliche says she has a sticker on top of her computer that says, \"need it, love it, like it, want it.\" And before hitting that purchase button, she wants to make sure that what she's buying is a  love  — that it will bring lasting joy.  \"Likes are short-term joy. That means less than a year, I'll have forgotten about this thing,\" she says. \"Wants are just instant gratification where not even a day later, I'm not going to be interested in this thing.\" Sound familiar? We have all purchased some wants — whether it's a bright purple sequin T-shirt or an artsy tote bag from a concert or Rollerblades that are now gathering dust in the closet. These wants are particularly damaging, Aliche says, because \"not only am I spending money that I don't have, but I'm actually making my life less enjoyable because these things don't give me lasting joy.\" Don't worry if it doesn't come easily at first, Aliche says. \"It's a muscle that you have to practice. Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Braving Your Student Loan Payments: Tips To Pay Off Student Debt  \n       Figure out your \"noodle budget.\"  What is the bare-minimum amount of money that you need to keep going? What are the things that you can drop if times are tough? Aliche calls this her \"noodle budget\" (noodle as in ramen noodles, which she eats when things get tight). \"For some people, it's peanut butter and jelly; for some people, it's rice and beans,\" she explains. When you're strapped for cash, you should be able to cancel your cable or Netflix subscription and switch to ramen noodles before tapping into your savings or (gasp) retirement savings. \"Focus on your budget now and what you can do now, so you don't take from your future,\" she says. And if spending is still an issue, Aliche has a suggestion: First, cut up your credit card. But if you're the kind of person who has auto-saved credit card information into your favorite websites, you've got to go a step further. Call your credit card company, Aliche says, and tell it that you lost your card.  \"They're going to reissue you a card. And when it comes, you're going to cut it or put it away,\" she says. Aliche compares it to digging a ditch and says if you don't want to keep digging deeper and deeper into debt, you have to put the shovel — your credit card — down.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How Solitude Can Help You Regulate Your Mood \n       Create and maintain a savings plan. You should have between three and six months' worth of emergency savings. Set it up in an account that has a good interest rate. Aliche says it's also worth putting this cash in a bank that isn't associated with your checking account, so it isn't convenient or fast to transfer that hard-earned savings.  \"Automation, automation, automation,\" Aliche says. She recommends automatically withdrawing your savings and your bills into separate accounts each month.  \n       \n      Related Story:  4 Ways To Make Your Workplace Equitable For Trans People  \n       Don't cheat your future self — your Wanda! Being responsible with money can be a drag. Instead of impulse-buying a plane ticket to Paris on a credit card, it means saving that money slowly over time. Aliche's way of making this drudgery more fun is a woman named Wanda.  \"I have named my future self. Her name's Wanda. She is sassy and a little bit of a gossip,\" says Aliche. \"Wanda is 70 years old. And I think to myself, 'It is literally my job now, as Tiffany, to take care of Wanda.' And so if I say, 'You know what? I would actually rather have cable now. ... Wanda, you'll be eating ramen' — that's not fair!\" Visualizing and naming your future self is a joyful way to think about saving for your future.  \"It's everyone's job to take care of their older self,\" Aliche says. \"So what can you do now to make sure that your Wanda doesn't have to work as hard?\" Finally, remember to give yourself a break. It is, perhaps, an understatement to say that we live in tough times. Aliche says it's important to give yourself a break if you make a financial mistake.  \"It's OK not to be perfect. It's OK not to know the full way. So be easy on yourself — do the best that you can.\" The podcast portion of this episode was produced by Andee Tagle. We'd love to hear from you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIGAKI: If I were to turn my credit card statements from the last few months into a cliched BuzzFeed listicle, it would read like this - March - sweatpants; April - sweatpants, puzzles; May - cookbook - aspirational - rollerblades - aspirational in the extreme; June - yeast for obligatory bread making; July - a Postal Service costume for my dog - totally worth it; August - somehow, inexplicably, more sweatpants. So I realize I'm really lucky to be in a position where I can buy anything at all right now. But the tricky thing is that money actually is tight, and I really shouldn't be spending much money at all. So why can't I stop buying stuff? TIFFANY ALICHE: We impulse shop because it feels good in the moment, right? It's like the Band-Aid. It's the cool glass of water on a really hot summer's day. MIGAKI: That's Tiffany Aliche, better known as The Budgetnista. She started as an early childhood educator. And nowadays, she teaches folks of all ages about being smart with money. And she says, in these tough times, we're all tempted to do a little comfort shopping. And that's OK - as long as you're not leaving your long-term savings goals by the wayside. ALICHE: Money is there to enhance your life. It is a tool to build up your financial life. And part of that is enjoying some of it as well. I just want you to create a plan where all of those things can happen in harmony. MIGAKI: Unnecessary spending looks different for all of us. But regardless of your financial situation, we could all stand to stretch our dollar a little further. In this episode of LIFE KIT, learn to spend and save smarter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIGAKI: In some ways, it seems like Tiffany Aliche was destined to become The Budgetnista. Growing up, her dad was a CFO with an expertise in accounting. ALICHE: So the attitude towards buying things in our household was, do you need it (laughter), because I'm one of five daughters. And so my dad was, by force, pretty frugal. So I really grew up very utilitarian. Like, is this something I truly need? And I learned not to - not that I didn't crave having kind of, like, the extras and the bells and whistles, but I learned how to manage without having those things. When I first started The Budgetnista, there were - there was hardly anyone who looked like me who was talking about money in a way that made sense, right? Women - especially women and people of color have been left out of the financial conversation for so long. And so when it comes down to it, I am a teacher. And so as a teacher, I also believe myself to be a good - a student - a student of life, a student of finance. And when I learn a thing, I teach a thing, and I do so specifically for this audience because I know how I felt when I was struggling to learn for myself. MIGAKI: Well, I'm very excited that we have you as our teacher here, Tiffany. So I want to start with a scenario, and I think a lot of folks can relate to this. Let's say it's been a long day. The dog's barking. You have a headache going. And all you want to do is kind of turn your brain off and shop for a new pair of fuzzy slippers. I know I'm not alone here. I know we've all had this kind of day. Tell me, why do we impulse shop, and how do we stop it? ALICHE: So we impulse shop because it feels good in the moment, right? It's like the Band-Aid. It's the cool glass of water on a really hot summer's day - instant gratification. And believe me; I am not the same girl I was when I was living at home with my parents. MIGAKI: (Laughter). ALICHE: I (laughter) impulse shop as well. But what I've learned is to impulse shop within parameters. So I give myself a weekly, if not monthly, budget of where I can buy things within that budget. And that helps me to kind of, like, get that cool glass of water, put that Band-Aid on, but without breaking the budget. MIGAKI: OK. So you're saying I can impulse shop, but it's - as long as it's within this system that's already been kind of predetermined. ALICHE: Correct, because I don't believe in over-sacrifice. People are feeling uncertain, they're feeling scared, and some things made them feel better. It's going to be nearly impossible to get people to not do something that makes them feel better in times where everyone's feeling a little uneasy. So that is not my role. That's why I teach people to say, well, how can we do that responsibly? What does that look like? Is it $25 a week? Is it $50 a week? What does that look like? And can you do a trade-off? Like for me, for example, my husband - he really wanted cable when we first moved into our house. And against my better judgment, I was like, I guess. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: But he's starting to realize now that we really don't watch cable, right? So what we've done is that we have cut off the cable - yay - and we've switched out that amount that we were spending, and that's our impulse shop budget. So we're not actually spending more, but we're getting more for the dollar that we spent. MIGAKI: OK, OK. So if you have $20 left in your discretionary budget for the month, is that something that you would then, say, go splurge on a pretty new face mask? Or would you say, I'm going to roll this over into savings? Like, what is the better thing to do in that situation? ALICHE: Well, you know it's so easy to say, save, save, save. But here's the thing. If you've done the right things already, you are allowed - meaning that if your savings account is pretty well stocked, and even if your savings account is not fully funded, let's say - I always say I want you to have at least three months, ideally up to six months, of your lowest denominator expenses. So that's your rent, that mortgage, the things you absolutely have to pay for - insurance - right? - so three to six months of that. So even if you don't have three to six months of that, but you do have a savings plan where you're automatically saving toward that every month and you find yourself with an extra $20, certainly you can put the extra $20 toward that saving. But when do you get to absorb and enjoy your money, as well? Instead, quite honestly, I would use that $20 to have some fun with. If there's excess money, yes, you ought to enjoy it. Money is not just meant to be responsible with. You're supposed to enjoy money, too. It is a tool to make your life better. MIGAKI: (Laughter) I like that. I like that a lot. OK, so what if I'm in the opposite situation where I do not have $20 left at the end of the month? What are some tips you have to help me walk away from the fuzzy slippers or whatever impulse buy I was thinking about? ALICHE: Yes. So many times - and many people are in that position. Many people don't have enough money at the end of the month. So I always say, you either have a spend-too-much issue, or you have a don't-make-enough issue. And so first I want you to address, which issue do you have? If you have more bills, that's where your money is going toward, you probably have a don't-make-enough issue. So you really need to focus on, how can I increase my income? But for many of us, it's a - I actually have more discretionary expenses coming out of my budget every month, so I have a spend-too-much issue. And so what I'm wanting is for you to get clear on, what are the things that really make me happy? What are the things that really bring me joy? And I have this little sticker on top of my computer that says, need it? Love it? Like it? Want it? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ALICHE: And it's a reminder to me when I'm moseying on over to my Amazon account, is this a need, Tiffany The Budgetnista - food, shelter, clothing, water? And most importantly, is this a love? So a love is long-term joy - joy that's going to last you a year or longer. Likes are short-term joy. That means less than a year, I'll have forgotten about this thing. And wants are just instant gratification, where not even a day later I'm not going to be interested in this thing. So I'm wanting you to focus on, if I am going to spend my money on something, then it's going to be a love. And if I don't have enough at the end of the month, then I really shouldn't be wasting any money on likes or wants. So that is something - 'cause it's a muscle that you have to practice. Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? So you can start to rethink the way you spend your money. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIGAKI: Are there some things that are just worth spending a little money on? We got a voice memo from Julie Thaxter-Gourlay (ph), who says she spends a lot of money on her son. JULIE THAXTER-GOURLAY: He can't go out to play with his friends. He doesn't get to go to school. So I end up spending a lot of money on toys for him to play in the house inside of our apartment, as well as online activities and Roblox, of course - always Roblox. MIGAKI: Tiffany, we live in hard times. Is this OK (laughter)? ALICHE: So I totally understand. I have a niece and nephew, ages 3 and 4. They - that tablet - my sister wasn't a tablet person before, and now she's a tablet... (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: So I totally get that. So if you are going to - your kid is obviously super important. But let's not - let's make sure that we're not overcompensating, right? Because have you seen a 4-year-old play with a box? MIGAKI: (Laughter). ALICHE: Like, did you - (laughter) did you really have to buy the $50 toy? So something that you can do is, what can I do to stimulate my kid, and does it have to cost this amount of money? Especially in these days and times, I also don't want you to start training your child that they need expensive things to be entertained. And so being strategic with the things that you purchase to make sure that, yes, they are adding to the joy and the happiness of your child, but that you're not teaching them that this thing must be expensive because it really doesn't have to be. And so if you don't have the excess funds, get really creative by rehashing the toys that your child already has. MIGAKI: You mentioned earlier that you come from a very frugal household. Growing up, my dad was all about shopping the sales. I think right now, he has approximately two gallons of liquid hand soap at his house because he can't resist stocking up when there's a sale. Is this a good reason to spend money? ALICHE: So there is a thin line between frugal and hoarding. It depends. If you are like my family growing up - a family of seven - you know, five kids, two adults - then, yes, buying gallons of hand soap might make sense. If you are family like I am now, a small family, it might not really make sense to buy in bulk, especially on things that are perishable that are going to go bad soon. So what you're going to look at when you do buy in bulk is the unit price - right? - so - because sometimes you think that you're getting a deal because you're buying so much of it. But it's going to tell you per quart, per piece, how much is that thing actually costing me? Compare that to the regular price for the regular size of that item to see, are you really saving or are you just buying more currently? MIGAKI: OK, what about pandemic-related spending that is not of an essential nature, like soap? One of our listeners, Alicia George (ph), is trying to weigh her home improvement decisions. ALICIA GEORGE: Right now, I can't seem to curb my home improvement spending. I never knew I lived in such a fixer-upper until I stopped commuting and started working from home. My husband and I have bought living room wallpaper, materials to stain the kitchen cabinets. We also have plans to refinance and refinish our basement, including adding another bathroom. While I want to believe this is all worthwhile spending and will increase our home value, I worry we could end up sinking too much money into our home. ALICHE: So, Alicia, you are absolutely right. So what I would do first before I did any home improvement project is that I would have - or get on the phone a realtor, right? A realtor is going to know best where you put your money, where you're going to find the biggest return on investment. And so that's what I did. My husband and I recently renovated the home that I'm in now. We bought it. It was a total fixer-upper. And I had a realtor who was also a designer help me decide where to put the money. Like, did we really need super high-end backsplash? I don't know. Are you going to get your money back from there? So she literally walked us through room by room and said, this is where you spend a little extra; this is where you can spend a little less. But fixing up your home is not just for potential resale. You also want to be comfortable. But you want to make sure that where you're placing the bulk of your money is not going to not make a difference years down the line, should you sell that home. MIGAKI: What if you have already done the damage and you've already made a lot of impulse purchases? What's the recovery process for that? ALICHE: So the recovery process is to cut up the cards. Stop, right? So something you can do a friend of mine did, which I thought really brilliant, is to call the credit card companies and say that you lost your card because sometimes you'll say, oh, I'm going to cut up my card, but you know what happens when we go onto Amazon. It's right there (laughter). No, no, no. Call your credit card companies. Hi, I lost my card. So what they're going to do is they're going to reissue you a card. And when it comes, you're going to cut it or put it away. But you know that that card's not stored in your phone or your laptop. So you have - if you're in a ditch and someone gives you a shovel, which is your card, if you don't want to keep getting deeper and deeper into the ditch, you have to put the shovel down. You have to put your card down. People are wasteful at every level, whether you are in your 60s, in your 50s, in your 30s. I just think this is that, ultimately, you have to identify, what are your goals? I want to buy a home when I'm this age. I want a long vacation. I want - to me, there's no judgment on goals. I think it's important that people identify their own personal goals and then align their spending and their money with their goals. MIGAKI: And speaking - I mean, we mentioned that we're kind of - our economy is once again in recession. What are your thoughts on putting away retirement right now? Money's tight for a lot of folks. And I think there's probably a temptation to pull some of that - the money that you were going to put into retirement and put it into your budget for everyday use. ALICHE: I say that before you pull any of that money into your budget for everyday use, make sure that you don't have excess in your daily budget. So if, you know, you still have kind of like the cable on, you're still paying for things that are not essential, then I wouldn't take from retirement yet. See what she could do within the parameters of your current budget, all right? I call it your noodle budget. And sometimes you have to drop down and get your noodle on. That's your ramen noodle budget. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: Right? Remember some people - for some people it's peanut butter and jelly budget. For some people it's rice and beans, right? Meaning, are there things that if I had to eat ramen noodles because money was tight, what are the things I'd get rid of? Get rid of some of those things before you start taking from your future. So I have named my future self. Her name is Wanda. She is sassy and a little bit of a gossip because, I mean, Wanda has nothing to do. She's retired. Wanda is 70 years old. And I think to myself, it is literally my job now - as Tiffany - to take care of Wanda. And so if I say, you know what? I'd actually rather have cable now, oh well for you, Wanda, you'll be eating ramen - that's not fair, right? MIGAKI: (Laughter) ALICHE: Wanda can't work as hard. Wanda is not going to be paid as much. So then it is my job, and it's everyone's job to take care of their older self. So what can you do now to make sure that your Wanda doesn't have to work as hard? Now, if you've done all the cutting, you're working really hard and there's still not enough, then I can understand. But I want you to focus on your budget currently now and what you can do now, so you don't take from your future. MIGAKI: I think it really helps to visualize a future retirement and a future person, rather than this, like, amorphous retirement phase that feels completely out of reach. ALICHE: (Laughter) Yes. (Laughter) Because I like to have fun with Wanda. Because I'll do stuff and I could just, like, pretend. I'm like, oh, what would Wanda say about this? Wanda'd be like, oh, OK. So, oh, so Top Ramen. That's what I'm doing because you've decided that you want to go to Paris and put it on your credit card, even though you know you don't have the money to pay it off. OK. MIGAKI: Wanda's a little snarky. ALICHE: Exactly, and I like it. Because I'm like, oh, gosh, OK, Wanda. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: Like, you know what? I will save for Paris instead. I think that's a good idea. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: And so you have fun with it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ALICHE: Money can be kind of a drag. And sometimes being responsible with your funds can be kind of a drag. But if you can punch it up and make it fun, it takes this, like, pressure off of me, you know, of having to be so financially responsible. What I'm really saying is, what is really best for Wanda? I want Wanda to be fly. I want Wanda to have a nice house. I want Wanda to have plenty of space. So what do I have to do now as Tiffany to make sure that my Wanda is OK? It feels less drag-ish than, I've got to be responsible for retirement. MIGAKI: I got to get myself an old lady name. ALICHE: Yes. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: You do. (Laughter) You do. It makes it fun. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIGAKI: OK, OK. My head is spinning. That was so much helpful information. So let's recap what we've learned with the Budgetnista. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIGAKI: Takeaway No. 1 - make a budget. Don't just ballpark it in your head. Write it down. ALICHE: Get a clear visual picture of what your money is doing now. The rule is if it's not written down, then it's not a budget. MIGAKI: Takeaway No. 2 - distinguish between those must-haves and can-do-withouts. ALICHE: Need it, love it, like it, want it. (Fingers snapping) Need it, love it, like it, want it. That is their new song for the day. MIGAKI: Takeaway No. 3 - identify your noodle budget, your peanut butter jelly budget. What's the absolute minimum you can spend in a month? ALICHE: You don't have to live there if money's not tight. But what are your essential expenses that you must pay for in order to maintain your life, and what are the excess expenses? If things are tight, you know you can pivot and drop down to get your noodle on. MIGAKI: Takeaway No. 4 - create and maintain a savings plan. ALICHE: Ideally three months, up to six months' worth of emergency savings. MIGAKI: Takeaway No. 5 - don't cheat your future self, your Wanda. ALICHE: And it's everyone's job to take care of their older self. So what can you do now to make sure that your Wanda doesn't have to work as hard? MIGAKI: And remember, give yourself a break. ALICHE: These are really hard times. It's OK not to be perfect. It's OK not to know the full way. So be easy on yourself. Do the best that you can. And navigate with someone else, not just by yourself. Name your Wanda. Walk towards your financial freedom together. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIGAKI: That was Tiffany Aliche aka the Budgetnista.

GABRIEL QUINTEROS: Hi, LIFE KIT. My life hack is putting on a pillowcase quickly and efficiently. You take your pillowcase, you turn it completely inside out. Then you take your pillow, put the opposite end of the pillow case - the ones without the hole on the corners of the pillow. Then you just slide the pillowcase right over. It helps greatly instead of having to wiggle and fight with the pillow. All right. Good bye. MIGAKI: Do you have a random tip?

        By The Associated Press \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 8:05 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         U.S. Catholic bishops voted Wednesday to make official a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender patients at Catholic hospitals. The step formalizes a yearslong process for the U.S. church to address transgender health care. From a Baltimore hotel ballroom, the bishops overwhelmingly approved revisions to their ethical and religious directives that guide the nation's thousands of Catholic health care institutions and providers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       More than one in seven patients in the U.S. are treated each day at Catholic hospitals, according to the Catholic Health Association. Catholic hospitals are the only medical center in some communities. Major medical groups and health organizations support gender-affirming care for transgender patients. Most Catholic health care institutions have taken a conservative approach and not offered gender-affirming care, which may involve hormonal, psychological and surgical treatments. The new directives will formalize that mandate. Bishops will have autonomy in making the directives into law for their dioceses. \"With regard to the gender ideology, I think it's very important the church makes a strong statement here,\" said Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota's Winona-Rochester diocese during the public discussion of the revised directives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Catholic Health Association thanked the bishops for incorporating much of the organization's feedback into the directives. It said in a statement, \"Catholic providers will continue to welcome those who seek medical care from us and identify as transgender. We will continue to treat these individuals with dignity and respect, which is consistent with Catholic social teaching and our moral obligation to serve everyone, particularly those who are marginalized.\" The new guidelines incorporate earlier documents on gender identity from the Vatican in 2024 and the U.S. bishops in 2023. In the 2023 doctrinal note, titled \"Moral Limits to the Technological Manipulation of the Human Body,\" the bishops specified: \"Catholic health care services must not perform interventions, whether surgical or chemical, that aim to transform the sexual characteristics of a human body into those of the opposite sex, or take part in the development of such procedures.\" Progressive religious voices respond The Catholic Church is not monolithic when it comes to transgender rights. Some parishes and priests welcome trans Catholics into the fold, while others are not as accepting. \"Catholic teaching upholds the invaluable dignity of every human life, and for many trans people, gender-affirming care is what makes life livable,\" said Michael Sennett, a trans man who is active in his Massachusetts parish. Sennett serves on the board of New Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church. In 2024, the group arranged a meeting with Pope Francis to discuss the need for gender-affirming care. New Ways Ministry's executive director, Francis DeBernardo, said that for many transgender Catholics he knows, \"the transition process was not just a biological necessity, but a spiritual imperative. That if they were going to be living as authentic people in the way that they believe God made them, then transition becomes a necessary thing.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the same day that U.S. Catholic bishops were discussing gender identity, the heads of several major progressive religious denominations issued a statement in support of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people, at a time when many state legislatures and the Trump administration are curtailing their rights. The 10 signers included the heads of the Unitarian Universalist Association, the Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). \"During a time when our country is placing their lives under increasingly serious threat, there is a disgraceful misconception that all people of faith do not affirm the full spectrum of gender – a great many of us do. Let it be known instead that our beloveds are created in the image of God – Holy and whole,\" the religious leaders said in a statement. U.S. bishops united in their concern for immigrants The Catholic bishops, wrapping up their conference in Baltimore, overwhelmingly approved a \"special message\" on immigration Wednesday. Such pastoral statements are rare; the last was in 2013 in response to the Obama administration's mandate for insurers to provide contraception coverage. Catholic leaders individually have criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Fear of immigration enforcement has suppressed Mass attendance at some parishes. Local clerics are fighting to administer sacraments to detained immigrants. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement,\" the bishops' statement reads. \"We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.\" In a show of unity, multiple bishops stood up to speak in favor of the statement during the final afternoon discussion, including Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul Coakley, the newly elected president of the conference. \"I'm strongly in support of it for the good of our immigrant brothers and sisters, but also to find a nice balance,\" Coakley said, noting that they call \"upon our lawmakers and our administration to offer us a meaningful path of reform of our immigration system.\" Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich walked to the microphone to recommend stronger language around mass deportation. \"That seems to be the central issue we are facing with our people at this time,\" he said. His brother bishops agreed. The updated text now states that U.S. Catholic bishops \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5274739","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:19:00-05:00","title":"The U.S. saw vivid northern lights as far south as Florida — and more could be coming","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 12, 2025, the United States witnessed an unusually southern expansion of the northern lights, visible as far south as Florida and Alabama, due to a powerful geomagnetic storm driven by two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun.

November 12, 2025 • 10:19 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Geomagnetic storms brought the northern lights to much of the U.S. on Tuesday night, painting the sky in vibrant hues of green and pink. The Aurora Borealis was spotted in a large swath of states, including  Idaho ,  Iowa ,  Missouri ,  New Mexico ,  New York ,  Oklahoma ,  South Dakota ,  Tennessee ,  Texas  and  Washington  state. Northern lights were visible as far south as parts of  Florida  and  Alabama , a  relatively rare  occurrence that highlights the severity of this week's storms. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Well, we had activity tonight — a lot of geomagnetic storm activity,\" Shawn Dahl, service coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center, said in a  video on X . A  geomagnetic storm  happens when charged particles from the sun's atmosphere interact with the Earth's magnetic field. In addition to creating  dazzling displays of color , such storms can  disrupt technology  on Earth, from satellites and GPS to radio communications and the power grid. Tuesday's activity was the result of a phenomenon called  coronal mass ejections  (CMEs), massive blasts of plasma and magnetic field from the sun's outer atmosphere that grow in size as they hurtle towards Earth. Two CMEs arrived on Earth on Tuesday, Dahl said. The resulting storm  reached G4 levels , the second-highest on NOAA's five-step scale, and created a magnetic field that was \"not only eight times stronger than what's normal but … also favorable for continued activity,\" Dahl said in a  later update . Forecasters are awaiting a third and final CME, which they expect will arrive on Earth at  midday Wednesday  and be even stronger than the previous two. \"That was the most energetic and strongest of this activity out there in space,\" Dahl said. \"It was traveling significantly faster than these other two, and we think that's going to pack even a stronger punch than what we've already experienced.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  Space Weather Prediction Center says  the aurora may become visible \"over much of the northern half of the country, and maybe as far south as Alabama to northern California.\" The  Met Office , the U.K.'s national weather service, says the aurora may also be visible over parts of Britain on Wednesday night, though it is likely to be obscured by cloud cover — as was the  case in Michigan  on Tuesday. Luckily, Americans in northern states won't have to wait long for another chance to get a glimpse. How to see (and photograph!) the northern lights  A dark setting is essential to see the aurora, so it's important to get away from light pollution if you want a good glimpse of the northern lights. It'll be easiest to see between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time, according to NOAA. It is difficult to predict the exact timing and location of the northern lights, but you can sign up for different services that alert you when an aurora may be visible in your area. For example, a citizen science platform called  Aurorasaurus  allows users to report when and where they see an aurora, and gives estimates on how visible an aurora is in a given area. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Another option is an app called My Aurora Forecast & Alerts, available for download on both iOS and Android devices. This is a location-based app that gives viewing probability and forecasts. Smartphone cameras are better at capturing the full array of an aurora than our naked eye, so be sure to go out with your phone to view a fuller spectrum of colors. If your phone camera has a night mode option, it's best to switch it on when photographing the northern lights. You can also switch your phone camera to manual mode and adjust the exposure settings to get the perfect picture. Why we are seeing more northern lights  Auroras have been happening more frequently in the United States for a while, and will continue to do so for several months. This influx of shimmering colors comes because the sun is reaching the peak of its 11-year cycle and, therefore, its solar maximum. The solar maximum causes solar eruptions, and this increase of activity brings ions, or electrically charged particles, closer to Earth. This stream of particles is known as the solar wind. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As solar winds get closer to Earth, the charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere. When they collide, light is emitted. The light emits at various wavelengths, creating a colorful display throughout the night sky. When the sun is at its solar maximum, the number of solar eruptions increases, which is why there are more auroras in the sky. Usually, this activity only takes place near the Arctic Circle, but since solar activity is strong right now, viewing areas have expanded to other regions, like the Midwest. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5605557","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:52:00Z","title":"Tatsuya Nakadai, an icon of Japanese cinema, has died at 92","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tatsuya Nakadai, one of Japan’s most iconic actors and a central figure in the 'Golden Age' of Japanese cinema, has died at the age of 92.

Japanese cinema, has died at 92 \n         By Alina Edwards \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 5:52 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Tatsuya Nakadai, a veteran Japanese actor best known for films such as  Ran, High and Low  and  Harakiri , died on Saturday at the age of 92. His collaborations with some of the greatest directors in Japan cemented him as an icon of the \"Golden Age\" of Japanese cinema. He died from pneumonia, according to a statement from  Mumeijuku , the acting school and theater company that Nakadai founded. Nakadai began his career as a theater actor, and remained committed to the stage throughout his life — in part because, unlike many actors at the time, he declined to sign an exclusive contract with a film studio. Doing so also gave him freedom to take on different roles — in samurai epics, realist dramas, crime thrillers, and even science fiction — and work with many different directors over the course of his career. After a brief cameo in Akira Kurosawa's 1954 movie  Seven Samurai , the film that also happens to be the actor's most revered internationally, he played the lead in Masaki Kobayashi's trilogy  The Human Condition  (1959–1961). The series stars Nakadai as a pacifist soldier in World War II-era Japan. He credited much of his success to Kobayashi, whom he regarded as a mentor. \"While I'm greatly indebted to Kurosawa,\" he told the Criterion Channel in  an interview translated to English , \"the director who discovered me and made me into the working actor that I am today was Masaki Kobayashi.\" While filming  The Human Condition,  which took around four years to complete, Nakadai continued to work with Kurosawa. He starred alongside Toshiro Mifune, another legend of Japanese cinema, in  Yojimbo  in 1961 and  High and Low  in 1963. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       With  Harakiri , Nakadai's partnership with Kobayashi came to a crescendo. The 1962 film stars Nakadai as a lone samurai asking a local lord for permission to commit harakiri, a form of ritual suicide. The actor used a stylized storytelling voice to play the character as he narrates the events that led to his downfall, evoking kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater. In a 2005  interview , Nakadai described the film as a \"drama of dialogue,\" which allowed him to apply what he'd learned on the stage to his performance on screen. No surprise, then, that the actor, who considered theater acting his primary profession, favored  Harakiri  above all his other films. Perhaps his most famous role came in 1985 with Kurosawa's last epic,  Ran , loosely based on  King Lear . Although he was only in his fifties, Nakadai starred as the aging warlord Hidetora Ichimonji, donning heavy makeup in order to fully embody the character.   The plentiful opportunities that Nakadai enjoyed as an actor came with a great deal of pressure. \"For me, my twenties were like climbing Mount Fuji with a heavy load on my back, huffing and puffing,\" he said in 2005. \"It felt like I was climbing, and the heavy load was everyone's masterpieces.\" The \"heavy load\" he bore as a significant contributor to the growth of Japanese cinema has not been overlooked in Japan. In 1996, he was awarded Japan's Medal with Purple Ribbon, honoring those with achievements in arts and academics, and in 2015, the emperor granted him the Order of Culture, the highest honor bestowed upon citizens with major achievements in the arts and sciences. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5546754","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"It's Harder to Get Home Insurance.

That's changing communities across the U.S. \n         By Michael Copley, Lauren Sommer, Rebecca Hersher, Sanidhya Sharma \n        \n           Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 5:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Home insurance is getting more expensive in the United States, and insurers are pulling back from some regions as the cost of disasters grows.   That trend is stretching the limits of what ordinary Americans can afford to protect their homes. Community leaders across the country are sounding the alarm about a nascent, but growing, crisis — one that's likely to get worse as climate change drives more severe hurricanes, floods and wildfires. \"The risk of many weather-related extreme events is growing as the planet warms, and some of those impacts are coming fast and furious now,\" says Carolyn Kousky, an economic policy expert at the Environmental Defense Fund and longtime property insurance researcher. Disaster costs are also rising because people continue to move to coastal regions vulnerable to hurricanes and to forested areas prone to wildfires. That means more property is in harm's way. And inflation, which has hit the cost of building materials  particularly hard , has made it more expensive to rebuild. Nationwide, the cost of home insurance rose about 8% faster than overall inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a  landmark report  published by the Treasury Department in January. As losses from disasters mount, insurers are passing the costs on to consumers. \"We've seen growing prices everywhere,\" Kousky says. That's hitting family budgets that are already stretched thin by rising food and transportation costs. Home insurance is required for most homeowners in the U.S. who have a mortgage. And if you rent, your landlord probably passes along the rising cost of insurance by raising your rent. \"If people want to keep building more expensive homes in areas with high climate risk, the cost to insure those are going to increase,\" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group. NPR visited three communities, in three different parts of the country, to understand the cascading effects of unaffordable home insurance, and what might be done to bring down prices. Home insurance woes are unfolding nationwide, not just in wildfire or hurricane-prone areas Some coastal states have been grappling with expensive home insurance for decades, but in recent years the problems have arrived in the middle of the country. Areas that are prone to hurricanes, such as the Gulf Coast, have long had some of the country's most expensive insurance markets. Homeowners in the region have also seen a spike in insurers dropping coverage in recent years. Florida's nonrenewal rate jumped by 280% between 2018 and 2023, according to  a 2024 report  from the Senate Budget Committee. California, which has suffered billions of dollars of property damage from wildfires, has also struggled as major insurance companies have pulled out of the state in recent years. But the center of the country has also become a hot spot, according to the Treasury report from earlier this year. The average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers paying upwards of 45% more than the average in some parts of the region. That's in part because of rising losses from hailstorms. In 2024, hailstorms caused an  estimated $160 billion  in damage to homes nationwide, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a billiard ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have  more frequent hail  as the planet warms up. In Cozad, Neb., a hail storm last year caused an estimated $100 million in damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith, in a town of just 4,000 people. After the storm, many homeowners and business owners in town say they were dropped by their insurers and forced to scramble to find new, generally more expensive, policies. Others saw the price of their existing policies go up significantly. The average cost of homeowners insurance in Nebraska this year is nearly $6,400, according to  Bankrate . That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average. \"It's just becoming unaffordable in our state, is the new reality,\" says Josh Tapio, an insurance agent with All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb. Unaffordable home insurance is already pushing out middle class residents in Florida Along Florida's southwest coast, Realtors say a wave of foreclosures could be coming as people struggle to pay for homeowners and flood insurance. \"There are people that thought they had set themselves up to retire in their home and be able to afford it on their fixed income that can't do that anymore,\" says Jessica Gatewood, a Realtor in Fort Myers. \"It boils down to insurance costs.\" Floridians are paying nearly $5,800 on average this year for home insurance, according to  Bankrate . That's the third-highest rate in the country and about $3,350 above the national average. On top of home insurance, a lot of homeowners in Florida's coastal communities also have to pay thousands of dollars a year for  flood insurance . Shelton Weeks, director of the Lucas Institute for Real Estate Development and Finance at Florida Gulf Coast University, says high insurance costs appear to be depressing home values in the area. When insurance prices rise, the overall cost of homeownership goes up, limiting the pool of potential buyers able to afford the monthly expense. That puts pressure on sellers to lower their asking price to be more competitive. In other cases, buyers are avoiding houses with high insurance costs because they don't want to live in risky areas, says Gatewood, the Fort Myers Realtor. Researchers at Florida State University  found  a 10% increase in the cost of homeowners insurance reduces housing prices by 4.6%. In Lee County, where Fort Myers is located, home values in September were down more than 10% from a year earlier and almost 16% lower than in August 2022, the month before  Hurricane Ian devastated  parts of the county,  according to Zillow , a real estate website. What's happening in southwest Florida is a warning for communities around the country, says David Burt, chief executive of DeltaTerra Capital, an investment research and consulting firm focused on climate risks. Burt's firm estimates that in about one in five U.S. communities, home values need to fall by around 30% in the coming years to account for rising home insurance costs. That sort of decline in home values could fuel mortgage defaults, Burt says. When people owe more for a home than their properties are worth, they lose an incentive to continue repaying their lenders. If defaults rise, Burt says the impact would be felt across the U.S. housing market. \"If this does lead, as we would expect, to fairly widespread foreclosure events in Florida and California and lots of other places, then, at some point, the cost of a mortgage goes up everywhere,\" Burt says. One way to lower the cost of disasters is for homeowners and communities to better protect themselves by investing in things like fortified roofs and flood panels that can rise automatically to stop water from getting into buildings. That kind of work has already started, but consumer advocates say people  aren't yet seeing significant benefits  in the cost or availability of home insurance. One solution? Give homeowners, and communities, credit when they do things to protect against extreme weather Lake County, Calif., has come to expect wildfires. Where some communities have lost homes in one catastrophic blaze, Lake County has seen nine since 2015. Its rolling hillsides are covered in trees and brush. The repeated losses have been a wake-up call, spurring the community to begin a broad range of projects to lower the wildfire risk. In the Kelseyville neighborhood, residents are  getting home makeovers . Flammable vegetation is being cut back, bark mulch is being replaced with gravel and wooden gates are being replaced with metal ones. The goal is to retrofit homes so they're much less likely to burn, resistant to the  tiny, airborne embers  that ignite most houses. The program is  part of a new pilot , funded by state and federal dollars, to improve the safety of entire neighborhoods by clustering the improvements. Since wildfires spread from house to house once they begin, fortifying groups of houses dramatically improves the chances they'll survive. Lake County is also working on cutting back vegetation surrounding neighborhoods, creating fuel breaks and safer evacuation routes. \"The insurance crisis is one of the symptoms that is showing us our vulnerabilities,\" says Jessica Pyska of the Lake County Board of Supervisors. \"We want our communities to be safe and we need them to be insurable and we need to have lower risk.\" Still, despite Lake County's work, the insurance outlook keeps getting worse. Insurance policy cancellations have risen faster in Lake County than almost anywhere else in the country, according to the 2024 report from the Senate Budget Committee. The only option for many residents is California's last-resort insurance, the FAIR plan, which is currently seeking approval from state regulators for a 36% increase in premiums. Insurance companies in California have begun  offering small discounts  to homeowners that retrofit their homes. But larger community-wide efforts are often not reflected in the companies' risk analysis. One problem is that insurance companies aren't necessarily gathering data about how communities are reducing risk. \"If that information is not accessible on a consistent basis through a trusted source, insurance companies cannot legitimately rely on it,\" says Nancy Watkins, consulting actuary with Milliman, a risk analysis firm. \"It's in California's very best interest to make sure that the insurance industry is aware of it.\" Watkins is helping launch a database of community and landscape wildfire projects, known as the  WUI Data Commons . The idea is to aggregate that information to help communities understand their risk and for insurance companies to reflect those efforts in their premiums. Watkins says there's still a lot to be figured out, like how to protect consumer privacy and to get insurance companies on board. Disaster experts say given how vulnerable many communities are to wildfires and storms, it's vital that the insurance industry incentivize preparation by rewarding those efforts with better insurance rates. \"It's starting, but more needs to be done,\" Kousky says. \"It's important they do that to build trust in the market, to send an information signal to consumers and communities, and to create that financial incentive.\" NPR's Ryan Kellman and Robert Benincasa contributed to this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-tsa-trump-pat-downs-homeland-security-airport-c8cc93725cf71f02683e71e04d143141","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:05:15+00:00","title":"Transgender TSA Officer Sues DHS Over Policy Banning Pat-Down Duties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal lawsuit filed by transgender TSA officer Danielle Mittereder alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration, violated civil rights by implementing a policy that bars transgender officers from conducting pat-downs and using gender-aligned restrooms, citing compliance with President Donald Trump’s 2021 executive order on gender categories.

The Transportation Security Administration, which operates under DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes : male and female. According to internal documents explaining the policy change that The Associated Press obtained from four independent sources, including two current and two former TSA workers, “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveler’s and officer’s biological sex. In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveler elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area.” Until February, TSA assigned work consistent with officers’ gender identity under a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP it rescinded that directive to comply with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order. Related Stories A prolonged US government shutdown could impact your travel plans 4 MIN READ Although transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications,” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents. A transgender officer at Dulles International Airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleges in her lawsuit filed Friday that the new policy — which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity — violates civil rights law. “Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialized certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says. Mittereder declined to speak with the AP but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called TSA’s policy “terribly demeaning and 100% illegal.” TSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “Male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs.” The legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay . Other transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder. Kai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, but retired in July in large part because of the new policy. Regan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021 and said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change. “It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old, who worried that he would soon be fired for his gender identity, so he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop.” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward — a legal organization that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court — called TSA’s policy “arbitrary and discriminatory,” adding: “There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity.” DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory. “Does the AP want female travelers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritize mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travelers.” Airport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H. Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimizing passenger discomfort during screening. Travelers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added. Deciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty,” Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays. “It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said. TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveler should be patted down based on his/her declared sex.” For passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female,” the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex,” and to contact a supervisor if concerns persist. The documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation.” But the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so,” Puth said. According to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public,” the lawsuit said. “This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.” Being unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says. It adds that the ban places additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties. American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley urged TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public.” “This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches.” ________ Associated Press Staff Writer Rio Yamat in Las Vegas contributed to this report. ________ The Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

The brooch, which can also be worn as a pendant, features an oval diamond weighing over 13 carats surrounded by smaller cut diamonds. The sale price vastly outstripped the high end of the pre-sale estimate of 200,000 francs. The hammer price was 2.85 million francs, excluding fees and other charges that were included in the final aggregate price. The circular jewel was found in a stash of Napoleon’s personal belongings in carriages that got held up on muddy roads as he and his troops fled the Duke of Wellington’s British forces and the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher, Sotheby’s said. For more than two centuries, the jewels featured as part of heirlooms of the Prussian Royal House of Hohenzollern. Sotheby’s did not disclose the identity of the seller, and said that the buyer was a “private collector.” Among dozens of lots on the block was a green beryl weighing over 132 carats, which Napoleon was said to have worn at his 1804 coronation.

The auction house said later that the lot had been withdrawn “following discussions with the consignor,” or owner, without elaborating. The gem had been expected to fetch about $20 million.

EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a directive issued last week by the Trump administration. The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a \"public charge\" — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant's health status. The directive is part of the Trump administration's divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House's crusade to push out immigrants has included  daily mass arrests,  bans on refugees  from certain countries, and plans to  severely restrict the total number  permitted into the U.S. The new guidelines mandate that immigrants' health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said  Charles Wheeler , a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group. \"You must consider an applicant's health,\" the cable reads. \"Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care.\" About  10% of the world's population  has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe's  leading killer . The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, such as obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S. \"All of these can require expensive, long-term care,\" the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable. Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government. \"Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?\" the cable reads. The cable's language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department's own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on \"what if\" scenarios, Wheeler said. The guidance directs visa officers to develop \"their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,\" he said. \"That's troubling because they're not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn't be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.\" The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents. \"Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?\" the cable asks. Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, and asked to  fill out a form  that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against  infectious diseases  like measles, polio, and hepatitis B. But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants' medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history. \"Taking into consideration one's diabetic history or heart health history — that's quite expansive,\" Genovese said. \"There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite as expansive as opining over, 'What if someone goes into diabetic shock?' If this change is going to happen immediately, that's obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.\" KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604857","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:55:00-05:00","title":"Google launches a lawsuit targeting text message scammers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Google has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New York targeting a criminal organization known as 'Lighthouse,' based in China, which operates a 'phishing-as-a-service' business by selling fake website templates to scammers.

 By John Ruwitch \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 1:55 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         If you have a mobile phone, you have no doubt seen some dodgy texts. They might declare that you have an overdue road toll, and urge you to \"Click here to pay.\" Or maybe they inform you that there's a package waiting, but the address is wrong; \"Click here to fix it.\" More often than not, these texts are scams. The websites you are directed to are fakes, often decked out with a misappropriated Google logo to trick you into typing in sensitive payment or sign-in information. It's called a \"phishing\" attack — or \"smishing\" when it's done via SMS. And now Google has had it with scammers. On Wednesday, the tech giant went on the offensive, filing a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York targeting what it alleges is a sprawling criminal organization based in China called \"Lighthouse\" that provides software and support to online scammers. The lawsuit alleges that the Lighthouse network runs a \"Phishing-as-a-Service\" operation, selling a software kit that offers hundreds of fake website templates to would-be scammers. Google's suit says nearly 200 of them have mimicked U.S.-based sites, including New York City's official website, the post office and the West Virginia DMV. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel, said over 100 of the templates to make fake websites   have included the company's logos in places where people were directed to sign in or make payments, creating the illusion of legitimacy. \"We are a global company. This hits all of our users,\" she said. \"We're concerned about the damage to user trust and not knowing what websites are safe.\" The Lighthouse network has targeted victims in more than 120 countries, swindling millions of dollars from victims each year, the suit alleges.   Screenshots included in the complaint show that the network apparently misused several other well-known logos, including those of payment, credit card and social media companies. DeLaine Prado declined to put a dollar figure on the damage to Google, saying it was \"a bit immeasurable,\" but noted a stark example of what Google believes to be the reach of the organization. From July 2023 through October 2024, according to the complaint, the Lighthouse network created or used 32,094 distinct phishing websites that mimicked the U.S. Postal Service. DeLaine Prado estimated those sites would \"compromise between 12.7 and 115 million credit cards in the U.S. alone.\" But there's a twist: Google doesn't know the actual identities of the people it's trying to sue. The suit refers to the defendants as \"Does 1-25\" — as in John or Jane Doe. Rather than names, the court filing contains only handles that some of those individuals have used on the encrypted messaging app Telegram to do business.  Plus, they're in China, beyond the reach of U.S. courts. NPR sought comment by messaging several of the Telegram handles that the court filing said were involved in the Lighthouse enterprise. Most did not reply. \"Kun Lun,\" identified in Google's filing as part of the team within the Lighthouse enterprise that helped send out spam texts, said: \"What does this have to do with me? I'm not familiar with this.\"  The primary goal isn't to bring any of these people to trial, DeLaine Prado said. \"The goal is deterrence.\" In filing the case, she said, Google is seeking a declaratory judgment from the court ruling that Lighthouse's activity is illegal. \"It allows us a legal basis on which to go to other platforms and services and ask for their assistance in taking down different components of this particular illegal infrastructure,\" she said, without naming which platforms or services Google might focus on. \"Even if we can't get to the individuals, the idea is to deter the overall infrastructure in some cases.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She said the lawsuit would also help let consumers know to be vigilant about scams. DeLaine Prado said going after scammers is her legal team's \"bread and butter,\" and that while this case is large, it is not unique. \"In terms of litigation, we look for cases where we really think it is ripe for public attention and the investigation yields something where the court can actually help be a shield to protect users,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Google on Wednesday also publicly endorsed three bipartisan bills being considered by Congress that are meant to help law enforcement agencies target scammers. The bills include the  Guarding Unprotected Aging Retirees from Deception (GUARD) Act , which would allow local law enforcement to use grant funding to investigate financial fraud targeting retirees; the  Foreign Robocall Elimination Act , which would establish a task force to block foreign robocalls; and the  Scam Compound Accountability and Mobilization (SCAM) Act , which aims to develop a national strategy to counter \"compounds\" where people are trafficked to work in scam operations. The case comes at a challenging time for Google, which is facing its own legal difficulties. In September, a federal judge  ordered  the company to share search data with some of its competitors. The penalty was based on a previous ruling after the court found the company held an illegal monopoly in its core internet search business. This month, another court  ruled  that Google's digital advertising practices violate antitrust laws. And last week, Google  agreed to a proposed settlement  with Epic Games to end yet another antitrust lawsuit, focused on its Play app store. Google is a financial supporter of NPR. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-illinois-immigration-ice-c24537965e31860fb07ba83e79de4f4b","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:00:28+00:00","title":"Chicago Community Organizes 'Buy Out' Events to Support Street Vendors Amid Immigration Crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a federal immigration crackdown that has led to over 3,200 arrests in Chicago’s metropolitan area, street vendors and small businesses in predominantly Latino neighborhoods have faced extreme fear and economic hardship.

and candy stalls. They buy out every last item — every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need. Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city’s Latino neighborhoods have emptied out . Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home. But as fear spread , so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called “buy out” events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars. In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.

Follow on Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor’s cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them. “This is about food and joy and bike rides,” Rosales said. “But it’s also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.” Street vendors targeted in immigration crackdown It’s hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained. In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city’s streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors.

The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors. Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to “buy them out,” Orozco said. “It’s been emotional to see,” she said. “The vendors themselves didn’t realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.” Communities rally to support restaurants as customers dwindle As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September. So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.

She was used to seeing familiar faces on 18th Street — a woman selling candy with her baby strapped to her back, a paletero who smiled at her each afternoon. Then one week, they were gone. “It broke my heart,” Martinez said. “The streets felt empty. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.” She began raising money online and started “Operation Buyout,” approaching vendors one by one to purchase everything they had. The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500. “I just wanted her to have a day of rest, a day without fear,” Martinez said. Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago. Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they’re sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler. “There is a magic when I’m baking,” he said in Spanish. “I feel free. When I’m angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.” A baker in the historically Mexican-American Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen speaks during an interview at Vault Gallerie, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

For years, he’s sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop. But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels “sick with fear.” “I’m afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. “It would be horrible to leave her. … I can’t see myself without my children.” Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street. The man’s hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry. “Thank you so much,” he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest. “It’s beautiful.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/snap-shutdown-reopening-food-aid-a11b6c83934d9c718cc413fc1f9435d3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:50:30+00:00","title":"SNAP Benefits Delayed Amid Government Shutdown; States Face Uncertainty on When Full Payments Will Arrive","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown has created significant uncertainty about the delivery of SNAP food assistance, with 42 million Americans relying on the program for nutrition.

government, but there’s still uncertainty about when one of the most far-reaching impacts of the closure will be resolved and all 42 million Americans who receive SNAP food aid will have access to their full November benefits. The House on Wednesday adopted a plan to reopen and sent it to President Donald Trump to sign. One provision calls for restarting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but even that doesn’t resolve when the benefits will be loaded onto the debit cards beneficiaries use to buy groceries. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the program, said in an email Wednesday that funds could be available “upon the government reopening, within 24 hours for most states.” The department didn’t immediately answer questions about where it might take longer — or whether the 24-hour timeline applies to when money would be available to states or loaded onto debit cards used by beneficiaries. There has been a series of court battles over the fate of the largest government food program, which serves about 1 in 8 Americans. Here are things to know about how it could go. When SNAP funds become available could vary by state Seesawing court rulings and messages from the USDA have meant that beneficiaries in some states already have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments. States say it’s faster to provide full benefits than it is to do the calculations and computer programming required for partial amounts. At least 19 states plus the District of Columbia issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, an Associated Press tally found. Many of them managed to do it in a day or so, in the narrow window between the Nov. 6 court ruling that required the federal government to make full payments and one Nov. 7 by the U.S. Supreme Court that stopped it . Jessica Garon, a spokesperson for the American Public Human Services Association, said she anticipates most states will be able to issue full benefits within three days after they’re given the go-ahead, but that it might take a week for others. Experts say the states that have sent no November benefits already, such as South Carolina and West Virginia, will likely be the quickest. But there’s a complication. Sixteen states have loaded the EBT cards used in SNAP with partial benefits. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst with the advocacy group Share Our Strength said some of those states might run into technical hurdles to issue the remaining amount. Delays in benefits can be a problem for recipients Even if there’s some clarity that benefits are on the way, exactly when they arrive will matter to millions of Americans. About 42 million lower-income Americans receive SNAP benefits , on average about $190 monthly per person. Many say the benefits don’t and aren’t intended to cover the full cost of groceries in a regular month, even with careful budgeting. It’s worse when benefits are delayed. Doretha Washington, 41, of St. Louis, and her husband have themselves and six children to feed and not enough money to cover that cost. Her husband works servicing heating and cooling systems, but the family still needs SNAP to get by. They had received nothing in November, although Missouri said Tuesday that partial benefits would be issued. “Now it’s making things difficult because we can’t pay our bills in full and keep food in here,” Washington said this week. “I’m down to three days of food and trying to figure out what to do.” She has been rationing what they have. Other people have turned to food charities but are sometimes finding long lines and low supplies. Cutting off funds left state governments scrambling The USDA told states Oct. 24 that it would not fund the program for November if the shutdown continued. That left states scrambling. Most Democratic-led states sued to have the funding restored. Some Democratic and Republican-led states launched efforts to pay for SNAP benefits using state money, boost food banks and deploy the National Guard to help with food distribution. Another group of states used their money allotted for SNAP benefits only after a judge ordered the Trump administration to cover the full cost for the month. The legislation to reopen the government passed by the Senate on Monday calls for states to be reimbursed for spending their funds to run programs usually paid for by the federal government. It’s not immediately clear, though, which situations might qualify in the case of SNAP. In the meantime, the USDA told states Tuesday that it would reimburse them for paying out partial SNAP benefits under a system where recipients get up to 65% of their regular allocations — and even states that paid the full amount can receive partial reimbursements. It also said it would not reduce the amount on cards for recipients in states that paid full amounts. Democratic-led states that sued for benefits to be made available said in a filing Wednesday that the late-arriving information “illustrates the chaos and confusion occasioned by USDA’s multiple, conflicting guidance documents.” ___ Associated Press reporters Margery A.

You may need to rethink your eating habits, say sleep specialists. Noshing on a giant cheeseburger and drinking a boozy cocktail right before bed, for example, may disrupt your nighttime rest. And snacking on a bowl of cherries instead of, say, a sugar cookie, may allow for more restful sleep. \"What you eat, in terms of nutrients, fats, sugar and fiber, can all play a role in sleep quality at night,\" says  Marie-Pierre St-Onge , a nutrition scientist and researcher at Columbia University and the co-author of the cookbook  Eat Better, Sleep Better . We asked sleep researchers to share science-backed dietary practices that improve sleep. Here are their do's and don'ts. DO seek out foods rich in tryptophan   Tryptophan is an amino acid we get from food, and it's converted to serotonin and melatonin in the brain, chemicals in our bodies that play an important role in sleep, says St-Onge. \"Melatonin is important for helping one fall asleep and remain asleep throughout the night,\" St-Onge says. \"Serotonin makes people feel happy and is related to our sleep-wake cycle.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       You can find tryptophan in  almonds, barley, brown rice, chia seeds, lentils, oats, pumpkin seeds, salmon, tofu, turkey, walnuts, white beans and yogurt.  But don't assume that eating these foods will make you instantly sleepy. Tryptophan isn't a sedative, St-Onge says. Work these ingredients into your diet to promote healthier sleep over time. DO swap sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables One of the best ways to improve sleep health is to eat more fruits and vegetables, says St-Onge. \"Add more vegetables to your recipes. Swap more processed, refined food products with a piece of fruit.\" Many fruits and veggies are \"good sources for multiple sleep-supporting nutrients,\" St-Onge says. That includes serotonin, melatonin and micronutrients like magnesium, vitamin B6 and folate, which also help the body to produce melatonin. They're also a great source of fiber.  Through her research , St-Onge has found that people who have high fiber diets tend to sleep more deeply. \"Eventually, [those healthy swaps] will start to take the place of more refined carbohydrates,\" which, along with added sugars, can disrupt your sleep,\" says St-Onge. In  a 2020 study , St-Onge and her colleagues found that \"women who had more refined carbohydrates in their diet and more added sugars had a higher risk of insomnia.\" St-Onge has a list of what she calls \"powerhouse ingredients\" in her cookbook. \"Many of these have studies that support their benefits for sleep,\" she says. Here are just a few: Bananas:  Fiber, complex carbohydrates, serotonin, melatonin, magnesium, vitamin B6 Cherries:  Fiber, complex carbohydrates, melatonin Pineapple:  Fiber, complex carbohydrates, serotonin, melatonin Spinach:  Fiber, folate Tomatoes:  Fiber, complex carbohydrates, melatonin, vitamin B6 DO avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening  If you are in the habit of drinking an afternoon coffee to give you that buzz you need to power through the rest of your day, know that the caffeine will affect your sleep. Caffeine makes you feel alert because it blocks adenosine, a chemical that builds up in the body during the day and makes you feel sleepy at night. Caffeine can also stick around in your body for a while. In  a Life Kit episode , sleep researcher  Matthew Walker  said that caffeine has a half-life of about six hours in most people. That means if you have a coffee, tea or an energy drink at 5 p.m., around half of that caffeine may still be in your body at 11 p.m. And it can actually reduce the amount of sleep you get at night.  One study from 2013  found that consuming 400 milligrams of caffeine ( that's about two energy drinks ) six hours before bedtime reduced total sleep time by one hour. Sensitivity to caffeine varies, but the  American Academy of Sleep Medicine  says to avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening. Experiment with the timing that works best for you. For some people, cutting out caffeine by late morning is best. DON'T drink alcohol right before bed  Some people drink alcohol before bed to help them fall asleep. Unfortunately, alcohol is only a temporary solution, says  Michael Grandner , a psychologist and sleep researcher at the University of Arizona. While alcohol may initially sedate you, \"the pendulum swings in the opposite direction and wakes you up\" as it leaves your system, he says. It makes your sleep \"shallow, choppy and broken up.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you're considering a nightcap in the evening, don't drink it right before bed. Have your little tipple a few hours earlier. You want to give the alcohol more \"time to exit your system,\" says Grandner. If you think alcohol is affecting your sleep, try and cut your consumption in half, says  Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg , a sleep specialist and medical director based in Florida. \"We're not saying stop alcohol completely. Change the timing and the amount a little bit.\" DON'T feast on heavy meals right before bed  Eating a big meal, like a hamburger or a plate of pasta, right before bed can disrupt your sleep, says Abbasi-Feinberg. Digestion slows at night and laying flat after eating can lead to physical discomforts like heartburn and reflux. Put simply, \"you're not supposed to eat and then lay down for hours at a time,\" says Grandner. Stop eating a couple of hours before bed, says Abbasi-Feinberg. \"If your digestion is done, you tend to sleep better.\" It's fine to eat a little snack in the evening, says  Dr. Chris Winter , a neurologist and sleep specialist in Charlottesville, Va. But keep it light: think hummus and chips or a bowl of cereal. The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane. The visual editor is Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

2025-11-12T15:31:47+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein wrote in a 2019 email to a journalist that Donald Trump “knew about the girls,” according to documents made public Wednesday, but what he knew — and whether it pertained to the sex offender’s crimes — is unclear. The White House quickly accused Democrats of selectively leaking the emails to smear the president. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three emails referencing Trump, including one Epstein wrote in 2011 in which he told confidant Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein’s house with a sex trafficking victim. The disclosures seemed designed to raise new questions about Trump’s friendship with Epstein and about what knowledge he may have had regarding what prosecutors call a yearslong effort by Epstein to exploit underage girls. The Republican businessman-turned-politician has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and has said he ended their relationship years ago. The version of the 2011 email released by the Democrats redacted the name of the victim, but Republicans on the committee later said it was Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with a number of his rich and powerful friends. Epstein took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges. The emails made public Wednesday are part of a batch of 23,000 documents provided by Epstein’s estate to the Oversight Committee. Giuffre said Trump ‘couldn’t have been friendlier’ Giuffre, who died earlier this year , long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her. In a court deposition, she said under oath that she didn’t believe Trump had any knowledge of Epstein’s misconduct with underage girls. And in her recently released memoir , she described meeting Trump only once, when she worked as a spa attendant at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, and did not accuse him of wrongdoing. Giuffre wrote that she was introduced to Trump by her father, who also worked at the club. She described Trump as friendly and said he offered to help her get babysitting jobs with parents at the club. Trump “couldn’t have been friendlier,” Giuffre wrote. Other members of Epstein’s household staff also said in sworn depositions that, while Trump did stop by Epstein’s house, they didn’t see him engage in any inappropriate conduct. Republicans says emails released to tarnish Trump White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Democrats “selectively leaked emails” to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.” Trump, writing on his Truth Social platform, said Democrats “are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done” on the government shutdown “and so many other subjects.” “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!” Trump wrote. In July, Trump said he had banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago because his one-time friend was “taking people who worked for me,” including Giuffre. The women, he said, were “taken out of the spa, hired by him — in other words, gone.” “I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people,’” Trump told reporters. Asked if Giuffre was one of the employees poached by Epstein, the president demurred but then said Epstein “stole her.” Shortly after Democrats released the Trump-related emails, committee Republicans countered by disclosing what they said was an additional 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate. Among them were a trove of emails written over several years by Epstein, including many where he commented — often unfavorably — on Trump’s rise in politics and corresponded with journalists. Emails revive questions about Trump’s relationship with Epstein The release resurfaces a storyline that had shadowed Trump’s presidency during the summer when the FBI and the Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing additional documents that investigators had spent weeks examining, disappointing conspiracy theorists and online sleuths who had expected to see new revelations. <!-- The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: -->\nYour browser does not support the <code>iframe</code> HTML tag.

In one 2019 email to journalist Michael Wolff , who has written extensively about Trump, Epstein wrote of Trump, “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” In an April 2, 2011, email to Maxwell, a former Epstein girlfriend now imprisoned for conspiring to engage in sex trafficking, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump. Virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” Maxwell replied the same day: “I have been thinking about that.” Leavitt said the person referenced in the emails is Giuffre, who had accused Britain’s then-Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager and who died by suicide in April. Andrew, who recently was stripped of his titles and evicted from his royal residence by King Charles III after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein, has rejected Giuffre’s allegations and said he didn’t recall meeting her. It wasn’t clear what Epstein meant by saying that Trump was a dog that “hadn’t barked,” but both he and Maxwell in other correspondence accused Giuffre of fabricating stories about her supposed sexual interactions with famous men. Leavitt said in a statement that Giuffre had “repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and ‘couldn’t have been friendlier’ to her in their limited interactions.” “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,” the statement said. “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump’s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.” Messages seeking comment were left with Wolff, Maxwell attorney David Markus and representatives for Giuffre’s family. Maxwell’s interview with the Justice Department Maxwell, interviewed in July by the Justice Department’s second-in-command, repeatedly denied witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions involving Trump. “I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche , according to a transcript of the interview. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.” Giuffre came forward publicly after an initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. He was released in 2009. In subsequent lawsuits, Giuffre said she was a teenage spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago when she was approached in 2000 by Maxwell. Lawyers for Maxwell, a British socialite , have argued that she never should have been tried or convicted for her role in luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison term, though she was moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after the Blanche interview. ___ Sisak reported from New York. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of Jeffrey Epstein at https://apnews.com/hub/jeffrey-epstein ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/jack-schlossberg-house-new-york-jerry-nadler-6c924e46e00fa2ba7df903921f92091b","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"05:24:02+00:00","title":"Jack Schlossberg Launches Campaign to Replace Jerry Nadler in New York’s Manhattan Congressional District","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of President John F.

Kennedy’s grandson Jack Schlossberg is running for the U.S. House next year, announcing Tuesday that he’s seeking a congressional seat in New York City that will be vacated by longtime Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler . Schlossberg, 32, is a sardonic social media personality with a large following and storied political roots. In a video, he said the district covering a core chunk of Manhattan “should have a representative who can harness the creativity, energy and drive of this district and translate that into political power in Washington.” Nadler , who is serving his 17th term in Congress, announced in September that he will not run for reelection next year after decades in office, suggesting to The New York Times that a younger Democratic lawmaker in his seat “can maybe do better, can maybe help us more.” Several possible successors have emerged for the solidly Democratic district, including Micah Lasher, a former aide to Nadler and current New York state lawmaker with deep experience in government. The district stretches from Union Square to the top of Central Park, including the wealthy Upper East Side and Upper West Side neighborhoods. In his campaign video, Schlossberg took aim at President Donald Trump and Republican governance in Washington, saying “It’s a crisis at every level.” “We deserve better, and we can do better, and it starts with the Democratic Party winning back control of the House of Representatives,” he said. Schlossberg has cultivated his online presence with frequent posts weighing in on national political issues, including taking aim at his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , the Trump administration’s health and human services secretary who’s been a vocal vaccine skeptic. Last month, Schlossberg posted on Instagram an image of a Halloween costume for “MAHA Man,” in reference to Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again message and described it as including such things as measles."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:45:35+00:00","title":"U.S. Ends Penny Production After 230 Years in Major Monetary Shift","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States officially ended production of the penny in November 2025, marking more than 230 years of currency history.

(AP) — The U.S. ended production of the penny Wednesday, abandoning the 1-cent coins that were embedded in American culture for more than 230 years but became nearly worthless. When it was introduced in 1793 , a penny could buy a biscuit, a candle or a piece of candy. Now most of them are cast aside to sit in jars or junk drawers, and each one costs nearly 4 cents to make. “God bless America, and we’re going to save the taxpayers $56 million,” Treasurer Brandon Beach said at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia before hitting a button to strike the final penny. The coins were then carefully placed on a tray for journalists to see. The last few pennies were to be auctioned off.

Others pleaded with customers to bring exact change. The more creative among them gave out prizes, such as a free drink, in exchange for a pile of pennies. “We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,” Jeff Lenard of the National Association of Convenience Stores said last month. Proponents of eliminating the coin cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers and the fact that some countries have already eliminated their 1-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012. Some banks began rationing supplies, a somewhat paradoxical result of the effort to address what many see as a glut of the coins. Over the last century, about half the coins made at mints in Philadelphia and Denver have been pennies.

2025-11-12T11:33:30+00:00\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — As Russia’s renewed attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure cause rolling blackouts ahead of winter, a major embezzlement and kickbacks scandal involving the state-owned nuclear power company has put top officials under scrutiny. It’s fast becoming one of the most significant government crises since Moscow’s full-scale invasion, with media reports implicating a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Responding to a public backlash, Zelenskyy called for the dismissal of his justice and energy ministers amid the investigation. They later submitted their resignations, the prime minister said. Anti-corruption watchdogs — the same agencies Zelenskyy sought to weaken earlier this year— revealed the findings of a 15-month investigation, including 1,000 hours of wiretaps, resulting in the detention of five people, and another seven linked to about $100 million in kickbacks in the energy sector. Ukrainian officials are scrambling for European funds to manage mounting energy shortages as Moscow targets critical infrastructure and natural gas production to try to sink public morale. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s outnumbered forces are retreating under relentless assaults in the nearly 4-year-old war.

Military procurement scandals led to the ouster of Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in 2023. But the timing of this one couldn’t be much worse. “Internally this scandal will be used to undermine unity and stability within the country. Externally, our enemies will use it as an argument to stop aid to Ukraine,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy’s party. “It looks really bad in the eyes of our European and American partners. While Russians destroy our power grid and people have to endure blackouts, someone at the top was stealing money during the war.” One lingering question is how high the corruption goes. What investigators found The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, known as NABU, refrained from identifying the suspects but said they included a businessman, a former adviser to the energy minister, an executive who oversaw physical protection at state energy company Energoatem, and others responsible for money laundering. It dubbed the scheme “Midas.” The agency also accused eight people of bribery, abuse of office and possession of disproportionate assets. The investigation, which NABU said conducted over 70 raids, was welcomed by Zelenskyy, who urged officials to cooperate with it. Energoatom says the inquiry didn’t disrupt its operations. NABU released excerpts of tapes in which the network, using code names and secretive language, discussed blackmail and pressuring Energoatom contractors to extract 10%-15% in kickbacks and bribes in exchange for them to do business without facing internal blocks. The network took advantage of a regulation enforced during martial law prohibiting contractors from claiming debts in court from companies providing essential services, such as Energoatom, which has annual revenues of about $4,7 billion. Four others worked to launder the money at a Kyiv office. The tapes, which have not been independently verified by The Associated Press, say about $1.2 million was given to a former deputy prime minister, whom the plotters called “Che Guevara,” after the revolutionary leader. Ministers resign Amid the scandal, Zelenskyy called for the ouster of Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, who also was a former energy minister, and current Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk. Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said they submitted their resignations. She also said the cabinet submitted proposals to apply sanctions against Timur Mindich, a close Zelenskyy associate, and businessman Alexander Tsukerman. “Among other things, this is a matter of trust,” Zelenskyy said in a video on his Telegram channel. That has raised questions about what the country’s highest officials knew of the scheme, especially with war powers concentrated in the president’s office. Zelenskyy tried to curtail Ukraine’s anti-corruption watchdogs last summer but reversed course after widespread protests. Months later, the watchdogs released their findings. A Zelenskyy partner In the tapes, Mindich, 46, a co-owner of Zelenskyy’s Kvartal 95 media production company, is believed to be speaking under the code name “Karlsson.” Under Zelenskyy, Mindich has gained clout and influence in multiple industries, including lucrative domestic drone production. NABU has investigated his alleged connection with Fire Point, a drone manufacturer that has risen to prominence by securing government contracts. NABU investigated the company over concerns it misled the government on weapons prices. “It looks like Zelensky distanced himself from Mindich long ago and when the scandal broke out, Zelensky didn’t start to cover Mindich,” Merezhko said. “But I don’t rule out that someone from his entourage might have succumbed to temptation to make a quick buck.” The AP gained access to the company’s factory in August. Its executives deny connections to Mindich. “The key issue here is that the company supposedly affiliated to Mindich is getting government contracts outside the competition, because of the personal relationship to the administration,” said Ukrainian investigative journalist Yurii Nikolov, who looked into the businessman’s dealings with Fire Point. After his suspension as justice minister, Halushchenko said in a Facebook post that he would defend himself in court. “I believe that being suspended for the duration of the investigation is a civilized and proper course of action,” he said. “I will defend myself in the legal domain and prove my position.” Halushchenko, who was energy minister from 2021 until July when he took over as justice minister, has not been formally charged. “The silver lining in this story is that we have effective and truly independent anti-corruption bodies which have shown concrete results,” Merezhko said. “As it turns out, no one is above the law and no one is immune.” Political analyst Oleh Saakian said the scheme involved “millions, tens of millions of dollars,” but he also cautioned that its full scale is not known. While not the largest corruption scandal in Ukraine’s history, he noted it took place during wartime and is connected to “key players” in the government. Discussions about delays fortifying energy sites In the tapes from NABU, two discussions involved delays to building defensive fortifications for energy sites and waiting for a more profitable alternative before shielding them from Russian attacks. The talk mentioned giving contracts to build defensive protections to a known company, and later to increase kickbacks up to 15%. An AP investigation this year revealed that despite over a year of warnings from Ukrainian officials about vulnerabilities near nuclear sites, the Energy Ministry failed to act quickly. Particularly at risk were unprotected switchyards outside the perimeter of Ukraine’s three active nuclear plants — vital for generating power. Lawmakers highlighted this failure in a resolution calling for the removal of Haluschenko as energy minister and criticized him for alleged corruption and poor oversight. Reactions in Europe Ukraine’s partners have poured money into its energy sector and are likely to look with consternation on the scandal. A spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the government is concerned by the reports of corruption, noting they involve “a sector that receives considerable support from Germany.” The spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, pointed to worries voiced in last week’s report by the European Commission and said Ukraine needs to ensure progress in fighting corruption. “We will now watch developments in this concrete case and, if necessary, consequences will have to be drawn from it,” Kornelius said. But “at the moment we have confidence in the Ukrainian government that it will ensure this be cleared up, and in the anti-corruption authority that it will lay bare this case and it will be brought to a transparent conclusion.” ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1313-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global issues, including Iran’s growing nuclear stockpile amid regional conflict, unresolved justice for Steve Biko’s death, misinformation during the US government shutdown, Amnesty International’s criticism of fossil fuel infrastructure for human rights abuses, a humanitarian pardon for an 81-year-old author prompted by Germany, escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and political debates over healthcare subsidies in the United States.

2025-11-12T07:26:15+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted around their records in a mixed day of trading Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and neared its all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 327 points, or 0.7%, to set a record for the second straight day , while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Advanced Micro Devices was at the front of the market. It rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su said the chip company is expecting better than 35% of annual compounded revenue growth over the next three to five years. She credited “accelerating AI momentum.” Stocks benefiting from the artificial-intelligence frenzy have been shaky recently, as investors question whether how much more they can add to already spectacular gains. Their sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation . Their prices have shot so high , though, that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Nvidia came into the day with a 4.6% drop for the month so far, for example, after its stock price more than doubled in four of the last five years. The biggest player in AI chips swung between gains and losses throughout Wednesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 3.6% for one of the day’s larger losses in the S&P 500.

One way for stock prices to look less expensive is for companies to deliver big growth in profits. On Holdings jumped 18% after the Swiss shoe and apparel company reported a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It reported growth in sales from around the world, with the strongest coming from Asia. But even beating expectations may not be enough for some stocks. Circle Internet Group fell 12.2% even though it reported profit for the latest quarter that trounced analysts’ estimates. The issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies has seen its stock price fall since it got near $300 in June, just a few weeks after its initial price offering of $31. It’s now below $87. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.31 points to 6,850.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 326.86 to 48,254.82, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 61.84 to 23,406.46. Another way for stock prices to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying lower yields can encourage investors to pay higher prices for other kinds of investments. In the U.S. bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.06% from 4.13% late Monday after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Traders still see a nearly 2-in-3 chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. That’s despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a third cut for the year is far from a sure thing. Fed officials are worried about the potential of giving still-high inflation more fuel. The Fed has been in a difficult spot recently because the U.S. government has not been publishing its usual updates on the job market, inflation and other areas of the economy. That’s restricted its view of how things are going, though the nation’s longest-ever shutdown appears to be nearing an end . In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germany’s DAX returned 1.2%, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1% for two of the world’s bigger gains. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/algerias-president-pardons-jailed-writer-boualem-sansal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:19:59Z","title":"Algeria’s president pardons jailed writer Boualem Sansal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Algeria has pardoned Boualem Sansal, an 81-year-old French-Algerian writer, who had been detained for one year on charges of undermining national unity, following a request from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on humanitarian grounds.

Boualem Sansal\n\nAlgeria has agreed to pardon French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, who has been detained for a year on charges of “undermining national unity”.\n\nAlgeria’s presidency announced plans to free the 81-year-old writer on Wednesday, saying President Abdelmadjid Tebboune had accepted a request from his German counterpart to pardon him on “humanitarian grounds”.\n\nSansal, a prize-winning author in francophone North African literature, is known for his criticism of Algerian authorities.\n\nHe was arrested last November after giving an interview in which he said that France had unjustly transferred Moroccan territory to Algeria during the colonial period from 1830 to 1962 – a claim Algeria  views as a challenge  to its sovereignty.\n\nIn March, Sansal was  sentenced to five years’ imprisonment  under “anti-terrorism” laws. He has slammed the case against him as senseless, arguing Algeria’s constitution “guarantees freedom of expression and conscience”.\n\nWhen questioned about his writings during a court session in June, Sansal asked: “Are we holding a trial over literature? Where are we headed?”\n\nSansal’s case has soured relations between Algeria and France, which nosedived last summer when France shifted its position to  recognise Morocco’s sovereignty  over the disputed Western Sahara territory, and which were further aggravated when Algeria rejected French attempts to return Algerians slated for deportation.\n\nWhile France had urged for leniency in Sansal’s case, Algeria was more responsive to the intervention from Germany, whose President Frank-Walter Steinmeier appealed to his “longstanding personal relationship” with Tebboune in issuing the pardon request.\n\nSansal’s daughter Sabeha Sansal told the AFP news agency that she was relieved following the pardon and hoped to see her father soon.\n\nHuman rights advocates in Algeria claim the country has used the  controversial “anti-terrorism” law  employed in Sansa’s case to stifle dissent following the 2019 pro-democracy Hirak protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, Algerian poet and activist Mohamed Tadjadit – who rose to prominence for his public recitations during the Hirak demonstrations – was jailed for five years on charges including “condoning terrorism”. About 20 NGOs, including Amnesty International, have denounced the allegations against him as “baseless” and called for his release.\n\nAlso imprisoned in Algeria is French sports journalist Christophe Gleizes, who was found guilty in June for “glorifying terrorism” after he allegedly communicated with an official of a football club in the Kabyle region who also heads a banned Kabyle nationalist group, according to France’s Le Monde newspaper.\n\nPress freedoms group Reporters Without Borders has called for the release of Gleizes ahead of his appeals trial in December, saying he is “guilty only of practising his profession as a sports journalist and of loving Algerian football”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) opens in Belem, Brazil, with world leaders calling for unity and urgent action to combat climate change.

calls for unity to tackle climate crisis\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations  climate change conference (COP30)  has started in the Brazilian city of Belem, with leaders calling for countries to take a united approach against global warming.\n\n“In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told delegates on Monday.\n\nSome 50,000 people from more than 190 countries are expected to attend the 12-day event, which is being held at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.\n\nAddressing the conference, Stiell said that previous climate talks had helped, but that there was “much more work to do”.\n\nThe UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone.

Afghanistan’s Taliban government in a renewed peace overture, about a week after negotiations between the two sides collapsed in Istanbul, raising fears that a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey could unravel and trigger new border clashes. Shehbaz Sharif made the offer in a televised speech to parliament, a day after a deadly suicide bombing outside a court in Islamabad killed 12 people and wounded 27 others. Seeking peace Still, he said that Pakistan wanted peace in the region, because it was good for both sides, though there were “Afghan footprints” in this week’s attacks. “Let us sit with sincere hearts, rein in terrorism, and work together for peace and prosperity in the region,” Sharif said. He said that during the recent rounds of talks in Doha and Istanbul, Pakistan had only made one demand to Afghanistan: rein in the militants. “We want peace to prevail,” he said, and “Afghanistan should realize that what is good for us is good for them. But it cannot be that they make promises and then fail to act.” There was no immediate comment from Kabul to Sharif’s offer. Growing militancy The latest development came hours after Pakistanis buried their loved ones killed in the suicide bombing at an Islamabad court , as authorities opened an investigation into the assault. The bombing in Islamabad underscored the country’s challenges as the government struggles with a growing militancy , border tensions and a fragile truce with Afghanistan. Tuesday’s attack at the district court, located on the edge of the city, raised alarms that despite multiple operations by security forces to crush the militants, they are still capable of mounting high-profile bombings — even in the Pakistani capital. Pakistan has struggled with a surge in militant attacks in recent years, but until Tuesday’s bombing, Islamabad had largely been considered a safer place. Forensic teams and police were combing Wednesday through debris at the site of the blast, which had been sealed to preserve evidence. Across the city, grief-stricken relatives were receiving the bodies of their loved ones at an Islamabad hospital. Later, funeral prayers got underway for some of the victims. Most of the 27 people wounded in the bombing had been discharged home after treatment. Pakistan’s accusations Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s bombing that the attack was “carried out by Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies” linked to the Pakistani Taliban. He offered no evidence and also said that authorities were “looking into all aspects” of the explosion. India and Afghanistan’s Taliban-led government, which both reject Pakistan’s accusations, have been working to increase ties in areas like business and humanitarian aid, despite not having formal diplomatic relations. Naqvi also blamed the Pakistani Taliban for the attack. Pakistan has long said that the Afghan Taliban have been sheltering leaders and fighters from Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , or TTP — an accusation that Kabul denies. The TTP denied involvement on Tuesday, while a breakaway faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, claimed responsibility, only to have one of its commanders later contradict that statement. The Islamabad attack drew widespread condemnation from the international community. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told Geo News that the Islamabad bombing was “a message for Pakistan” meant to show that insurgents can carry out attacks deep inside the country. Asked whether Pakistan would retaliate and possibly target TTP hideouts in Afghanistan, he said that “it cannot be ruled out” and again urged Kabul to rein in militants operating from there. Attack on military-run college On Monday night, four militants targeted an army-run college for cadets in the northwestern city of Wana. The police said four of the attackers — including a suicide car bomber — were killed and more than 600 people, including 525 cadets, their teachers and other staff, were safely rescued during the overnight assault. The attack unfolded when a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the college gate. Troops quickly fanned out across the campus to prevent the attackers from reaching the buildings where cadets and staff had taken shelter. Footage aired on Pakistani news channels Wednesday showed soldiers evacuating students using wooden ladders and breaking windows to get inside the dormitories. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that the attackers appeared to be attempting a repeat of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre — the deadliest assault on a school in the country — when a breakaway TTP faction killed 154 people, mostly children, at an army-run school in Peshawar. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told a gathering in Islamabad on Wednesday that the two attacks — in Islamabad and Wana — killed at least 15 people. His remark indicated that the Pakistani forces had suffered at least three fatalities at the cadet school. Army chief’s promotion Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday approved a bill to elevate army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created post of chief of defense forces, pending the signature of President Asif Ali Zardari, which is considered a formality. The opposition boycotted the vote, saying the bill could undermine democracy, while the government insists that the new title for the army chief was only meant to ensure better coordination with the navy and air force. Escalation with Afghanistan Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have risen since last month, when Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out drone strikes on Oct. 9 that killed several people in the Afghan capital. The strikes sparked cross-border clashes that left dozens of soldiers, civilians and militants dead before Qatar brokered a cease-fire on Oct. 19. Two rounds of follow-up peace talks in Istanbul ended without progress after Kabul refused to provide written assurances that militants wouldn’t use Afghan soil to stage attacks in Pakistan. The TTP, which is allied with but separate from the Afghan Taliban, has been emboldened since the Taliban 2021 takeover of Afghanistan. As Pakistan’s tensions with both India and Afghanistan remain high, New Delhi and Kabul have upgraded ties. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and acting Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, who obtained a temporary exemption from travel ban under U.N. sanctions, met in New Delhi in September. And last month, India said that its technical mission in Kabul would become a full embassy — the first high-level diplomatic engagement since the Taliban took power. ___ Ishtiaq Mahsud in Dera Ismail Khan, and Riaz Khan and Rasool Dawar in Peshawar, contributed to this story."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known locally as Super Typhoon Uwan, devastated northern Philippines after a previous typhoon, Kalmaegi, caused significant damage.

2025-10-27T07:34:31+00:00\n\nTitle: Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:12:47+00:00","title":"California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom sharply criticized the Trump administration for its absence, calling it a failure of leadership and a sign of disengagement from global climate action.

California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations climate conference (COP30) is underway in Belem, Brazil, with over 50,000 delegates from 190 countries.

(COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/can-pakistan-afghanistan-peace-talks-survive-islamabad-delhi-blasts","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:10:17+00:00","title":"Can Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks survive Islamabad, Delhi blasts?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a suicide blast at Islamabad’s district court on November 11, 2025, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described the attack as a 'wake-up call' and accused Afghanistan of directly targeting Pakistan, calling for a conventional military response.

two hours after a  suicide blast  at the entrance of the district court in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad on Tuesday, Khawaja Asif, the country’s defence minister, called the attack a “wake-up call” and “ a war for all of Pakistan ”.\n\n“The rulers of Kabul can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which, praise be to God, Pakistan has the full strength to respond,” he  wrote on his X account .\n\nAfter a week of deadly fighting on their border in October, Pakistan and Afghanistan had signed a ceasefire agreement in  Doha , with Asif and his Afghan counterpart Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob inking the pact.\n\nBut that was followed by  two unsuccessful rounds  of talks in Istanbul aimed at cementing the ceasefire and turning it into a longer-term pathway for peace between the neighbours.\n\nNow, even as a Turkish delegation is due to arrive in Pakistan later this week to try to salvage those talks between Islamabad and Kabul, Tuesday’s attack threatens to kill the already fragile prospects of any breakthrough, even though the Taliban have condemned the Islamabad blast.\n\n“I should make this clear about Afghanistan,” Asif said, speaking to a local news channel on Tuesday. “ All their wars have been based on insurgency. To counter that, we must rely on conventional war, and Pakistan has a great army.”\n\nPakistan long enjoyed close ties with the Afghan Taliban, and many Pakistanis welcomed the group’s return to power in August 2021.\n\nBut relations have soured, largely over Islamabad’s accusations that Kabul has provided sanctuary to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The Afghan Taliban reject Pakistan’s accusations.\n\nAn armed group that emerged in 2007, the TTP has waged a sustained campaign against Pakistan and is often described as the ideological twin of the Afghan Taliban.\n\nBesides the TTP, Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of sheltering the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the local ISIL/ISIS affiliate, known as the ISKP – even though the ISKP is a sworn enemy of the Afghan Taliban.\n\nThe last two years have seen a sharp rise in violence inside Pakistan. Most attacks have occurred in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, both of which border Afghanistan.\n\nThe assaults have disproportionately targeted law enforcement personnel. More than 2,500 people were killed in armed attacks in Pakistan in 2024, one of the country’s deadliest years in nearly a decade, and 2025 appears on track to exceed that toll.\n\nAside from the suicide blast in Islamabad, a major operation in Wana, the administrative centre of the tribal district South Waziristan, helped avert a potentially catastrophic attack earlier this week. A two-day military operation rescued more than 500 students, teachers and staff, concluding on Tuesday night.\n\nDespite the heightened rhetoric and violence, analysts say the chances of a full-scale conventional war between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain “very slim”.\n\n“Opting for a conventional war against Afghanistan would damage the positive image Pakistan has cultivated over the past few months,” Fahad Nabeel, head of Islamabad-based Geopolitical Insights, told Al Jazeera, referring to Islamabad’s growing friendship with the administration of US President Donald Trump, and Pakistan’s narrative that it is a victim of violence from its neighbours – India and Afghanistan – rather than a trigger-happy initiator of conflicts.\n\nIftikhar Firdous, a security analyst who also co-founded the Khorasan Diary – a security portal that tracks regional security developments – also agreed.\n\nThe arrival of a Turkish delegation, scheduled for later this week, Firdous said, suggests that Afghanistan and Pakistan might be willing to de-escalate.\n\nHe pointed to the Taliban’s condemnation of the Islamabad attack as evidence of “their intention that they don’t want this [peace talks] to collapse entirely”.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Abul Qahar Balkhi, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry in Afghanistan, said that Kabul “expresses its deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding the explosion in Islamabad and the attack in Wana.\n\nRemarks reading attacks in Islamabad and Wana  pic.twitter.com/OWR5pCrCnk\n\n— Abdul Qahar Balkhi (@QaharBalkhi)  November 11, 2025\n\nBut the suicide attack in Islamabad wasn’t the only deadly explosion in South Asia this week. A  car blast in New Delhi  on Monday killed at least 13 people.\n\nIndian investigators have not publicly blamed any entity or state, and say inquiries are ongoing, but have invoked the country’s “anti-terror” law and made a series of arrests.\n\nThis is the  second major attack  on Indian soil this year, following a deadly incident in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, in April that led to a four-day military standoff with Pakistan.\n\nThe Pahalgam assault, which left more than two dozen civilians dead, was blamed by Indian authorities on an allegedly Pakistan-backed group.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has since warned that any further attacks on Indian soil would be treated as attacks by Pakistan.\n\nWhile Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated this year, India, which historically treated the Taliban as a Pakistani proxy and avoided formal contact, has strengthened diplomatic and strategic ties with Kabul, particularly in 2025.\n\nAfghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi made his  maiden visit to New Delhi  in October, which coincided with an outbreak of cross-border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has  accused India  of supporting armed groups targeting Pakistan and sheltering them in Afghanistan.\n\nAfter the Islamabad court blast on Tuesday, Sharif blamed India for both the Islamabad and Wana incidents without presenting evidence.\n\n“Both attacks are the worst examples of Indian state terrorism in the region. It is time for the world to condemn such nefarious conspiracies of India,” he said.\n\nIndia “unequivocally” rejected the allegations, calling them “baseless and unfounded” and accusing Pakistan’s leadership of delirium.\n\nFirdous, who divides his time between Islamabad and Peshawar, said Pakistan has consistently framed the TTP and other groups as proxies influenced by India seeking to destabilise its western neighbour.\n\n“I would not say that Pakistan blamed India directly as such, but they just reiterated its narrative. They have been trying to tell the world that it is Pakistan, not India, which is the victim of terrorism, and that the Afghan Taliban are now becoming Indian proxies,” he said.\n\nWith tensions simmering in both Islamabad and Kabul and aggressive rhetoric being deployed by senior officials, the question persists: Is an all-out war looming?\n\nFirdous does not believe a conventional war is imminent, but warns of a realignment in which Afghanistan, once again, becomes “central to global power games”.\n\nDiplomacy still has a role, Firdous stressed, saying that mediators such as Turkiye and Qatar are urging restraint.\n\nNabeel said that periodic aerial strikes inside Afghanistan remain a plausible military option for Islamabad.\n\n“However, Pakistan will continue to give diplomacy a chance to demonstrate that it has exhausted all possible options,” he said, before it resorts to military strikes."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is experiencing a worsening water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with rainfall dropping 81% below historical averages.

Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/house-to-vote-on-bill-to-end-us-shutdown-why-democrats-are-opposing-it","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:00:24Z","title":"House to vote on bill to end US shutdown: Why are Democrats opposing it?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a stopgap funding bill to end a 42-day government shutdown, which was previously passed by the Senate with bipartisan support including eight Democratic senators.

over the budget has now moved to the US House of Representatives, a day after the Senate cleared a stopgap funding measure to end the longest government  shutdown  in the country’s history, as House Democratic leaders are encouraging members to vote against the bill.\n\nThe Republican-led measure was passed in the Senate on Tuesday with the support of eight senators from the Democratic caucus who broke ranks with the party. The stopgap package, which will keep the government running until January 30, did not include funding for healthcare subsidies – which is at the heart of the political impasse that has gripped the US since October 1.\n\nTop Democrats, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are seeking an amendment to the bill to extend healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which benefits some 24 million Americans.\n\n“We’re not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people,” Jeffries said in a news release issued by his team on Tuesday evening.\n\nIf the Republican-controlled House passes the bill on Wednesday, it will go to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.\n\nSo what are the Democrats proposing, and will the House pass the bill ending 42 days of shutdown?\n\nJeffries and other Democratic lawmakers unveiled a proposed amendment to the bill that would call for a three-year extension of subsidies to the ACA, which is due to expire at the end of the year, to make health insurance coverage more affordable.\n\n“We’re going to continue the fight to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And if it doesn’t happen this week, next week, this month, next month, then it’s the fault of Donald Trump, House and Senate Republicans who continue to make life more expensive for the American people,” Jeffries said on Tuesday night.\n\nThe ACA was first launched in 2010, informally known as ObamaCare, under then-President Barack Obama. While the act affected all aspects of the healthcare system, the main change was the introduction of a regulated health insurance marketplace for those who are uninsured to access health insurance.\n\nIn 2021, then-President Joe Biden expanded the tax credits under the American Rescue Plan Act, an economic stimulus package, which made healthcare coverage more affordable for families and those with higher incomes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, the tax credits were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under the Biden administration. It is those subsidies that will expire at the end of the year unless the Republicans agree to the Democrats’ demands.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday morning, the Republican-majority House Rules Committee voted to reject an amendment to the bill that would later be voted on to extend enhanced healthcare subsidies for three years.\n\nAnd Trump has shown no signs of giving concessions on the issue. Last week, he proposed to send ACA subsidies directly into people’s bank accounts.\n\n“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nIn July, Trump and Congress cut Medicaid funding by $930bn over the next decade as part of his “Big Beautiful Bill”. Medicaid is the biggest government-run health programme and provides care to low-income people.\n\nAccording to the healthcare research nonprofit, KFF, if ACA subsidies are not extended, people who are enrolled in the subsidised programme are estimated to pay “more than double”.\n\nAnnual premium payments for ACA enrollees would rise from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.\n\nChristine Meehan, a 51-year-old hair stylist from Pennsylvania who depends on the marketplace health insurance, told The Associated Press that her $160 monthly plan will increase by about $100 next year.\n\nEight senators, seven Democrats, one independent, defected to vote for the funding bill, which does not include healthcare subsidies. Republicans say the issue will be decided in another vote in December.\n\nThe passage of the bill required Democratic support, as Republicans were seven short of the 60 votes required for the legislation to pass. Democratic Senators Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Jackie Rosen, and Jeanne Shaheen voted along with independent Senator Angus King of Maine.\n\nNow, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is calling for the Senate Democratic leader,  Chuck Schumer,  to step aside after blaming him for allowing the Democrats to cross-vote.\n\n“He’s the leader of the Senate. This deal would never have happened if he had not blessed it. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of other senators who are saying that they kept Senator Schumer in the loop the whole time,” Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told CBS News.\n\n“Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Khanna wrote on X on Monday, joining several Democratic leaders from the progressive and left wing of the party.\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Tuesday that “The American people asked us over and over to fight for healthcare and to lower our costs overall”.\n\n“Obviously, that broke apart at the end. Our job is to deliver for the American people. We need to do that more effectively,” Warren added, declining to say whether she had confidence in Schumer.\n\nSo far, a handful of senators have called on Schumer to resign for allowing the bill to pass on his watch.\n\nIn the compromise legislation passed on Tuesday, it was agreed that all federal workers, who had been working unpaid, would be paid during the shutdown. According to the Bipartisan Policy Centre, a US nonprofit, at least 670,000 federal employees have been furloughed, while about 730,000 are working without pay.\n\nFunding for the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme  (SNAP), which provides food aid for about 42 million Americans, will be extended until next September, according to the bill.\n\nFor air controllers, who are classified as essential workers and did not receive their pay, facing staffing issues that led to 10 percent of  flights  being cancelled, Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said workers will receive 70 percent of their back pay within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThe remaining 30 percent will arrive about a week later, he added on Tuesday.\n\nWith the Republicans holding a slight majority in the House of Representatives, the bill is likely to pass during Wednesday’s vote, which will take place as early as 4pm in Washington, DC (21:00 GMT).\n\nIn the 435-member House, Republicans control 219 seats and Democrats, 214. To pass a bill, a simple majority is needed, which in this case would be 218 votes.\n\nDemocrats are expected to vote against the bill nonetheless.\n\nBefore the vote, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called on Democrats to “think carefully”.\n\n“My urgent plea of all my colleagues in the House – that means every Democrat in the House – is to think carefully, pray and finally do the right thing,” Johnson told reporters.\n\nBut Democrat House Minority Whip Katherine Clark recommended that her colleagues vote ‘no’ to the bill, according to The Hill, a news outlet.\n\n“This does not have to happen to the American people. This is a choice,” Clark told the Rules Committee.\n\n“Democrats have been presenting off-ramps all year. We’ve been giving you a chance to reverse course day after day,” Clarke added.\n\nAfter the bill is approved, it will go to the White House for the president’s signature, where it becomes law and is effective, ending the US’s longest-ever government shutdown."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/india-says-deadly-car-blast-was-terror-attack-by-anti-national-forces","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:25:26Z","title":"India says deadly car blast was ‘terror’ attack by ‘antinational forces’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India has formally labeled a deadly car explosion near the Red Fort in Delhi as a terrorist attack by 'antinational forces', marking the deadliest such incident in the capital since 2011.

inspections of Iran nuclear sites’\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not been able to verify Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium since Israel and the United States struck the country’s nuclear sites back in June, according to a new report.\n\nThe watchdog circulated a confidential report to member states, claiming it had been unable to carry out “long overdue” inspections of seven of the sites targeted in the so-called  12-day war , including major facilities Fordo and Natanz.\n\nThe report, seen by several news agencies, said the watchdog needed to verify “inventories of previously declared nuclear material” to settle concerns over “the possible diversion of declared nuclear material from peaceful use”.\n\nWhile the report criticised Iran’s lack of cooperation, it did say that IAEA inspectors would be visiting the country on Wednesday to conduct inspections at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre site, located some 350km (215 miles) southeast of Tehran\n\nDuring the war, Israel struck buildings at the Isfahan site, among them a uranium conversion facility. The US also struck Isfahan with missiles.\n\nIran suspended all cooperation with the IAEA after the war with Israel, but went on to reach an  agreement  in Cairo at the beginning of September to resume inspections.\n\nBut later that same month, the United Nations reimposed crushing sanctions on Iran, drawing an  angry response  from Tehran and leading the country to halt implementation of the Cairo agreement.\n\nIn August, European powers had reimposed the UN sanctions after Iran failed to enter into direct talks with the US and clarify the status of its near weapons-grade uranium stockpile.\n\nThe US and Israel claimed they attacked Iran because it was getting too close to being able to produce a nuclear weapon.\n\nIran says its aims are entirely peaceful, and the IAEA has said it has no credible indication of a coordinated weapons programme there.\n\nEver since the 12-day war, the agency has been calling on Iran to say what happened to its stock, which is enriched to up to 60 percent purity, a short step from weapons-grade levels of 90 percent.\n\nIran’s near-bomb-grade uranium stockpile was “a matter of serious concern”, said the report. In theory, the stockpile would be enough to produce about 10 nuclear bombs.\n\nWhile some enriched uranium will have been destroyed in the attacks, diplomats say much of the stock was likely stored at a deeply buried facility at Isfahan where the entrance tunnels were hit, but damage appears limited.\n\nThe agency has so far only inspected some of the 13 nuclear facilities that were “unaffected” by Israeli and US attacks.

when they’re killed, when they’re shot, when they’re detained – we can’t get the people what they need to survive,” Pope said.\n\n“The primary issue is ensuring that there is a ceasefire, a humanitarian corridor, so that aid groups can bring in that aid to the civilians who are very much caught in the middle.”\n\nHuman rights groups have accused the RSF, which has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for control of Sudan since April 2023, of  committing widescale massacres  in its capture of el-Fasher on October 26.\n\nWhile thousands of residents remain stuck in el-Fasher, the capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state, nearly 90,000 others have fled since the RSF’s takeover, according to the latest IOM figures.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pope said displaced families have described dangerous journeys out of el-Fasher.\n\n“They spoke about seeing dead bodies as they walked. They spoke about having to create makeshift trenches to avoid being shot at, or being harmed by the drones. They spoke of unspeakable, unbearable, sexual trauma [and] sexual abuse,” she said.\n\n“The stories are really harrowing, and they’re happening now even as we speak.”\n\nHer comments come a day after the IOM warned that humanitarian aid efforts in Sudan were “on the brink of collapse” due to continued insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\n“Warehouses are nearly empty, aid convoys face significant insecurity, and access restrictions continue to prevent the delivery of sufficient aid,” the agency said in a  statement , noting that violence is also spreading to other parts of the country.\n\nNearly 39,000 people have fled intense fighting in North Kordofan state, east of el-Fasher, between October 26 and November 9, the IOM said.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna Mutavati, the regional director for East and Southern Africa at UN Women, told reporters this week that women and girls who fled el-Fasher now face serious threats of sexual violence in displacement camps around the city.\n\n“What the women tell us is that … every step that they’ve taken – to fetch water, to collect firewood, or to stand in a food line – is carrying a high risk of sexual violence,” Mutavati said during a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.\n\n“There is mounting evidence that rape is being deliberately and systematically used as a weapon of war,” she added.\n\n“Women’s bodies … have just become a crime scene in Sudan.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/trump-spent-hours-with-victim-at-epsteins-house-email-alleges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:14:20Z","title":"Trump ‘spent hours’ with victim at Epstein’s house, emails allege","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 2011 email from Jeffrey Epstein alleges that Donald Trump spent hours with one of his victims at Epstein’s house, a claim echoed in a 2019 email stating Trump 'knew about the girls'.

that United States President Donald Trump “spent hours” with one of the victims – an allegation that is likely to further fuel calls for releasing files relating to the late, disgraced financier.\n\nThe  email , made public by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, was sent to Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a  20-year jail sentence  for sex trafficking.\n\n“i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned,” Epstein wrote according to the email, which was shared with the victim’s name redacted.\n\nIt is not clear what Epstein was referring to. The email was sent to Maxwell two years after Epstein had spent 13 months in prison for his sex crimes.\n\nMaxwell responded, “I have been thinking about that…”\n\nIn another email, sent in 2019, Epstein says Trump “knew about the girls”.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Trump dismissed the emails as a “hoax” without addressing their substance.\n\n“The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done  on the Shutdown , and so many other subjects,” he wrote in a social media post.\n\nThe US president also cautioned members of his Republican Parties against focusing in the emails.\n\n“There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!” Trump wrote.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also dismissed the emails, saying that they were “selectively released”.\n\n“The ‘unnamed victim’ referenced in these emails is the late  Virginia Giuffre , who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and ‘couldn’t have been friendlier’ to her in their limited interactions,” Leavitt said in a statement.\n\n“The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre.”\n\nTrump has previously acknowledged that he had issues with Epstein because the late sex offender recruited – or as the US president put it, “stole” – young women who worked at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Democratic Ro Khanna expressed outrage at the “abuse culture” that he said rich and powerful figures, including Trump, engaged in – or at least tolerated – around the late  sex offender .\n\n“This whole Epstein class needs to go,” Khanna told Breaking Points podcast.\n\n“The issue in American politics is from left or right is: Are you for working, ordinary Americans? Or are you for this Epstein class? And this is what’s so important about those emails. It’s not just rich and powerful men who may have abused and raped young girls; it’s a lot of rich and powerful people who knew that the abuse was going on and did nothing about it.”\n\nThe US president had personal ties to Epstein – a millionaire who was connected to powerful figures in politics, popular culture, finance and academia – and later became known for his rampant sex abuse against girls and young women.\n\nEpstein first pled guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution with a minor in 2008 and was given a lenient sentence that critics describe as a sweetheart deal that did not match the severity of the offence.\n\nAfter the Miami Herald investigated the prosecution against Epstein, federal authorities reopened the case against him, arrested him and charged him with sex trafficking of minors in 2019.\n\nTwo months later, he was found dead in his jail cell in New York City. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nEpstein’s associates included former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the United Kingdom’s  Prince Andrew , and former US President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe scandal and the manner in which Epstein died have fuelled conspiracy theories and speculations that he may have been working for foreign or domestic intelligence services.\n\nSome activists – including many Trump supporters – have been calling for years for the release of all government documents relating to Epstein.\n\nBut the Trump administration has refused to make the so-called Epstein files public, citing the privacy of the victims.\n\nEarlier this year, the Justice Department and FBI also dismissed claims that Epstein may have used his sex trafficking operation to blackmail people who frequented his home and private island, reasserting that he  died by suicide .\n\n“Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials and will not permit the release of child pornography,” they said  in a memo  in July.\n\n“One of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bringing justice to victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.”\n\nThe US president also  scolded commentators  who are focused on Epstein, calling the issue a “waste of time”.\n\nBut many of the president’s supporters were not satisfied with that explanation, especially after leaks and allegations raised questions about Trump’s own relationship with Epstein.\n\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal published what it said was a birthday card with sexual connotations that Trump sent to Epstein with a message written inside of a drawing of a naked woman.\n\nTrump denied writing or drawing the card and  sued the newspaper  over the allegation.\n\nIn June, after former White House billionaire aide  Elon Musk  fell out with the US president, he said, “the real reason” Trump has not released the “Epstein files” is that he is mentioned in them."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe geomagnetic storm, rated G4 by the NOAA, is being caused by multiple solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) launched from the Sun between November 9 and 11.

storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nGeomagnetic storms occur when storms on the sun trigger disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field. A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/indigenous-activists-storm-cop30-climate-summit-in-brazil-demanding-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:16:29+00:00","title":"Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including members of the Tupinamba community and participants in the Yaku Mama flotilla that sailed 3,000km down the Amazon River, stormed the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding that climate policies protect Indigenous lands from agribusiness, oil exploration, and illegal logging.

in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the

Iraq’s parliamentary election , according to electoral authorities.\n\nThe Independent High Electoral Commission said on Wednesday that al-Sudani’s Reconstruction and Change coalition received 1.3 million votes in Tuesday’s election, about 370,000 more than the next closest competitor.\n\nSpeaking after the initial results were announced, al-Sudani hailed the voter turnout of 56 percent, saying it was “clear evidence of another success” that reflected the “restoration of confidence in the political system”.\n\nHowever, while al-Sudani, who first came to power in 2022, had cast himself as a leader who could turn around Iraq’s fortunes after decades of instability, the poll was marked by disillusionment among weary voters who saw it as a vehicle for established parties to divide Iraq’s oil wealth.\n\nTurnout was lower in areas like Baghdad and Najaf after populist Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr, leader of the Sadrist Movement, called on his vast numbers of supporters to boycott the “flawed election”.\n\nAs expected, Shia candidates won seats in Shia-majority provinces, while Sunni candidates secured victories in Sunni-majority provinces and Kurdish candidates prevailed in Kurdish-majority provinces.\n\nBut there were some surprises, notably in Nineveh, a predominantly Sunni Arab province, where the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) secured the highest number of seats.\n\nMeanwhile, in Diyala province, which has a significant Kurdish minority, no Kurdish candidates won seats for the first time since 2005.\n\nNo party can form a government on its own in Iraq’s 329-member legislature, so parties build alliances with other groups to become an administration, a fraught process that often takes many months.\n\nBack in 2021, al-Sadr secured the largest bloc before withdrawing from parliament following a dispute with Shia parties that refused to support his bid to form a government.\n\n“None of the political factions or movements over the past 20 years have been able to gain a total majority … that allows one bloc to choose a prime minister, so at the end, this is going to lead to rounds of negotiations and bargaining among political factions,” said Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Baghdad.\n\nThe poll marked the sixth election held in Iraq since a United States-led invasion in 2003 toppled longtime ruler Saddam Hussein and unleashed a sectarian civil war, the emergence of the ISIL (ISIS) group and the general collapse of infrastructure in the country.\n\nThe next premier must answer to Iraqis seeking jobs and improved education and health systems in a country plagued by corruption and mismanagement.\n\nHe will also have to maintain the delicate balance between Iraq’s allies, Iran and the US, a task made all the more delicate by recent seismic changes in the Middle East."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/12/trump-live-us-house-returns-to-washington-for-vote-on-government-shutdown?update=4102904","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:30:40+00:00","title":"House

helix, dies at 97\n\nScientist James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/12/trump-live-us-house-returns-to-washington-for-vote-on-government-shutdown?update=4102953","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:30:40Z","title":"House of Representatives votes to end US’s longest government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives voted to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, resolving a major political crisis.

billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has announced a ban on children under 16 accessing major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, set to take effect on December 10.

online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-12-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00+00:00","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A comprehensive overview of science and technology developments in late 2025 includes a G4 geomagnetic storm watch from the US weather agency, Amazon’s recent workforce cuts, political misinformation from former President Trump regarding Tylenol and autism, Delhi’s experimental cloud seeding for pollution control, Nvidia’s global expansion amid US-China tensions, a major investment deal enabling OpenAI to reach a $500 billion valuation, and promising mRNA-based cancer vaccine research.

2025-11-12T22:54:52+00:00\n\nTitle: How Trump-era funding cuts endanger efforts to empower Haiti’s farmers\n\nOanaminthe, Haiti –  It’s a Monday afternoon at the Foi et Joie school in rural northeast Haiti, and the grounds are a swirl of khaki and blue uniforms, as hundreds of children run around after lunch.\n\nIn front of the headmaster’s office, a tall man in a baseball cap stands in the shade of a mango tree.\n\nAntoine Nelson, 43, is the father of five children in the school. He's also one of the small-scale farmers growing the beans, plantains, okra, papaya and other produce served for lunch here, and he has arrived to help deliver food.\n\n\"I sell what the school serves,\" Nelson explained. \"It’s an advantage for me as a parent.”\n\nNelson is among the more than 32,000 farmers across Haiti whose produce goes to the World Food Programme, a United Nations agency, for distribution to local schools.\n\nTogether, the farmers feed an estimated 600,000 students each day.\n\nTheir work is part of a shift in how the World Food Programme operates in Haiti, the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRather than solely importing food to crisis-ravaged regions, the UN organisation has also worked to increase its collaborations with local farmers around the world.\n\nBut in Haiti, this change has been particularly swift. Over the last decade, the World Food Programme went from sourcing no school meals from within Haiti to procuring approximately 72 percent locally. It aims to reach 100 percent by 2030.\n\nThe organisation's local procurement of emergency food aid also increased significantly during the same period.\n\nThis year, however, has brought new hurdles. In the first months of President Donald Trump’s second term, the United States has slashed funding for the World Food Programme.\n\nThe agency announced in October it faces a financial shortfall of $44m in Haiti alone over the next six months.\n\nAnd the need for assistance continues to grow. Gang violence has shuttered public services, choked off roadways, and displaced more than a million people.\n\nA record 5.7 million Haitians are facing \"acute levels of hunger\" as of October — more than the World Food Programme is able to reach.\n\n\"Needs continue to outpace resources,\" Wanja Kaaria, the programme's director in Haiti, said in a recent statement. \"We simply don’t have the resources to meet all the growing needs.\"\n\nBut for Nelson, outreach efforts like the school lunch programme have been a lifeline.\n\nBefore his involvement, he remembers days when he could not afford to feed his children breakfast or give them lunch money for school.\n\n“They wouldn’t take in what the teacher was saying because they were hungry,” he said. “But now, when the school gives food, they retain whatever the teacher says. It helps the children advance in school.\"\n\nNow, experts warn some food assistance programmes could disappear if funding continues to dwindle — potentially turning back the clock on efforts to empower Haitian farmers.\n\nTransitioning to locally sourced food assistance has been challenging in Haiti largely for the same reason farming is: Buying local produce is often more expensive.\n\nBut many credit Jean-Martin Bauer with helping that shift to happen.\n\nBauer, the director of food security and nutrition analysis at the World Food Programme, was born in the US to a Haitian mother. But he spent part of his teenage years on his uncle's rice farm in southern Haiti, perched at the edge of the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThose early experiences helped spark his interest in food security. But they also opened his eyes to the risks associated with foreign influence in agriculture.\n\nUntil about 30 years ago, Haitians grew most of what they ate: grains, beans and vegetables. For much of the 20th century, agricultural products also encompassed the largest share of its foreign exports.\n\nBut after the fall of the Duvalier family dictatorship in 1986, the US-backed provisional government agreed to lift trade restrictions, including those designed to protect Haitian agriculture.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end for some Haitian farmers. Ten years later, under pressure from the US and International Monetary Fund, Haiti slashed tariffs on rice imports from 35 to 3 percent.\n\n“That’s something that really hurt my family,” Bauer recalled.\n\nHaiti quickly became one of the most lucrative markets for exported US-grown rice in the world. The country was flooded with cheap \"Miami rice\", which outcompeted locally grown grains.\n\nBauer's uncle was among the local farmers harmed by the market upheaval.\n\n“He lost his entire business,” Bauer said. “He lost its customers as a result of the overnight reduction in tariffs.”\n\nForeign aid has also contributed to the competition Haitian farmers face.\n\nCountries like the US have long used food aid as a vehicle to subsidise their own farmers and offload surplus produce abroad.\n\nUntil the mid-aughts, the World Food Programme dealt largely with \"in-kind donations\": shipments of food, other goods and services from donor countries.\n\nBut the UN agency has increasingly called upon its backers to switch to cash transfers, which allow for greater flexibility and the possibility of purchasing directly from local farmers.\n\nThat decision was not without controversy, particularly in countries like the US, which has a strong farm lobby.\n\nCritics have argued that the push for cash could jeopardise support for foreign aid in donor nations. They also warn that purchasing from crisis-stricken areas could have unintended consequences, including driving up costs for local consumers.\n\n\"We cannot guarantee the availability of commodities in foreign markets, but we can guarantee the availability, safety and reliability of American commodities,\" US Representative Bob Goodlatte said in 2007, as he questioned the shift.\n\nBut proponents point out that cash funding allows humanitarian organisations to address the underlying problems behind hunger, including economic instability.\n\n“Feeding people is not so much about dollars and cents and calories,” said Bauer, who led the World Food Programme's Haiti mission from 2022 to 2024.\n\n“It's really about identity. It's about belonging. It's about who you are and enabling farmers to feed their own communities. It's a foundational thing.”\n\nIn Haiti, the World Food Programme's shift to sourcing more food locally began in earnest in 2015 and accelerated in 2021.\n\nWith hunger rising, the UN agency more than doubled the amount of food it procured for Haiti from 2019 to 2024. Local purchases accounted for all of that increase.\n\nFor the 2024-2025 school year alone, the World Food Programme estimated that its Home-Grown School Meals Programme — the initiative Nelson is part of — pumped more than $10m into Haiti's agricultural sector.\n\nOther aid agencies have also started to switch their model of operating in Haiti.\n\nMark Khouri, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Food for the Poor, a US-based religious nonprofit that has worked in Haiti for decades, told Al Jazeera that his group still imports most of its aid.\n\nBut a decision was made five years ago to buy local where possible — at least, when it's not twice the price of imports, he explained. Local purchasing has since increased, but Khouri said that trend could be disrupted if global economic uncertainty drives down donations.\n\nOther nonprofits, like Summits Education, World Central Kitchen and ActionAid, have indicated that local sourcing is a strong priority.\n\nExperts warn, however, that the World Food Programme's efforts to fortify the Haitian agricultural sector have been imperilled by recent funding cuts.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2024, the US — the programme's biggest donor — pledged more than $1.1bn in foreign assistance to Haiti.\n\nBut that support took a hit when President Trump took office for a second term. On January 20, his inauguration day, the Republican leader ordered the suspension of foreign aid.\n\nThen came the cuts. In March, Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced that 83 percent of contracts overseen by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) had been cancelled. The agency itself was later dismantled.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration notified the World Food Programme that it planned to suspend emergency food assistance to 14 countries.\n\nAfter the organisation warned the cuts \"could amount to a death sentence for millions\", much of the funding was restored.\n\nBut the Trump administration has still pushed forward with rescinding $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, much of which was destined for the UN.\n\nThe World Food Programme had faced funding shortfalls before, with contributions lagging behind inflation in recent years, despite rising demand.\n\nBut the growing uncertainty means it will face difficult decisions about how to spend its flexible funding, according to Tanya Birbeck, the World Food Programme's communications head in Haiti.\n\n“Any reduction of funding creates a humanitarian dilemma,” Birbeck said. “WFP is making all efforts to strengthen Haiti’s food systems by supporting local production ... At the same time, needs are rapidly increasing.”\n\nThe World Food Programme has not made public how the latest cuts are affecting their purchasing decisions in Haiti or elsewhere.\n\nSome outside the agency speculate that fewer funds will result in more imported food aid and less local procurement. Others see a decline in both.\n\n“The US funding cuts and the other major Western donor funding cuts severely undercut WFP's ability to deliver food aid, wherever it's been procured,” said Chris Newton, an analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank.\n\n“So those local and regional procurement efforts will necessarily get hit.”\n\nSome experts believe, however, that the full brunt of the US cuts has yet to be felt in Haiti, as organisations draw on existing budgets and emergency funding.\n\n\"I think the big effect is that there's no expectation of future programmes,” said Jake Johnston, who studies foreign aid in Haiti at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\n“I think everyone is responding, even if they haven't faced a direct cut or premature end of a programme. They're adapting to their perceived new reality.”\n\nSo far, the World Food Programme has acknowledged that funding delays have forced it to suspend some operations. No longer can it offer hot meals to Haitians recently displaced by violence, and emergency food rations have been halved.\n\nStill, Birbeck said the World Food Programme plans to forge ahead with its Home-Grown School Meals Programme, with the goal of all local sourcing by 2030.\n\nThis fall, the school meals programme is expected to reach 70,000 more students than last school year, with food from 7,000 additional Haitian farmers.\n\nNelson said being one of the farmers selling to the World Food Programme has changed his life.\n\nWhen school is not in session, his wife typically travels to the local market to sell their produce. But she often cannot compete with the cheaper products from the neighbouring Dominican Republic, so she lugs much of her stock home unsold.\n\nDuring the school year, by contrast, Nelson said his family is guaranteed to make a sale. Through the World Food Programme, his farmer's association provides more than 37 metric tonnes of produce every month to feed about 15,000 students.\n\nBut Nelson wants to go bigger. He is saving to build a new home for his family in a safer neighbourhood.\n\nFor now, though, he is waiting to see whether the school meal initiative does indeed expand, in light of the uncertainty ahead.\n\n“I would like to see the programme last another 15 or 20 years and expand to more schools,” he said. “I would grow more if I knew I could sell more.”\n\nJournalists Alendy Almonor and Makenson Remy contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most energetic flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories. The outbreak, linked to declining vaccination rates due to post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, has led to 5,000 cases and two deaths in Canada alone. This has caused the entire Americas region to lose its elimination status, with 12,596 cases reported across the region as of November 7, 2025, 95% of which are in Canada, Mexico, and the US.

status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:59:31.538+00:00","title":"Starbucks' staff strikes could undermine its turnaround plans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks is facing a significant labor strike by unionized baristas in the US, marking the third major strike since 2021.

working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes.\n\nBut though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround.\n\nPicket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday,   as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing.\n\nThe walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago.\n\nBaristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload.\n\n\"Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,\" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US.\n\n\"You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,\" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May.\n\nStarbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the \"vast majority\" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US. During previous coordinated strikes, fewer than 1% of stores participated, the company said, adding that it expected the same turnout this time.\n\nBut the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment.\n\nIn recent years the brand has faced   consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks.\n\nThe arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%.\n\nHe quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal.\n\nAt the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training.\n\nProgress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat.\n\n\"We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,\" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts.\n\nBut the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester.\n\nStarbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September.\n\nEven after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice.\n\nA union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April.\n\nThe company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would \"significantly affect store operations and customer experience\", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week.\n\n\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement.\n\n\"Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,\" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30.\n\nUnionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months.\n\nThis continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts.\n\nThe brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers.\n\n\"Happy customers have to come from happy employees,\" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. \"You can't do that top down.\"\n\nThis week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of \"union-busting\" and urging the company to bargain in good faith.\n\nJoe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the \"Experience Economy\", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was \"surprised\" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved.\n\n\"This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rj0d97ynvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"23:06:38.542+00:00","title":"What we know about the latest Epstein emails referencing Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major release of over 20,000 pages from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate includes emails that reference President Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Michael Wolff. The emails suggest Trump visited Epstein's home, allegedly discussed with Ghislaine Maxwell, and was reportedly asked to resign from Mar-a-Lago. Michael Wolff, a known Trump biographer, allegedly advised Epstein on how to respond to Trump’s potential involvement, including suggesting he be portrayed as a victim of political correctness. Prince Andrew is linked through a 2011 email forwarded by Maxwell, where he denies involvement. Lord Mandelson, a former UK ambassador, had contact with Epstein as late as 2016.

They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\n\n\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\".\n\nEpstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".\n\nMaxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"\n\nThe victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"virignia\".\n\nThe White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre,  a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year . In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".\n\nGiuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse.  And in a memoir released this year , she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.\n\nAsked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.\n\nIn exchanges with Wolff, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office.\n\nIn a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".\n\nEpstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nWolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"\n\nHe adds, \"of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\n\"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.\n\nA third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.\n\nIn it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\".\n\nEpstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\".\n\nResponding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nAs well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.\n\nHe responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.\n\nAndrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"\n\nMaxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and the then-Prince Andrew.\n\nThe right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.\n\nOn 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.\n\nLord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.\n\nThey show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016 , according to the documents.\n\nThe latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAn email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2015, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".\n\nLord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".\n\nEpstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.\n\nEpstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.\n\nLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d015pz12po","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:21:08.197+00:00","title":"Peru coach crash: At least 37 killed as bus plunges into ravine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic head-on collision on the Pan-American Highway near Ocoña, Peru, a bus operated by Llamosas carrying 60 passengers plunged into a 200-meter deep ravine after hitting a pickup truck on a rugged curve, resulting in at least 37 fatalities and dozens of injuries.

threatening to sue the BBC?\n\nThe BBC is in the midst of a crisis after its director general and head of news resigned, and US President Donald Trump threatened it with a $1bn (£760m) lawsuit.\n\nIt has been under fire after criticism that an episode of the Panorama documentary TV series misled viewers when it edited a speech by Trump, making it look like he was explicitly urging people to attack the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.\n\nBBC chairman Samir Shah has apologised for that \"error of judgement\".   Trump has demanded a retraction, an apology and compensation.\n\nConcerns over the Trump documentary emerged when a leaked internal memo was  published by the Telegraph newspaper .   Among other things, the document also criticised the BBC's reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nThe Panorama documentary in question, called Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast on 28 October 2024, just days before the US presidential election.\n\nIn November 2025, the Telegraph newspaper  published a report , saying it had seen a leaked BBC memo written by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee.\n\nThe memo suggested that the one-hour documentary had edited parts of Trump's speech together, so he appeared to explicitly encourage the Capitol Hill riot of January 2021.\n\nIn his speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nHowever, in the Panorama edit he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nThe two sections of the speech that were edited together were more than 50 minutes apart.\n\nThe \"fight like hell\" comment was taken from a section where Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times.\n\nMr Prescott's memo said Panorama's \"distortion of the day's events\" would leave viewers asking: \"Why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\"\n\nWhen the issue was raised with managers, the memo continued, they \"refused to accept there had been a breach of standards\".\n\nIn a letter dated 10 November to Dame Caroline Dinenage , chair of the House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sports Committee, Samir Shah said the BBC has received more than 500 complaints since the Telegraph's story was published.\n\n\"It has also prompted further reflection from the BBC,\" he said.\n\n\"The conclusion of that deliberation is that we accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement.\"\n\nAfter BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigned, the US president said top people in the BBC were quitting or being fired \"because they were caught 'doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th\".\n\nTrump's lawyers subsequently sent a letter to the BBC threatening legal action, and the president went on to tell Fox News that he felt he had \"an obligation\" to sue the corporation.\n\nThe letter from Trump's lawyers to the BBC demanded that it immediately retract the documentary, issue an apology, and compensate him.\n\nThe BBC was given a deadline to respond of Friday, 14 November, at 22:00 GMT. The letter added that if the BBC did not comply, the president might file legal action \"for no less than $1bn in damages\".\n\nThe BBC has said it will respond in due course.\n\nTrump has signalled an intention to bring any eventual litigation in the US state of Florida, where he has legal residency, rather than in the UK.\n\nThere is normally more \"respect for freedom of expression in the US\" courts, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg told BBC Radio 4. Someone in Trump's position would normally have to show \"that the person you're accusing acted with malice\", he said.\n\nThe president would also have to show that he has suffered some major loss from the programme.\n\n\"So there are definitely restrictions on being able to sue, and arguments that can be put [by the BBC],\" Mr Rozenberg said. \"But I think it's worth looking at what happens in the real world.\"\n\nChris Ruddy, founder and chief executive of conservative US media outlet Newsmax Media, and an ally of Trump, said he was very familiar with Florida's libel laws and is \"very assured\" that the BBC would win if it does reach court.\n\n\"They would prevail because the state of Florida has pretty strong libel laws that defend media companies and free speech,\" he said. \"What's happening is that a lot of media companies would prefer not to go through the media spectacle of all this.\"\n\nWhen faced with legal threats from Trump, other US news organisations have chosen to settle - paying out millions before a case reaches court.\n\nAs part of his case, Trump would also have to show that the relevant part of the Panorama programme was actually available to view in Florida.\n\nThe president's lawyer has said the \"fabricated statements that were aired by the BBC have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums, which have reached tens of millions of people worldwide\".\n\nThe story has been widely reported, and the relevant clip of Panorama has been available online in recent days during the coverage, but there is no evidence so far to suggest that the documentary itself has been shown in the US.\n\nMr Prescott raised concerns about several other elements of the BBC's news output.\n\nHe claimed its reporting of trans issues was effectively \"censored\" by its specialist LGBT reporters, who promoted a pro-trans agenda.\n\n\"I was told that time and time again the LGBTQ desk staffers would decline to cover any story raising difficult questions about the trans-debate,\" the memo said.\n\nAnd he pointed to problems with BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, including a claim that the service's \"story treatment was designed to minimise Israeli suffering and paint Israel as the aggressor\".\n\nOther \"troubling matters\" were raised:\n\nShah said action has been taken to address \"underlying problems\" at BBC Arabic.\n\nHe also said it was \"simply not true\" the memo had uncovered issues the BBC had \"sought to bury\" - nor was it correct to suggest the BBC had done nothing to tackle concerns raised.\n\nTim Davie, who stepped down, was appointed BBC director general in 2020.  Earning between £540,000 and £544,999  a year, he oversees the corporation and is responsible for its editorial, operational and creative leadership.\n\nHe did not directly mention Panorama in his resignation statement, although he said: \"While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision.\n\n\"Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made, and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.\"\n\nHe later told staff that \"we've got to fight for our journalism\".\n\nDeborah Turness, who also resigned, was appointed CEO of BBC News in 2022, overseeing news and current affairs programmes.\n\nEarning between £430,000 and £434,999 , she had responsibility for a team of about 6,000 people, broadcasting to audiences of almost half a billion across the world, in more than 40 languages.\n\nIn her statement, Turness said: \"The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC - an institution that I love.\n\n\"As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me - and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the director general last night.\"\n\nShe added: \"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.\"\n\nTim Davie has weathered many scandals and crises during his five years leading the BBC.\n\nThese include:\n\nDavie's resignation comes at a sensitive time for the BBC, with the government set to review the corporation's Royal Charter before the current term expires in 2027.\n\nThe charter is the constitutional basis for the BBC which sets out the corporation's \"Object, Mission and Public Purpose\".\n\nThe charter review also includes reviewing how the BBC is funded.\n\nCurrently, the BBC is largely funded through an  annual licence fee  that is charged to all British households that watch or record live TV, watch programmes live on streaming services, and use iPlayer.\n\nFunding from the licence fee is used to produce TV, radio and online programmes  for the BBC, as well as to fund the BBC World Service, the Welsh language TV channel S4C, and Local Democracy Reporters.\n\nThe licence fee is supplemented by commercial incomes and other activities such as grants, royalties and rental income.\n\nThe director general is appointed by the BBC Board, which is responsible for ensuring it delivers the corporation's mission and public purposes.\n\nThe BBC Board is led by chair Samir Shah who is one of 10 non-executive members, plus four executive members, including the director general.\n\nDavie's successor will be the 18th director general in the BBC's 103-year history.\n\nNames who have been rumoured as potential contenders include Charlotte Moore, the BBC's recently-departed chief content officer who was in charge of all programming except news.\n\nOther names include Jay Hunt, one of the most experienced executives in British TV, and James Harding, the BBC's head of news from 2013 to 2018."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

2025-11-07T07:49:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdyx6505do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:45:08.436+00:00","title":"Colombian military attack on suspected rebel camp leaves 19 dead","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a military operation in Guaviare province, Colombia's defense forces conducted an air strike targeting a dissident faction of the Farc led by Iván Mordisco, resulting in at least 19 deaths.

attack on suspected rebel camp leaves 19 dead\n\nAt least 19 people have been killed in an air strike on a suspected rebel camp in Colombian province of Guaviare, according to the country's military.\n\nThe attack targeted a dissident faction of the Farc rebel group, which engages in drug trafficking.\n\nColombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, had in the past been reluctant to use air strikes to hit rebel camps but following the breakdown of peace talks with several of Colombia's armed groups, he gave the green light for the military offensive.\n\nThe air strike comes after the Trump administration accused Petro of allowing the drugs trade to expand, which the Colombian president has denied.\n\nColombian Defence Minister Pedro Sánchez said that President Petro had authorised the air strike after learning of \"the imminent threat [the group] posed to the population and the security forces\".\n\nSánchez said that the camp belonged to members of a dissident group led by a commander known by the alias of Iván Mordisco.\n\nMordisco once formed part of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) but broke away from the rebel group as it negotiated a peace deal with the government, which he did not support.\n\nHe is considered to be the most powerful dissident rebel leader in Colombia, whose group engages in illegal mining and extortion as well as drug trafficking.\n\nDefence Minister Sánchez described Mordisco as \"one of the most dangerous criminals and drug traffickers\" in the country.\n\nDuring the military operation, the security forces also detained three people and freed three children who had been recruited by the group.\n\nThe forced recruitment of children by armed groups has been on the rise in recent years in Colombia according to rights groups, which have documented how children as young as nine are kidnapped, or lured away from their parents with false promises.\n\nAfter Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president, was sworn in, he opened peace talks with a number of armed groups in an attempt to make good on his campaign promise to bring \"total peace\" to the country.\n\nMordisco's group was one of those that entered into talks, but they broke down  after six months when Mordisco led a walk-out.\n\nThe government blames the group for a deadly explosive attack on a military facility in the city of Cali in August.\n\nFollowing that explosion, Petro described Mordisco as \"a drug trafficker disguised as a revolutionary\".\n\nPetro is under pressure by the United States to combat drug trafficking.\n\nColombia is the world's biggest producer of cocaine and the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Petro \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity\".\n\nLast month, the US government imposed financial sanctions on the Colombian president.\n\nPetro in turn has accused the United States government of \"murder\" over the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific allegedly carrying drugs.\n\nOn Tuesday, he again expressed his opposition to the US strikes - in which at least 76 people have been killed - and ordered his government to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies.\n\nIn his post on X, he said that \"the fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\"."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How

weapons testing, prompting concern over a possible return to explosive nuclear detonations. However, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that the planned tests are 'noncritical' and do not involve nuclear explosions. These tests will focus on components of nuclear weapons to ensure safety and reliability, using advanced simulations and subcritical experiments with plutonium. Experts, including Georgia Cole of Chatham House and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), emphasize that the U.S. does not require explosive testing to maintain a safe and effective stockpile, which has been assessed as secure since 1992. While Trump claims China is rapidly building its arsenal and will match the U.S. within five years, there is no credible evidence that any country—Russia, China, Pakistan, or India—is currently conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only known 21st-century test was by North Korea, which has since declared a moratorium. Experts warn that resuming full explosive nuclear testing by the U.S. would dangerously escalate tensions and prompt retaliatory actions from Russia and China, potentially collapsing the 30-year global nuclear testing moratorium.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e31p3p3zno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:25:48.066+00:00","title":"Adele to make acting debut in new Tom Ford film Cry to Heaven","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Adele is set to make her film debut in 'Cry to Heaven', a new movie directed by Tom Ford, which is adapted from Anne Rice's 1982 novel about castrati singers in 18th century Venice.

group  The Rights Alliance (TRA) , his subreddit had more than 6,000 members and users were encouraged to request for clips of specific actors.\n\nIn 2023, campaigners reported the case to the police on behalf of the affected actors, directors and producers, which led to the subreddit being closed down.\n\nAndrea Vagn Jensen, one of the actresses whose explicit scenes were shared in the group,  told the Danish broadcaster DR at the time  she felt there was a difference between appearing naked in a film and appearing on Reddit.\n\nThe actress said the posts amounted to \"abuse\".\n\nThe man was arrested in September 2024 and pleaded guilty to the charges last month.\n\nIn a statement following the verdict, TRA head Maria Fredenslund said the ruling sent an \"important\" signal \"that violations of artists' rights has consequences\".\n\nThe ruling is considered unique in Denmark for its use of the \"moral rights\" section of the Danish Copyright Act, which states an artist's work cannot be used in a way which infringes upon their reputation.\n\nCopyright law expert Dr Alina Trapova told the BBC the case was \"rare\" for its focus on the damage to the integrity of an artist, rather than to them economically.\n\nHow the case could affect other countries is unclear.\n\nBut she said there may be \"more and more of these actions\" in the future with the growth of artificial intelligence, where \"the integrity of one's work might be tempered with much more easily\".\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.\n\nItalians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.\n\nThe Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.\n\nDifferent rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.\n\nMore than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.\n\nYugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.\n\nSimilar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.\n\nThe charge is murder.\n\nThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.\n\nThe response from Sismi came a couple of months later, he said. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\n\n\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told, according to Ansa news agency. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.\n\nEzio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.\n\nHe returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.\n\nGavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.\n\nAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.\n\nSpeaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.\n\nIn 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun.\n\nHe was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague.\n\nLimonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling him: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"\n\nItalian prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.\n\nHowever, members of the British forces who served in Sarajevo in the 1990s have told the BBC that they never heard of any so-called \"sniper tourism\" during  the Bosnian conflict.\n\nThey indicated that any attempts to bring in people from third countries who had paid to shoot at civilians in Sarajevo would have been \"logistically difficult to accomplish\", due to the proliferation of checkpoints.\n\nBritish forces served both inside Sarajevo and in the areas surrounding the city, where Serb forces were stationed and they saw nothing at the time to suggest that \"sniper tourism\" was taking place.\n\nOne soldier described the allegations that foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians as an \"urban myth\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv22qjq8eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"23:01:22.448+00:00","title":"Suneung: Blind students sit 13-hour college entry exam in South Korea","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the extreme challenges faced by blind students in South Korea during the Suneung college entrance exam, which they take for up to 13 hours due to the conversion of test materials into braille.

13-hour college entry exam in South Korea\n\nEvery November, South Korea comes to a standstill for its infamous college entrance exam.\n\nShops are shut, flights are delayed to reduce noise, and even the rhythm of the morning commute slows down for the students.\n\nBy late afternoon, most test-takers walk out of school gates, exhaling with relief and embracing the family members waiting outside.\n\nBut not everyone finishes at that hour. Even once darkness has fully settled and night has set in, some students are still in the exam room - finishing close to 10pm.\n\nThey are the blind students, who often spend more than 12 hours taking the longest version of the Suneung.\n\nOn Thursday, more than 550,000 students across the country will sit for the Suneung - an abbreviation for College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in Korean. It is the highest number of applicants in seven years.\n\nThe test not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can affect their job prospects, income, where they will live and even future relationships.\n\nDepending on their subject choices, students answer roughly 200 questions across Korean, mathematics, English, social or natural sciences, an additional foreign language, and Hanja (classical Chinese characters used in Korean).\n\nFor most students, it is an eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams. They begin the Suneung test at 08:40 and finish around 17:40.\n\nBlind students with severe visual impairments, however, are given 1.7 times the standard testing duration.\n\nThis means that if they take the additional foreign language section, the exam can finish as late as 21:48 - nearly 13 hours after it began.\n\nThere is no dinner break; the exam continues straight through.\n\nThe physical bulk of the braille test papers also contributes to the length.\n\nWhen every sentence, symbol and diagram is converted into braille, each test booklet becomes six to nine times thicker than the standard equivalent.\n\nAt Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Han Donghyun is among the students who will take the longest version of the Suneung this year.\n\nLast year, there were 111 blind test-takers nationwide - 99 with low vision and 12 with severe visual impairments like Dong-hyun - according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation.\n\nDong-hyun was born completely blind and cannot distinguish light.\n\nWhen the BBC met him at his school on 7 November, his fingers moved quickly across a braille practice booklet of past exam questions.\n\nWith just a week left before the test, he was focused on managing his stamina and condition. Dong-hyun will take the exam using braille test papers and a screen-reading computer.\n\n\"It's really exhausting because the exam is so long,\" he said. \"But there's no special trick. I just follow my study schedule and try to manage my condition. That's the only way.\"\n\nDong-hyun said the Korean language section is particularly difficult for him.\n\nA standard test booklet for that section is about 16 pages - but the braille version is roughly 100 pages long.\n\nEven with screen-reading software, spoken information disappears as soon as it is heard, unlike text that can be seen and re-read. Dong-hyun has to hold the details in his memory as he goes.\n\nThe mathematics section is no easier.\n\nHe must interpret complex graphs and tables that have been converted into braille, using only his fingertips.\n\nStill, he noted that things are better than they used to be. In the past, students had to do almost all calculations in their heads. But since 2016, blind test-takers have been allowed to use a braille notetaker, known as Hansone.\n\n\"Just like sighted students write out their calculations in pencil, we enter them in braille on the Hansone to follow the steps,\" he said.\n\nAnother student at Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Oh Jeong-won, who will also sit the Suneung this year, said the late afternoon is \"the hardest point\" of the day.\n\n\"Up until lunch, it's manageable,\" he said. \"But around 4 or 5pm, after English and before Korean History, that's when it gets really tough.\n\n\"There's no dinner break,\" he explained. \"We're solving problems during the time we would normally eat, so it feels even more exhausting. Still, I keep going because I know there will be a sense of accomplishment at the end.\"\n\nFor Jeong-won, the fatigue is compounded by the need to stay intensely focused with both his hands and his hearing.\n\n\"When I'm reading the braille with my fingers and also taking in information through audio, it feels much more tiring than it does for sighted students,\" he said.\n\nBut the students say that the length of the exam and the long study hours are not the hardest part. What is most challenging is access to study materials.\n\nPopular textbooks and online lectures that sighted students rely on are often out of reach.\n\nThere are very few braille versions, and converting materials into audio requires having text files - which are difficult to obtain. In many cases, someone has to manually type out entire workbooks to make them usable.\n\nOnline lectures also pose difficulties, as many instructors explain concepts using visual notes, diagrams and graphics on screen, which cannot be followed through audio alone.\n\nOne of the most significant barriers, however, is the delay in receiving braille versions of the state-produced EBS preparation books - a core set of materials closely linked to the national exam.\n\nBecause of this delay, blind students often receive the materials months later than others.\n\n\"Sighted students get their EBS books between January and March and study them for the whole year,\" said Jeong-won. \"We receive the braille files only around August or September, when the exam is just a few months away.\"\n\nDong-hyun shared the same concern.\n\n\"The braille materials weren't completed until less than 90 days before the exam,\" he said. \"I kept wishing the publication process could be faster.\"\n\nThe National Institute of Special Education, which produces the braille version of EBS exam materials, told the BBC that the process takes at least three months for each book because it must follow relevant guidelines.\n\nThe institute added that it is \"making various efforts to ensure that blind students can study without disruption, such as producing and providing the materials in separate volumes.\"\n\nThe Korean Blind Union said it has long raised this issue with authorities, and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding greater accessibility to braille versions of all textbooks.\n\nFor these students, the Suneung is not just a college entrance exam - it's proof of the years they have endured to get where they are.\n\nJeong-won described the exam as \"perseverance.\"\n\n\"There's almost nothing you can do in life without perseverance,\" he said. \"I think this time is a process of training my will.\"\n\nTheir teacher, Kang Seok-ju, watches students go through the exam every year - and said the blind students' endurance is \"remarkable\".\n\n\"Reading braille means tracing raised dots with your fingertips. The constant friction can make their hands quite sore,\" he pointed out. \"But they do it for hours.\"\n\nMr Kang urged his students to value completion rather than regret.\n\n\"This exam is where you pour everything you've learned since the first grade into a single day,\" he said. \"Many students feel disappointed afterwards, but I just want them to leave knowing they did what they could.\n\n\"The exam is not everything.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vw62j3g9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:33:27.949+00:00","title":"Major corruption scandal engulfs top Zelensky allies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major corruption scandal has erupted in Ukraine, implicating top government officials including Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, who have resigned amid allegations of receiving kickbacks from contractors building fortifications on energy infrastructure.

major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on

Enerhoatom.\n\nSome of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.\n\nThe allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.\n\nAmong those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country.\n\nHalushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government.\n\nAccording to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.\n\nThe anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.\n\nNabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.\n\nThe scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\n\nIt will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created.\n\nIn July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption.\n\nKyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.\n\nThe backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.\n\nYet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms.

to champion\n\nThe woman standing on stage glistens in a crystal-studded bikini.\n\nHer glowing, tanned skin shows off each of her well-defined muscle lines, the result of hours of weight training in the gym.\n\nRoya Karimi's perfectly-applied make-up and hair highlighted blonde wouldn't look out of place in the finals of Miss Universe.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that just 15 years ago, she was a teenage mother in Afghanistan, married off as a child bride, before she escaped to her new life.\n\nNow aged 30, she is one of Europe's top bodybuilders, and will be competing in the World Bodybuilding Championships this week. Her rise has been meteoric – she only took up the sport professionally less than two years ago.\n\nNone of this looked likely when Roya fled Afghanistan with her mother and young son. Back then, she sought refuge in Norway where she made a new life for herself, continuing her education and becoming a nurse, while meeting her new husband, who also bodybuilds.\n\nBodybuilding helped her break free from the mental and social limitations that had been imposed on her for years, she says.\n\n\"Every time I go to the gym, I remember that there was a time in Afghanistan when I wasn't even allowed to exercise freely,\" Roya told BBC News Afghan.\n\nRoya's life story has been one of fighting against restrictive traditions and rebuilding her identity - and trying to inspire women in her home country who face widespread restrictions.\n\nSome of those restrictions existed when Roya lived in Afghanistan - a result of social norms. But they have got worse since 2021, when the Taliban returned to power. Now, women in Afghanistan are banned from attending school beyond the age of 12, getting most jobs, unable to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and required not to raise their voices in public.\n\n\"I was lucky to be able to get out of that situation, but many women still don't have their most basic human rights, such as education. It's really sad and heartbreaking,\" says Roya.\n\nBut years before the Taliban returned to power, Roya decided she \"didn't want that life\".\n\nHer decision to flee Afghanistan in 2011, leaving her then husband behind, carried many risks for a woman in traditional Afghan society. It is not a time she likes to remember - and does not want to talk about it.\n\nIn Norway, Roya faced a completely different environment. She had to adapt to a new, more liberal culture, find a job to support herself and her family and learn Norwegian.\n\nIt was difficult to juggle all the demands in the early days, but her efforts eventually paid off.\n\nRoya studied nursing and worked at a hospital in the capital, Oslo.\n\nRoya's introduction to bodybuilding was the next turning point in her life. Attending gyms wasn't just about physical exercise; it was also a way to rebuild her self-confidence and redefine her personal identity.\n\nIt was also where she met her second husband, fellow Afghan Kamal Jalaluddin.\n\nHe had a long history in bodybuilding and is one of Roya's main supporters.\n\n\"Before I met Kamal, I was doing sports, but not at a professional level,\" she explained.\n\n\"His support gave me the courage to choose a competitive and taboo-breaking path. I believe that if a man stands by a woman, amazing things can happen.\"\n\nEighteen months ago, Roya decided to leave her nursing career and enter the world of bodybuilding professionally.\n\nIt was a risky decision, although the main challenge for her was not changing jobs. Instead, she said it was more about adapting to freedoms after the restraints she had experienced in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Our biggest challenge was to break through the boundaries and frameworks that others had set for us - the unwritten rules that were imposed on us in the name of tradition, culture, religion or whatever,\" she said. \"But when you decide to innovate, you have to free yourself from those frameworks.\"\n\nIt has also not come without its problems.\n\nThe bikinis, flowing hair and heavy make-up she wears on stage are a million miles away from the social norms - and now official restrictions - which dictate how women dress and present themselves in her home country.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising then that her social media accounts have been bombarded with criticism, often including threats of violence and even death.\n\nShe dismisses the comments.\n\n\"People only see my appearance and my bikini. But behind this appearance, there are years of suffering, effort and perseverance. These successes have not come easily.\"\n\nBut social media is far from a negative for Roya: it allows her to speak to women back in Afghanistan, talking to them about the importance of physical health, self-confidence and rebuilding one's identity.\n\nNow Roya is preparing to compete in the International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation championships - which start on Thursday in Barcelona - where she is hoping to build on successes she had earlier this year.\n\nShe won gold in the Wellness category at the Stoperiet Open bodybuilding competition in April - a category which places special emphasis on natural fitness, healthy appearance and unobtrusive beauty, rather than large muscle mass.\n\nHer victory was quickly followed by another at the prestigious Norway Classic 2025, which attracts athletes from all over Scandinavia.\n\nFrom there, it was onto the European championships - which clinched her a spot in the world championships.\n\n\"I feel a deep sense of happiness, pride and honour within me,\" she said as she prepared to compete in the Spanish city. \"It's been an incredibly tough journey throughout the year, but step by step, I managed to achieve gold medals along the way.\"\n\nFrom the sidelines, her husband and son are always cheering her on.\n\n\"Seeing Roya on stage was the fulfilment of a dream we built together,\" enthuses Kamal.\n\nBut for Roya, this contest in particular is for more than just her and her family.\n\n\"I feel mentally strong and fully ready to give my all, hoping to make history by setting this record in the name of Afghan girls and women for the very first time.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8392vx8plo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"16:20:09.780+00:00","title":"US ends penny-making run after more than 230 years","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is ending the production of pennies after more than 230 years, with the Philadelphia Mint producing the final batch on Wednesday.

more than 230 years\n\nThe US is set to make its final penny.\n\nThe Philadelphia Mint will strike its last batch of one-cent coins on Wednesday, after more than 230 years of production.\n\nThe coins will remain in circulation but the phase-out has already prompted businesses to start adjusting prices, as they say pennies are becoming harder to find.\n\nThe government says the move will save money, or as President Donald Trump put it in February when he first announced the plans: \"Rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time\".\n\nPennies, which honour Civil War president Abraham Lincoln and are made of copper-plated zinc, today cost nearly four cents each to make — more than twice the cost of a decade ago, according to the Treasury Department. It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year.\n\nOfficials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot.\n\nThe Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, \"far exceeding the amount needed for commerce\".\n\nMany pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in,  according to a 2022 government analysis .\n\nBut penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One  study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve  estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.\n\nOther countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006.\n\nThe UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn.\n\nBut the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.\n\nIn the US attention has now turned to the nickel, which has a face value of five cents but costs nearly 14 cents to produce.\n\nRetiring that coin would have a far bigger impact on shoppers, costing consumers some $55m per year, according to the Richmond Fed study."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c231y3dm8jko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:48:06.260+00:00","title":"Fifty-year mortgages and $2,000 cheques: What's behind Trump's affordability drive?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump is pushing a series of proposals to address public concerns about economic affordability, including a $2,000 cash rebate funded by tariff revenue, promoting 50-year mortgages to reduce housing costs, and converting expiring health insurance subsidies into direct payments.

2025-11-12T15:48:06.260+00:00\n\nTitle: Fifty-year mortgages and $2,000 cheques: What's behind Trump's affordability drive?\n\nFacing growing public pessimism about his handling of the economy, US President Donald Trump has fired off a flurry of proposals to address consumer concerns.\n\nTrump previously downplayed concerns about cost of living, insisting the outlook had improved during his nine months in office. He said affordability was a \"new word\", and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nBut he has focused on the issue with some urgency since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's off-year elections across a handful of states.\n\nHe is again proposing an idea to give most Americans a $2,000 (£1,500) \"subsidy\".\n\nIn reality the payments would operate more like a rebate for federal revenue generated by his tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nThe rest of the tariff revenue, he has said, would go to reducing the federal budget deficit.\n\nAccording to economists, however, the tariff revenue isn't nearly enough to cover the $2,000 rebate plan, even with the most generous assumptions and a narrow definition of those with incomes to qualify.\n\n\"If we take something like a cut-off of $100,000 a year in income, the minimum cost would be about $300bn, which would absorb all of the tariff revenue that's been taken in so far and would require some deficit financing,\" says Erica York, vice-president of tax policy at the non-partisan Tax Foundation.\n\nWhat's more, according to Ms York, the tariff refunds might end up being counterproductive by driving up prices as more money is pushed into the American economy. Covid-era stimulus payments may have created a similar dynamic, albeit in a larger scale.\n\n\"It would give large sums of money to households who are more likely to consume that than save it,\" she said. \"So we would have more dollars chasing goods in the economy.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seemed to downplay the possibility of such payments, saying that the revenue gains from the tariffs would be reflected in lower tax rates paid by Americas next year under the provisions of Trump's 2025 \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" spending package, which Congress passed in July.\n\nIn last week's elections, when Democrats notched up a string of victories, exit polls indicated the economy once again led all issues as the subject of concern for American voters.\n\nZohran Mamdani made affordability the key to his successful campaign for New York City mayor, as did Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey with their winning runs for governor.\n\nThe exit poll results match recent opinion surveys that have suggested the public is souring on Trump's handling of the economy and his inability, in their view, to follow through on campaign promises to lower costs for American consumers.\n\nAnother of Trump's ideas involves promoting 50-year mortgages – an alternative to the 30-year mortgages that are standard for American home purchases.\n\nThe president has touted the extended payment schedule as a way to make home ownership easier for Americans.\n\nMany in his own party, however, view it as a boon for lenders who will collect bigger fees and more interest.\n\n\"I don't like 50-year mortgages as the solution to the housing affordability crisis,\" Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X.\n\n\"It will ultimately reward banks, mortgage lenders and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home.\"\n\nTrump appears to have floated this idea without consulting senior White House advisers – a reflection of his willingness to move quickly on new ideas, but with the risk of giving his advisers little time to offer input.\n\nTrump has also suggested taking government health insurance subsidies that will expire at the end of the year – which Democrats have unsuccessfully fought to extend during the 43-day government shutdown – and turning them into direct cash payments to consumers.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News, the president said this would allow American consumers to be more like \"entrepreneurs\" and \"go out and negotiate their own insurance\".\n\nAll of these proposals would likely require congressional implementation, which is far from guaranteed with narrow Republican majorities in both chambers.\n\nTrump has broached other, more modest proposals for reducing costs, such as ordering a federal investigation into beef prices and reaching an agreement with pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower the price of obesity drugs for uninsured buyers.\n\n\"It feels right now they're just throwing all sorts of ideas out there to test them to see if they sound good,\" says Ms York.\n\nTrump's electoral success – his ability to challenge long-held conservative orthodoxy and overcome seemingly formidable public concerns - demonstrate his well-tuned political instincts.\n\nWhen he has sensed vulnerability in the past, he's frequently used his political rallies and public appearances to sound out new ideas and gauge popular support.\n\nBut this is harder to do from the confines of the Oval Office, which is why the White House is discussing whether he should travel the country to give speeches on the economy, according to CNN.\n\nSome of Trump's other actions risk undermining his attempts at recalibrating his policies to reflect a darkening public mood.\n\nFor instance, Trump continues to insist that prices are dropping. In some cases – such as eggs and dairy products – he's right.\n\nBut in others – those aforementioned beef, as well as coffee and electricity – costs are on the rise.\n\nThe president has repeatedly noted that the price of a Thanksgiving meal at Walmart is less than last year.\n\nBut he doesn't mention that the retail chain's dinner package this season contains half as many items and a smaller turkey.\n\nAll the while, his administration has fought in court to end food aid during the government shutdown, and the president has relentlessly touted the multi-billion-dollar renovations he's overseeing to the White House.\n\nFour years ago, Joe Biden's White House was insisting that the economy was strong even as post-Covid consumer costs spiralled higher.\n\nFor the next three years of his administration, the Democratic president and his aides pointed to economic indicators and data in vain, as the public's mood remained dark.\n\nAt 3%, inflation under Trump is still way below the 9.1% rate it peaked at under Biden, which was the worst cost-of-living crunch for decades.\n\nTrump effectively exploited this disconnect between the Democratic leadership in Washington and American voters' sentiment during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nNow, however, Trump finds himself facing similar circumstances, as Republicans seek to avoid a similar fate in the elections to come.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington, BBC Verify\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

Bank attacks surge\n\nDozens of Israeli settlers launched arson attacks targeting a Palestinian warehouse, a Bedouin village, and farmland in the north of the occupied West Bank on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral Palestinians were injured.\n\nThe incidents were the latest in a recent surge in settler violence coinciding with the olive harvest season, when Palestinians head to their agricultural land around towns and villages.\n\nIt comes just after the UN's humanitarian office said the number of violent attacks by settlers last month was the highest since it began collecting figures nearly 20 years ago.\n\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.\n\nThe settlements are illegal under international law.\n\nFootage from Tuesday shows dozens of masked men on a hillside east of Tulkarm. A Palestinian warehouse in Beit Lid was attacked, with lorries set on fire.\n\nTents can be seen ablaze in the Bedouin village of Deir Sharaf, with the sound of women shouting in the background.\n\nPalestinian Authority Minister Muayyad Shaaban, the head of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, said the attacks were part of a campaign to impose \"a hostile environment through intimidation and terror\".\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that troops went to the scene \"to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians\". It added that soldiers were then attacked by settlers gathering nearby and their vehicle was damaged.\n\nIsraeli police stated that four suspects were arrested.\n\nIn a post on X, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the latest events \"shocking and serious\", blaming \"a handful of violent and dangerous individuals\".\n\nHe went on: \"Such violence against civilians and against IDF soldiers crosses a red line and I condemn it severely.\"\n\nThe head of the IDF Central Command, Major-General Avi Bluth, also condemned the attacks, saying that such incidents \"undermine the stability of the security situation\".\n\n\"The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious. It must be dealt with firmly,\" he told officers, in comments sent by the Israeli military.\n\n\"The directive to IDF soldiers is clear: do not stand idly by and do everything in your power to prevent any act of nationalist crime.\"\n\nThe large-scale attack on Tuesday was a rare instance of Israeli law enforcement acting to counter settler violence, which has increased dramatically since the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 triggered the Gaza war.\n\nIsraeli rights group Yesh Din said that of 1,701 police investigations into offenses committed by Israelis against Palestinians in the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem) between 2005 and 2024, 93.8% of concluded cases closed with no indictment filed.\n\nThe UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that October saw more than 260 Israeli settler attacks resulting in casualties, property damage or both – an average of eight incidents per day.\n\nIt reports that settler violence during the olive harvest has reached the highest level recorded in recent years, with about 150 attacks documented so far, resulting in the injury of more than 140 Palestinians and the vandalism of more than 4,200 trees and saplings across 77 villages.\n\nSince the start of the year, some 1,500 settler attacks have been recorded.\n\nThe UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Tom Fletcher, recently wrote on X: \"The failure to prevent or punish such attacks is inconsistent with international law. Palestinians must be protected. Impunity cannot prevail. Perpetrators must be held accountable.\"\n\nPalestinians and human rights groups often accuse the IDF of protecting or aiding extremist settlers.\n\nOn Tuesday, hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of 13-year-old Aysam Mualla in Beita, near Nablus. He was reported to have been in a coma since inhaling tear gas fired by the IDF as villagers were picking their olives last month, near the settler outpost of Evyatar.\n\nIn some cases, Israeli activists and foreign volunteers have come to help Palestinian farmers during the olive harvest and have been attacked too.\n\nOn Saturday, videos from Beita posted to social media showed masked men using clubs to beat local Palestinians and volunteer paramedics, as well as a Reuters news agency photographer and security adviser.\n\nAn Israeli civilian, the 77-year-old head of a Tel Aviv art college, who had joined the harvest, was also photographed with blood streaming down his face.\n\nThe BBC has approached the IDF for comment about this incident.\n\nIn the nearby village of Burin, settlers attacked Palestinian olive harvesters and an off-duty IDF reservist helping them. Settlers also stole bags of olives.\n\nIn a statement, the IDF said: \"Several Israeli civilians threw stones at the harvesters. Several Israelis and Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment.\" It added that its soldiers \"operated to disperse the confrontation\".\n\nThe olive harvest is a major annual event for Palestinians and an important source of income for many.\n\nAccording to the Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now, the number of new homes in West Bank settlements for which tenders have been published in 2025 has already reached an all-time yearly high of 5,667 housing units. It says these are set to accommodate about 25,000 residents.\n\nThe pro-settler Israeli Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has prioritised speeding up the planning and approval process for new settler housing, as well as land appropriation for settlement construction and infrastructure, and retroactively legalising outposts set up without Israeli government authorisation.\n\nAs well as serving as finance minister, Smotrich has a ministerial position with responsibility for civilian affairs in the West Bank. He has declared that his efforts are designed to de facto annex the West Bank and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e352emrro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:02:25.104+00:00","title":"Happy birthday to the PlayStation 5 - but why no plans for a PS6?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The PlayStation 5 is showing no signs of being replaced by a PS6, as Sony’s leadership, including Eric Lempel, emphasizes the console’s strong performance, robust game pipeline, and enduring market relevance.

to count the number of years between game consoles on one hand.\n\nThe original Sony PlayStation came out in the UK in September 1995. Five years later, the PS2 was released and brought with it significant changes.\n\nIt was a similar story for other consoles but, of late, things seem to have slowed down - which might explain why, as the PS5 hits its fifth anniversary, a potential PS6 is nowhere in sight.\n\nAccording to PlayStation's business boss, Eric Lempel, that's because there's plenty of life in the old dog yet.\n\n\"I would say we're really hitting our stride now,\" he told BBC News.\n\nGiven there remains \"a lot of great content\"  the company is \"just going to continue with PS5\" he explained.\n\nMr Lempel oversaw the launch of the console, which was plagued by supply chain issues upon its release as a result of a global chip shortage.\n\nThe supply problems were resolved after three years, and the console has gone on to sell more than 84 million units worldwide.\n\nAnd, as it turns five, he said the title which would become the PS5's biggest seller hadn't even been released yet.\n\n\"I'm not going to tell you which one, but I think it's still to come,\" he said.\n\nThe fact PlayStation is able to predict blockbusters to come is in part because the PS5 has not been technologically superseded in the way consoles of the past might have been.\n\n\"Back in the 80s and 90s, each console brought huge jumps in power and capability relative to what came before,\" said Steve Cottam, boss of game streaming service Antstream Arcade.\n\n\"Today, improvements are still happening, but they're more technical and less immediately striking to the average player.\"\n\nThe fact the PS5 is set to be around for a while yet means Sony has plenty of high-profile games in the works.\n\nMarvel's Wolverine, made by the same team behind the successful Spider-Man series, is set for a 2026 release - while Intergalactic, the upcoming game from Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog, is in development.\n\nIndustry expert Christopher Dring said Naughty Dog's schedule went some way to explaining another reason why consoles were lasting longer - because it takes more time to make games for them than it used to.\n\n\"During the PS3 generation, Naughty Dog released four games,\" he said.\n\n\"During the PS4 generation, that dropped to three games - so far during the PS5 generation, it's not released one.\"\n\nHe said this story was repeated across the industry, with Grand Theft Auto 6 - which will be on both PlayStation and Xbox -  recently delayed to November 2026 .\n\nMr Lempel said another factor which might also explain the longevity of a console like the PS5 is that gamers are also more willing to try new things.\n\n\"We're seeing on average people are playing 50% more games than they did last generation, and they're really branching out to different types of games,\" he said.\n\n\"They'll play the hits, but they'll also play smaller games or unique games that they've never heard of before.\"\n\nOne gamer told the BBC the gap between console releases might not be a bad thing for consumers.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing they are no longer churning out new consoles every couple of years - with a new variation here, a slightly slimmer version there, a slightly bigger screen, and so on,\" said content creator Rachel Howie, known as DontRachQuit on Twitch.\n\n\"When the jumps in quality are bigger, they feel more worthwhile.\"\n\nAnother reason for Sony not to rush to unveil new hardware is that the PS5 remains ahead of its rivals, outselling Microsoft's Series X and S consoles - at least in the home console space.\n\nThe same can't be said when it comes to handhelds though.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch - a handheld console which connects to a TV to play games on a big screen - is the third-best selling console in history.\n\nIts sequel the Switch 2, which released in June 2025, has already sold 10 million units in its first few months.\n\nIt's not a fight PlayStation is giving up though.\n\n\"We're always about new innovation in the category,\" Mr Lempel said.\n\nThe success of Nintendo's hardware perhaps inspired Sony to release the PlayStation Portal, an accessory which lets you stream from a PS5 you already own.\n\nMr Lempel said Portal was \"performing really well\" and though he did not reveal exact sales figures, he said it had \"exceeded our expectations\".\n\nMr Dring said he believed there was another difference in the way games were being released now which might contribute to the length of time between hardware releases.\n\n\"Some of the biggest games today are still playable on PS4, and for the first three years it was relatively rare to see any PS5-only releases,\" he said.\n\n\"The games dominating the most played charts are titles like Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty: Warzone... games that are, in some cases, over 10 years old and are playable on much older devices.\n\n\"So it might be we are going to get a new console in 2027 - but the likelihood is that most of the games that will be launching alongside that device will be fully playable on existing hardware, too.\"\n\nRecent years have seen PlayStation make the move into TV and film, which Mr Lempel said was having an impact on game sales too.\n\n\"We've also found that some people discover these characters and worlds and want more,\" he said.\n\n\"If you look at something like The Last of Us, they want to know what happens.\"\n\nHe said the upcoming season three of the show was \"going to be phenomenal\", with future shows based on God of War and Ghost of Tsushima in the pipeline.\n\nBut if he could pick any PlayStation game to turn into a TV programme, there was one clear winner - 2002 racoon crime caper Sly Cooper.\n\n\"That's a game I love from Sucker Punch, another one of our great developers that has evolved several times over the years and done a lot of great stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just think that would be a really interesting show... like an Ocean's 11 type thing. I think it would be great.\"\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.  Outside the UK?

But the margin for error is razor thin.\n\nHere are four potential hold-ups for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president's desk for signing into law.\n\nA key sticking point throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a renewal of tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 million Americans.\n\nSenate Republicans instead only agreed to grant Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the subsidies –  something they had already offered weeks ago.\n\nAnd House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits.\n\nThis entails a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they torpedo the subsidies, health coverage premiums could rocket, handing Democrats a ready-made campaign issue for next year's midterm elections.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to say she is \"disgusted\" premiums could double for her own grown-up children. The president said on Monday his ally had \"lost her way\".\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the subsidies expiring by the end of December, Republicans have not yet finalised their plan.\n\nThey want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are proposing the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals - although the details are unclear.\n\nOut of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their sails after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.\n\nBut those victories, like the shutdown fight, have accentuated strategic tensions between the pragmatic and progressive, or left-wing, factions of the party.\n\nThe Democratic left is furious at defectors who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a capitulation to Trump.\n\nFrom that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a \"horrific mistake\". California Governor Gavin Newsom called it \"surrender\".\n\nHouse Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York told CNN on Tuesday: \"We're strongly opposed as House Democrats to this reckless Republican effort to continue to raise the high cost of living on everyday Americans.\"\n\nHowever, centrist Democrats like Jared Golden of Maine, who recently announced he won't run for re-election, may cross the aisle.\n\nAnother moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, has indicated he may help get the Republicans' spending plan over the line.\n\nOnce a Democratic congresswoman-elect from Arizona is sworn in on Wednesday the Republican majority in the House will be whittled down to five votes – 219-214.\n\nRepublicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the spending plan.\n\nWhile most House Republicans are expected to support the funding package, given that Trump backs it, fiscal hawks may object.\n\nThe proposed deal would leave the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn of debt.\n\nPotential Republican defectors Thomas Massie of Kentucky or Victoria Spartz of Indiana have remained tight-lipped so far on how they plan to vote.\n\nBut congressman Chip Roy of Texas said he was \"unaware of any opposition of significance\" to the bill from members of his conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber out of session for the last seven weeks to focus pressure on Senate Democrats to make a shutdown deal.\n\nHe has urged lawmakers to return to Washington immediately for the crunch vote.\n\nBut members of Congress face the same flight delays that have plagued other Americans during the spending impasse.\n\nWith nearly 1,200 flights cancelled on Tuesday as unpaid air traffic controllers call in sick because of the funding deadlock, lawmakers are finding other ways to reach Washington.\n\nRepublican congressmen Rick Crawford of Arkansas and Trent Kelly of Mississippi are carpooling to the nation's capital.\n\nCongressman Derrick Van Orden said he was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle from his home state of Wisconsin.\n\nRecord-cold temperatures and heavy snow have also hit the Great Lakes region in the Midwest, adding to the delays.\n\nYou can also get in touch by following this link"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/trump-food-stamps-safety-net.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"14:38:05-05:00","title":"By Not Funding Food Stamps, Trump Risks Lasting Damage to Safety Net","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that during a 43-day federal government shutdown in late 2025, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faced a major interruption, with President Donald Trump refusing to fund food stamp benefits despite available funds.

will soon flow again to the roughly 42 million low-income Americans who rely on Washington to purchase groceries.\n\nBut the damage wrought by days of delays, in a crisis that President Trump had refused to resolve, is likely to prove longer lasting.\n\nFor the poorest Americans, the expected end to the longest shutdown in U.S. history has done little to quell their doubt and anxiety, leaving their faith shaken in the food stamp program and in the reliability of the federal government to serve as a social safety net.\n\nNever before had there been such an interruption to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a decades-old initiative that serves about one in eight Americans. But the lapse it has experienced during the 43-day federal stoppage seemed to erode the fundamental guarantee that the government would protect the most vulnerable families from harm.\n\nA total breakdown in the nation’s largest anti-hunger program might have been unfathomable in past shutdowns, and under prior administrations. But Mr. Trump promised throughout the fiscal stalemate to slash programs favored by Democrats. He spoke openly about using the core functions of government as a form of political leverage, while his administration refused to tap ample leftover funds to provide full food stamps this month.\n\nMr. Trump’s aides opposed any requirement that they disburse complete aid, threatening states and mounting a legal fight that it twice took to the Supreme Court. Even on Monday, as the Senate worked to reopen the government, the administration continued to resist. In at least one state, Mr. Trump’s actions threatened to shut off the cards used by families to buy groceries, according to local officials, who pressed ahead with a lawsuit to force the release of benefits.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

14,700 Homes to Queens\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T16:58:08-05:00\n\nThe New York City Council unanimously approved a rezoning on Wednesday that could transform an industrial stretch of Queens into thousands of apartments — private development aimed at addressing the city’s affordable housing crisis.\n\nThe vote comes a little over a week after the mayoral election, in which housing was a top issue for voters and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani cruised to victory on a platform of affordability.\n\nUnder the plan, developers could build nearly 15,000 apartments within 54 blocks of Long Island City that are currently filled with warehouses and parking lots. Seven years ago, left-leaning politicians opposed a plan that would have given incentives to Amazon to build a headquarters in the same neighborhood.\n\nThe new plan, with its focus on housing and community amenities instead of huge public subsidies for a wealthy company like Amazon, has earned the support of the local councilwoman, Julie Won, and other politicians who did not want the headquarters.\n\nThe proposal includes nearly hundreds of millions of dollars for parks, public housing, schools, sewers and more. About 30 percent of the housing must be affordable to people of lower or moderate incomes.\n\n“We are fully aware that New York City is in an affordable housing crisis and a housing crisis at large,” Ms. Won said on Wednesday. “Long Island City — we will continue to be a leader in the production of new housing.”\n\nMr. Mamdani, whose assembly district includes parts of the rezoning area, said in a statement on Wednesday that the plan was a “victory for Long Island City residents.”\n\nCity officials have increasingly come to see neighborhood-specific development proposals as valuable ways to confront a housing shortage that is at its worst point in nearly 60 years. The city has approved plans in Midtown Manhattan, the east Bronx, Jamaica in Queens, SoHo in Manhattan and Gowanus in Brooklyn in recent years.\n\nFew parts of New York reflect its housing conundrum as vividly as Long Island City.\n\nThe neighborhood’s proximity to Manhattan office buildings and access to several subway lines have made it a hotbed of luxury development and a symbol of gentrification. Some 28,000 homes have been built in the surrounding area over the past decade and a half, according to the Department of City Planning. The typical asking rent is more than $4,500 a month.\n\nStill, many of the blocks in the rezoning area have remained cut off from residential development because they are zoned for manufacturing uses, a relic of the neighborhood’s industrial past.\n\nThose blocks have long been an alluring site for development; there have been at least five failed attempts to build on portions of the area since 2015, including the Amazon deal.\n\nThe new proposal’s approval on Wednesday represents a shift in the political calculus.\n\n“The approval of this plan opens the door for more New Yorkers of all income levels to live and work here — and to benefit from new open space and community investments,” said Dan Garodnick, the chair of the City Planning Commission and the director of the Planning Department, which helped shape the plan.\n\nDespite the supportive comments of Ms. Won, Mr. Mamdani and other left-leaning politicians, the plan still generated opposition from community members.\n\nOrganizers with the Western Queens Community Land Trust, which advocates neighborhood ownership of property, had urged Ms. Won to vote against the proposal, citing worries about gentrification and affordability.\n\nJenny Dubnau, co-chair of the trust’s board, said “crucial community needs” seemed to be an “afterthought,” negotiated only at the end.\n\n“We wish the plan had been focused from the get-go on true infrastructure and affordability needs, driven by data and community input — rather than originating as a rezoning,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/massachusetts-housing-bill-seasonal-communities.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:46:44-05:00","title":"Massachusetts Offered a Solution to Housing Shortages.

It had been converted into a kind of modern-day boardinghouse by Community Development Corporation of South Berkshire, a nonprofit group that develops affordable housing, and opened this year. Rent for a room, which comes with a private bathroom but tenants have to share the kitchen, starts at $900 a month, in a town where the average rent is $2,500, according to Zillow. Nearby, the Windflower, another inn once popular with tourists, was also repurposed as housing for workers and opened in 2023.\n\nBoth properties are much needed in Berkshire County, where high housing costs and a tight market in towns like Great Barrington and Stockbridge have made it challenging for workers in sectors such as education and health care to find a place to live.

their debut last year.\n\nThe six-piece, who were recently nominated for best new artist at the Grammy Awards, told BBC News that the messages, which have also targeted their families, \"can get really heavy\".\n\n\"I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, but if 1,000 people are sending you death threats, it's jarring,\" said singer Lara Raj. \"Even if it's not going to happen, it's heavy.\"\n\nRaj, who is a US citizen with Tamil Indian heritage, has also been subjected to racist comments, and was falsely reported to ICE for \"working and residing in the United States without legal authorisation\".\n\nThe 20-year-old said she had \"deleted Twitter\" (now known as X), to avoid seeing negative comments.\n\n\"I realised I am not the audience for other people's opinions,\" she said.\n\nKatseye did not specify the nature of the threats they have received; but aggressive and inappropriate behaviour is  depressingly common amongst fan communities .\n\nLast year,  Chappell Roan criticised  the \"many nonconsensual physical and social interactions\" she had had with fans, including people harassing her family and friends.\n\nPop band Muna chastised some of their supporters for \"spreading falsehoods about us and our loved ones for clout and attention\"; while Doja Cat called out \"creepy\" behaviour from a section of her fanbase.\n\n\"Our career has been really short, but I feel like we've gotten a lot of things already said to us, to our families,\" said Katseye singer Sophia Laforteza.\n\n\"We know that we signed up for being so public. We know it's a part of fame. But it doesn't change the fact that we are human.\"\n\nRaj also pointed out the sexist nature of the comments the band have received.\n\n\"People see us as women to rank. They'll grade us based on how pretty we are, our singing skill, dancing skill, and then add it up and give us a percentage.\n\n\"That's so dystopian.\"\n\n\"I feel like it's very terrorising on the mind,\" added her bandmate Manon Bannerman.\n\nDespite the online negativity, Katseye are having a remarkable year.\n\nTheir second EP, Beautiful Chaos, peaked at number two in the US album charts, thanks to the gratingly brilliant lead single, Gnarly, and the Charli XCX-penned follow-up, Gabriella.\n\nAn advert they filmed for the clothing brand Gap went viral in August, racking up 400 million plays and 8 billion social media \"impressions\" (\"Isn't there only 7 billion people in the world?\" asked singer Megan Skiendiel when presented with the statistic).\n\nLast month, they won best performance at the MTV Awards. Five days ago, they became only the third girl group in history to receive a best new artist nomination at the Grammys, following SWV and Wilson Phillips.\n\nThe six members, who range in age between 17 and 22, are truly international.\n\nDaniela Avanzini is a Venezuelan-Cuban American from Atlanta. Raj is an Indian-Sri Lankan American from New York. Bannerman is a Ghanaian-Italian from Zurich. Megan Skiendiel is a Chinese-Singaporean American from Honolulu. Laforteza is from Manila in the Philippines. And Yoonchae Jeung was born and raised in South Korea.\n\nThey were hand-picked to form Katseye on The Debut: Dream Academy, a reality show created by Korean entertainment giant Hybe – the label behind BTS and Le Sserafim - and America's Geffen Records, home to Olivia Rodrigo and Guns N' Roses.\n\nThousands applied, but only 20 made it through to the training and development stage – a gruelling, two-year bootcamp of daily dance lessons, vocal practice and brutal feedback.\n\nRehearsing one dance routine, they were scolded for their lack of synchronisation: \"It's got to sound like one person walking down the stairs. It can't sound like a group of people falling down the stairs.\"\n\nThose days are long behind them. The sextet learned the intricate, aerobic choreography for their Gap advert in just one day.\n\n\"The longer we're together as a group, the shorter it takes,\" said Skiendiel.\n\n\"One day of rehearsals and we're really in sync. Then we nitpick the rest.\"\n\nLast year's SIS (Soft Is Strong) EP established the band with a confident, slick pop sound. But it was Gnarly that really put them on the map.\n\nReleased in April, the song is two minutes and seventeen seconds of aggressively chaotic beat drops, juddering synths and gang vocals.\n\nIt instantly divided opinion: \"Genuinely atrocious\" was one of the kinder comments. “But people kept coming back for more. At the time of writing, it's been streamed more than half a billion times. No less than The New York Times called it  “the future of K-pop”.\n\n\"When we first heard it, we knew it was going to be shocking,\" said Avanzini.\n\n\"That was so exciting, the idea of making people upset,\" agreed Raj. \"Not giving them something that's just okay - we were really giving something thrilling.\"\n\nIt may have been polarising - but Gnarly turned Katseye from a pop curiosity to a burgeoning cultural phenomenon.\n\nOne early fan was Melanie C, who hosted a showcase for the band in London last month.\n\nSpeaking on stage, she said Katseye reminded her of the Spice Girls.\n\n\"Something about the Spice Girls was so many people felt they could identify with one of us,\" she said. \"And I think that's so beautiful about [the diversity of] your band: You open that door even further for so many people.\"\n\n\"We pride ourselves so much that our group is so diverse,\" Bannerman told the BBC.\n\n\"It's our number one priority to show the girlies out there to be proud of where they come from, no matter what they look like.\"\n\nAnd, despite the online pushback she's received, Raj encourages musicians from diverse backgrounds to pursue their dreams.\n\n\"Please do it,\" she told the BBC. \"You cannot feel held back.\n\n\"Our skin colour, our culture is our power. Use it and own it.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/epstein-emails-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:46:16-05:00","title":"What Newly Released Emails Tell Us About Epstein and Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the release of previously sealed emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, which reveal private communications between Epstein and key political and media figures, including Donald Trump, Michael Wolff, and Alexander Acosta.

The tabloids had recently spotted him out and about, trying to return to his old social circles. Mr. Epstein was sensitive to what was being said about him, emailing with his employees about negative news coverage. Mr. Trump, now a star on his reality television show, “The Apprentice,” was talking publicly about running for president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee said on X that the victim the email exchanged referred to was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was 16 when she was recruited by Mr. Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell while she was working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.\n\nWhen Mr. Epstein sent the email in April 2011, Ms. Giuffre had recently gone public for the first time about her experiences with Mr. Epstein, telling a British tabloid that he had abused her and trafficked her to other men and providing the outlet with a now-famous photo of herself, Prince Andrew and Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Giuffre was asked in a civil case if Mr. Trump had witnessed the sexual abuse of minors in Mr. Epstein’s home, and she said, “I don’t think Donald Trump participated in anything.” A representative for Ms. Giuffre’s family declined to comment.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto jeffrey E.

Mr. Epstein was dealing with fallout from his conduct but was far from the infamous figure he is now.\n\nStill, Mr. Epstein continued to socialize with notable people. Among them was the journalist Michael Wolff, who encouraged Mr. Epstein to speak out about Mr. Trump and went on to write a biography of the president early in his first administration.\n\nDuring a presidential debate on Dec. 15, 2015, Mr. Trump did not field any questions about Mr. Epstein, according to a transcript, despite an assertion about a media appearance that day by Mr. Wolff beforehand.

A series of Miami Herald articles showed that he received lenient treatment from prosecutors years earlier, including from Alexander Acosta, who was Mr. Trump’s labor secretary at the time.\n\nMr. Epstein’s schedules showed he had continued to meet with Mr. Wolff, who has said he sat in on some unreleased recorded interviews that Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, had conducted with Mr. Epstein.\n\nSoon after this email exchange, the Justice Department said it was investigating how Mr. Epstein’s plea deal had been handled.\n\nImportance: High\n\nMichael Wolff\n\nto Jeffrey Epstein [email protected]\n\n10/29/2016 12:21:03 PM\n\nThere's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him.

It was unclear specifically what Mr. Wolff believed Mr. Epstein would say or whether Mr. Epstein responded to the message.\n\nOne theme that has emerged from the emails is how Mr. Wolff appeared to act as an adviser to Mr. Epstein and suggested he speak publicly against Mr. Trump.\n\nIn another email exchange earlier in 2016, Mr. Wolff advised Mr. Epstein to take an “anti-Trump position” as a way to get ahead of the upcoming release of the book “Filthy Rich” about Mr. Epstein’s life and crimes.\n\nImportance: High\n\nto jeffrey E.

Mr. Black replied that Mr. Acosta would be by himself, with “perhaps a trump administration to assist and accompany him.”\n\nThe Epstein deal was brought up during Mr. Acosta’s confirmation hearing. Mr. Acosta defended it, saying it was offered based on the evidence he had at the time. Mr. Acosta was confirmed, but he would resign in 2019, after Mr. Epstein was charged in New York.

Mr. Kahn called the financial disclosure form “100 pages of nonsense.”\n\nIt wasn’t clear why Mr. Kahn was looking into Mr. Trump’s finances or whether Mr. Epstein responded.

The bishops said they “oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and “pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.”\n\n“We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity,” the statement said. “For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.”\n\nThe bishops, who were often divided by American politics in the Pope Francis era, showed a united front in standing behind Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the United States, who has spoken out for immigrants and urged U.S. bishops to do the same.\n\nThe statement, called a special message, is a rare pastoral document that the bishops can issue only at their annual meeting, in order to address pressing circumstances of the day.\n\nThe last time they issued one was in 2013, in opposition to the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama.\n\nFor months, Catholic bishops have pushed back against the federal actions. Prelates have accompanied migrants to courthouses and protested Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill in Congress. But this action sends a particularly strong message not only to the administration, which includes many high-profile Catholics, but also to the millions of the church’s immigrant families.\n\nThe statement outlined a litany of concerns, which many bishops see as more pastoral than political.\n\n“We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement,” it said. “We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.\n\n“We lament that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status. We are troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship and the special nature of hospitals and schools. We are grieved when we meet parents who fear being detained when taking their children to school and when we try to console family members who have already been separated from their loved ones.”\n\nThe statement overwhelmingly passed, with 216 anonymous votes in favor. Five bishops voted no, and three abstained.\n\nBefore the vote, Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, the newly elected president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the room, “I am strongly in support of it.”\n\nPope Leo expressed a specific desire for the bishops to give a united statement on the issue last month, when Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso hand-delivered some 100 letters to him from immigrants.\n\nAfter a full day of public meetings in Baltimore on Tuesday, bishops huddled privately and discussed what to include in the statement for five hours. Some worried that a statement could create backlash from the White House, on issues like religious worker visas, that the bishops are trying to address.\n\nBut unlike some previous annual gatherings, this year, on this issue, the bishops presented a largely united public front.\n\nCardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, where federal agents have conducted immigration raids for weeks, praised the statement’s near-unanimous support.\n\nOn the floor, he had suggested an amendment to make explicit that the bishops opposed the indiscriminate, mass deportation of people. It was quickly approved.\n\n“This is a time of really reflecting on what’s happening, and to not be afraid to respond to the need to defend the dignity of people,” he said in an interview.\n\nSome prelates, like Bishop Oscar Cantú of San Jose, Calif., wished the statement was even stronger.\n\nBut the amendment from Cardinal Cupich “really gave the document gravitas,” said Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami, who had strongly criticized the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. This summer, he drove there on a Harley-Davidson with the Knights on Bikes, a motorcycle ministry, to pray the rosary at its entrance.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, as the bishops discussed the final amendments to the statement, Bishop José María Garcia-Maldonado came to a microphone on the floor.\n\nAs a new bishop, this was his first bishops conference, he told the room. He asked that the statement speak not only to migrant families but also to immigrant priests like him.\n\n“As a migrant person coming from Mexico to the United States, for me and my whole family, thank you for this,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/immigrants-wrongful-detention-chicago-release.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:24:46-05:00","title":"Federal Judge Plans to Release Some Immigrants Arrested in Chicago Area","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Chicago, Jeffrey Cummings, has ordered the release of 615 immigrants arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale enforcement campaign under the Trump administration.

Those released would have to post a bond and would be electronically monitored while their cases proceeded in immigration court.\n\nIt was not clear how many of those people, many of whom are believed to have been arrested during the administration’s recent crackdown on illegal immigration in the Chicago area, are still in the United States. The judge agreed to give government lawyers time to note anyone they believe poses a public safety threat but barred the government for now from deporting anyone in that group.\n\n“They still will have to go to court,” said Judge Cummings, who issued rulings from the bench but had not released a written order by Wednesday evening. “They still will be subject to removal upon an immigration court order.”\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, criticized the judge’s decision and said it put lives at risk.\n\n“At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” Ms. McLaughlin said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe ruling came as part of a long-running case that was filed in 2018, during President Trump’s first term, and resolved with a consent decree during the presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr. That consent decree imposed restrictions on when immigration enforcement agents in six states, including Illinois, could apprehend and hold people without a warrant.\n\nFederal agents have flooded the Chicago area since early September, making thousands of arrests and sometimes clashing with residents as part of the Trump administration’s campaign against illegal immigration and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who represent a group of people who say they were wrongly arrested by immigration agents, said they believed many of the recent arrests had been made without warrants and in violation of the terms of their agreement with the government.\n\nIn court, William Weiland, a lawyer for the federal government, asked for more time to sort through details of detainees’ backgrounds and to confer with his clients. He called the judge’s ruling “quite significant” and said that the government “has not conceded at any point that there has been repeated material violations” of the consent decree.\n\nMr. Weiland said the government considered at least 12 of the 615 detainees to be significant threats to public safety. Judge Cummings said he did not want to release those people.\n\nJudge Cummings, who was nominated to his role by Mr. Biden, said that he did “not sit in the position of making policy for the government” but that he intended to make sure the consent decree was being followed.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs said they believed that many more people arrested in the Chicago-area crackdown — beyond the 615 detainees — had also been wrongly detained, in violation of the consent decree. The judge ordered the government to turn over information about more recent arrests in the coming days.\n\nMark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center, who represents plaintiffs, said he believed the case would show that “this whole operation the last two months — the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, the brutalizing of people here — has all been unlawful.”\n\nJudge Cummings is among several federal judges who have raised concerns about the conduct of immigration agents in the Chicago area this fall.\n\nLast week, one federal judge said that their “use of force shocks the conscience” and issued a preliminary injunction placing limits on agents’ actions. Another federal judge voiced concerns about what he considered “unnecessarily cruel” conditions inside an immigration detention center in the Chicago suburbs and ordered the government to make improvements.\n\nHomeland Security officials have repeatedly defended agents’ tactics and the conditions at that detention site. They have pointed out acts of aggression toward agents, including an incident over the weekend in which they said shots were fired at Border Patrol agents in Chicago.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/michael-wolff-epstein-trump-emails.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:57:31-05:00","title":"Michael Wolff, Chronicler of Elites, Advised Epstein About Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that Michael Wolff, a prominent journalist known for his books and reporting on Donald Trump, advised Jeffrey Epstein on how to respond to media scrutiny involving Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Trump, who was running for president at the time.\n\nThat revelation emerged from emails between Mr. Wolff and Mr. Epstein released by Washington lawmakers.\n\nIn one of the emails, from December 2015, Mr. Wolff says that CNN planned to ask Mr. Trump about his relationship with Mr. Epstein, and then counsels Mr. Epstein on next steps. “I think you should let him hang himself,” Mr. Wolff wrote of Mr. Trump.\n\nIn another email, from October 2016, Mr. Wolff sent Mr. Epstein an email saying that there was an “opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him.” The exchange came late in Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign, and weeks after a recording emerged of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women to an “Access Hollywood” host.\n\nThe emails shed new light on the author-source relationship between Mr. Wolff, 72, and Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019. Mr. Wolff did not immediately respond to a requests for comment for this article.\n\nBefore the November 2024 presidential election, Mr. Wolff disclosed that he had interviewed Mr. Epstein “periodically” for his 2018 book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” which rocketed to the top of best-seller lists with its depiction of a chaotic White House and key officials criticizing the president.\n\nIn 2019, Mr. Epstein was charged in a federal indictment with sex trafficking of minors; he was subsequently found dead in a cell at a Manhattan federal detention facility. Authorities concluded that he had died by suicide. The case against Mr. Epstein, and the circumstances of his death, fueled years of speculation about his relations with top figures in American politics and business.\n\nGiven the public interest in Mr. Epstein, Mr. Wolff released tapes of his interviews with the convicted sex offender shortly before the 2024 presidential election — though only after approaching numerous media outlets. “I would say I had a dozen meetings, maybe a dozen and a half meetings, with various outlets, and everybody was interested — everybody was listening, there were a lot of executives in rooms or on Zoom calls — and then everybody passed,” Mr. Wolff said in an interview with James Surowiecki in The Yale Review.\n\nThe Daily Beast published an exclusive on the tapes.\n\nMr. Wolff has written several books on Mr. Trump and published his shorter fare in Vanity Fair, the Hollywood Reporter, New York magazine and other outlets. The often eyebrow-raising details in his reporting have long drawn criticism for his reporting tactics. In a 2004 piece in the New Republic, Michelle Cottle wrote, “the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created — springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events.”\n\nIn a 2019 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Wolff said, “As a journalist — or as a writer — my obligation is to come as close to the truth as I possibly can. And that’s not as close to someone else’s truth, but the truth as I see it.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/snap-food-aid-government-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:04:28-05:00","title":"42 Million People Are Enrolled in SNAP.

Who Are They?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T10:04:28-05:00\n\nThe longest government shutdown in U.S. history brought with it a brawl between President Trump and Democrats in Congress and in the states over food assistance and whether the Trump administration had the authority to cut it off.\n\nSo what is the food aid program known as SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program?\n\nSNAP, the nation’s biggest anti-hunger program, is funded federally but administered largely by state agencies. In a handful of states, county governments dispense benefits and monitor eligibility.\n\nThe program is now used by 42 million low-income people — one in eight Americans — to purchase groceries. People receive benefits electronically each month through an electronic benefits transfer, or E.B.T., card that functions much like a debit card.\n\nThe SNAP program is the modern successor to the food stamp program, which dates to 1939 and the New Deal. The name was changed in 2008 “to fight stigma,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nEligibility is based on income limits — typically 130 percent of the federal poverty level — and participants are subject to reporting rules and work requirements. In 2025, that 130 percent figure translates into $529 a week for a household of two, or $27,495 a year, according to federal guidelines. The eligibility cutoff is $41,795 for a family of four.\n\nOverall, federal spending on SNAP totaled almost $100 billion in 2024. SNAP recipients receive $187 a month on average.\n\nNearly 90 percent of SNAP recipients are native-born American citizens, according to the latest data from the Agriculture Department, and 96 percent were citizens.\n\nAbout 62 percent of SNAP participants are in families with children. About 40 percent of SNAP recipients are children under 18, and about 20 percent are over the age of 60.\n\nThe states with the highest percentages of SNAP recipients are New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Oregon.\n\nIn the past, enrollment in SNAP, and its costs, have usually aligned with unemployment and poverty rates. The Agriculture Department’s Economic Research Service has described SNAP as a “countercyclical” program that acts as an “automatic stabilizer to the economy,” meaning that the program is designed to expand during economic downturns and shrink when the economy heats up.\n\nGoing back decades, participation in SNAP usually varied between 7 percent and 11 percent of the population, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. That percentage rose significantly during the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, peaking at almost 19 percent in 2013, or more than 47 million people.\n\nDuring the pandemic, under the first Trump administration, emergency legislation temporarily and partly suspended a longstanding requirement that “able-bodied” adult SNAP recipients without dependents work. The suspension ended in 2023, and the Biden administration agreed to add stricter work requirements to SNAP under a deal with Republican lawmakers in 2023.\n\nYet even as the economy has recovered, if slowly, from the pandemic, the gap between wealthy and poor Americans has become more pronounced, and SNAP enrollment has not deviated much from its level of 41 million. Analysts have attributed the numbers in part to a weak job market, inflation, uncertainty over the economy and an uneven recovery that has enriched the top end of the economic spectrum while leaving the bottom end behind.\n\nThe 41 million figure is likely to shrink soon, but not necessarily because the economy will lift SNAP beneficiaries out of poverty. Instead, Mr. Trump’s signature domestic policy law, which took effect on Nov. 1, will change a number of criteria affecting SNAP, according to federal guidance.\n\nStarting this month, able-bodied adults between ages 18 and 64 must work at least 80 hours per month, or be involved in volunteering or an education or training program, to remain eligible for more than three months in a three-year period. The previous age limit was 54.\n\nCaregivers of children have long had an exemption from worth requirements, and children were defined as anyone under 18 in a SNAP recipient’s care. Under the new law, the exemption applies to people caring for children under 14. Homeless people, veterans and people under 24 who had aged out of foster care also used to be exempt. Now they are not.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the changes will force states to reduce or eliminate SNAP benefits, whether because people do not meet the new requirements or fail to provide the proper paperwork. As many as 2.4 million people are expected to fall out of the program because of the work requirements alone.\n\nThe Trump administration raised pressure on Democrats to vote to reopen the government without the health care concessions they were demanding, in large part by cutting off SNAP benefits. After lower courts ruled that the administration would have to pay those benefits, the U.S.D.A. rushed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court rather than comply.

Makes It Harder for Mamdani to Build Over Elizabeth Street Garden\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T17:41:24-05:00\n\nA little less than five months ago, Mayor Eric Adams gave up on the city’s long-running bid to replace the Elizabeth Street Garden in Lower Manhattan with affordable housing. But now that his successor, Zohran Mamdani, has vowed to take up the fight again, the Adams administration is apparently trying to make sure it won’t be easy.\n\nIn a Nov. 3 letter to the parks commissioner, Iris Rodriguez-Rosa, the commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, Louis Molina, said that the city “unequivocally and permanently dedicates this property to public use as parkland.”\n\nThe parkland designation means Mr. Mamdani now will most likely need the approval of the State Legislature to build housing on the site. The news publication Gothamist first reported on the letter on Wednesday.\n\nRandy Mastro, the first deputy mayor, said in a statement, “We are committed to ensuring Elizabeth Street Garden remains a beloved community park and cannot be alienated in the future.”\n\nThe fight over the garden, a one-acre plot in the NoLIta neighborhood, has been an emblem both of how difficult it can be to build housing in wealthy areas and the passionate commitment of many New Yorkers to preserve green space. The project would have included affordable housing for older people and some 16,000 square feet of green space, about a third of the space in the garden.\n\nMr. Adams had initially supported the housing development, and the lot’s nonprofit tenant had been scheduled to be evicted in March. The nonprofit, community members and celebrities like Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Patti Smith had fought to save the garden over the past several years.\n\nBut then the mayor reversed himself in June and abandoned the plan, saying he would instead seek to build more housing elsewhere.\n\nMr. Mamdani said during his mayoral campaign that he would restart plans to build housing on the lot, angering supporters of the garden. His campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move by Mr. Adams on Wednesday angered development advocates.\n\n“With this disgraceful final act, the Adams administration is once again prioritizing elite comfort over affordable homes for vulnerable elderly people,” Andrew Fine, the chief of staff at the pro-housing group Open New York said in a statement on Wednesday. “Eric Adams’s time in City Hall may be over, but this fight is not.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/penny-coin-legacy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:22:12-05:00","title":"The Penny Dies at 232","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The American penny, first minted in 1793 and long a symbol of frugality, luck, and cultural identity, was officially retired in 2025 after 232 years of circulation.

232\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T15:22:12-05:00\n\nThe American penny died on Wednesday in Philadelphia. It was 232.\n\nThe cause was irrelevance and expensiveness, the Treasury Department said.\n\nNothing could be bought any more with a penny, not even penny candy. Moreover, the cost to mint the penny had risen to more than 3 cents, a financial absurdity that doomed the coin.\n\nThe final pennies were minted on Wednesday afternoon in Philadelphia. Top Treasury officials were on hand for its final journey. No last words were recorded.\n\nIn its heyday, the penny had immense cultural impact. It was the going rate for thoughts. It was a symbol of frugality, saved and/or earned. It could sometimes be pretty and other times arrive from heaven. And how many ideas would never have come to light without a penny dropping?\n\nWhen picked up, it was said to bring good luck for a 24-hour period, an assertion commonly made, but one that was never proven by any scientific double-blind studies.\n\nOn the darker side, a penny could undoubtedly be bad, especially when turning up.\n\nIt found its way into films (“Penny Serenade”) and songs (“Penny Lover”).\n\nA foray into footwear, specifically loafers, was a huge success for many decades, and the shoe remains readily available today.\n\nIn comparison, about the best the nickel could do was be wooden.\n\nThe American penny was preceded in death by its smaller sibling, the half cent (1793-1857), and its cousin the Canadian penny (1858-2012). The British penny coin, born in the seventh century, somewhat incredibly, survives it.\n\nThe American penny was born in 1793 in Philadelphia. Its parent was Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury, who was the chief author of the Coinage Act, which birthed the penny and its siblings.\n\nThe penny went through several reinventions. At birth, it depicted Lady Liberty. In 1909, Abraham Lincoln took over the front for the rest of its life.\n\nThe reverse of the coin was where it showed more variety, with a 15-link chain, a wreath, wheat stalks and the Lincoln Memorial all getting moments. In 2009, the variations increased, with a log cabin and other designs. Most recently it depicted a Union shield.\n\nThe penny was at first strictly a copper coin. In 1943, because of hunger for copper for the war effort, it changed for a year into zinc-coated steel. Starting in 1982, and until its death, the penny, so associated with its copper color, was in fact 97.5 percent zinc and merely 2.5 percent copper plating.\n\nAs the penny entered its long decline, it more and more frequently found itself casually tossed into a jar in someone’s home or ignominiously dropped in a “Take a Penny” tray at retailers. Calls grew for it to be euthanized, citing its obsolescence. In the end, President Trump signed its death warrant in February.\n\nEven after death, the penny will not vanish for a while longer. There are some 250 billion pennies in circulation and they will be out there, gathering dust, or maybe, very, very rarely, being used to help pay for something. As the last pennies slowly disappear, businesses will have no choice but to round transactions to the nearest nickel when dealing with cash.\n\nWith the penny’s demise, coin enthusiasts’ worried eyes now turn toward its longtime associate, the nickel. Its purchasing power has also shrunk to nearly nothing, and it costs more than a dime to make.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/uk-nuclear-power-plant.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:00:06-05:00","title":"Britain Gives Go-Ahead to Smaller Nuclear Reactor in Wales","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Britain has officially approved the construction of a small modular reactor (SMR) plant at Wylfa on Anglesey Island in northern Wales, marking a significant step in the UK’s nuclear energy ambitions.

Government\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T18:23:41-05:00\n\nA new coalition led by Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed al-Sudani, appeared to have won the greatest share of votes in the country’s parliamentary election, according to preliminary election counts on Wednesday, but not enough to form a government.\n\nWith no clear victor emerging from the Tuesday election, it will take months of political horse trading for some of the winning parliamentary lists to assemble a bloc large enough to form a government.\n\nPolitical experts say that Mr. al-Sudani, who has tried to promote himself to Washington as someone who can help keep Iranian influence in check, will struggle against rivals determined to deprive him of a second term.\n\nOfficial election results will be announced in the coming days, Iraq’s electoral commission told reporters. But on Tuesday evening, it released provincial preliminary results, which showed Mr. al-Sudani’s parliamentary list, Reconstruction and Development, taking the most seats.\n\n“We will immediately enter negotiations to form a competent government,” Mr. al-Sudani said on Tuesday evening, after election forecasts showed his bloc leading in eight out of 18 provinces, including the capital, Baghdad.\n\nThis was the sixth parliamentary election of Iraq’s 20-year-old democracy, and it offered the largest number of candidates yet — a dizzying 7,743 people competing for 329 seats. Critics say it was most likely the most expensive election in the country ever, and deeply marred by vote buying.\n\nParliamentary seats become bargaining chips in the formation of the government, whose ministries will eventually be key to handing out lucrative state contracts.\n\nIraqi parliamentary negotiations are famously complex and often extremely long. The last government took nearly a year to form, and the front-runner is almost always knocked down.\n\nThe process of forming the government is also deeply influenced by competition between Washington and Tehran, which was often able to outmaneuver its superpower rival in Iraq.\n\nSince the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq toppled the dictator Saddam Hussein, the country’s politics have been dominated by its Shiite Muslim majority, and many of their parties are close to Iran, the regional Shiite power.\n\nIn recent years, Iraqi militias aligned with Tehran have turned to politics, ensuring both political clout and financial gain. Their political allies hold several ministries in the current government.\n\nBut Washington now has the upper hand, Iraqi political leaders say, after Iran and its allies were dealt a string of humiliating blows by Israeli strikes that upended the regional power balance.\n\nIraqi officials say their U.S. counterparts have made it clear that the Trump administration will not accept leaders in the next government who are close to Iran.\n\nU.S. officials have also loudly signaled that they want the next Iraqi government to disarm Iranian-aligned militias — a potentially explosive endeavor.\n\nSome of those parties appeared likely to secure a large number of seats, including the party affiliated with Asaib Ahl al-Haq, which has moderated its tone toward the United States in recent years.\n\n“We don’t believe it’s in the Americans’ interest for Iraq to be unstable or to experience unrest,” said Mahmood al-Rubaie, the Asaib political spokesman, citing “significant American interests in Iraq.”\n\n“No company has come under any transgressions by any faction of the resistance,” he said.\n\nMr. al-Sudani has pitched himself as the leader who can balance the interests of Washington and Tehran. He has increasingly focused his messaging for the Trump administration, casting himself as an ideal, business-focused partner who has overseen several recent deals with American oil giants. He has vowed to send Iraqi billionaires to invest in the United States.\n\nIranian officials have expressed no objections to a second term for Mr. al-Sudani, Iraqi officials say. His bigger problem is his own Shiite majority.\n\nThe main Shiite bloc in Iraq, the Coordination Framework, selected Mr. al-Sudani for his first term. But he defied the bloc’s insistence that he not seek a second term, and Iraqi politicians say his rivals are now wary that he has concentrated too much power in his hands.\n\n“They will try to collapse his coalition,” said Sarmad al-Bayati, an Iraqi political analyst.\n\nHe predicted that the bloc would do the same thing it did in the last election, in 2021, when it blocked the winning coalition, led by the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, from forming a government. He then threw the Parliament into chaos when he ordered lawmakers from his bloc to resign.\n\nMr. al-Bayati said similar attempts to block Mr. al-Sudani from forming a government would be a “dangerous step.”\n\n“The next government needs to complement the wishes of the people,” he said. “And al-Sudani was the clear choice.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/fernald-state-school-disabled-people.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"10:11:41-05:00","title":"He Died at a School for Disabled People.

Decades Later, His Brother Sought Answers.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T10:11:41-05:00\n\nDavid Scott rose around 7 a.m. that day, as he did every day, and helped his son Michael get dressed and into his wheelchair. Then he found some free time to look at his phone.\n\nIt was March 2021. Sitting on his bed in Brockton, Mass., he typed in a search for the “Fernald school,” the state school for disabled people where his oldest brother, John, had lived and died decades earlier.\n\nJohn’s name had rarely been spoken of in the Scotts’ household. To Mr. Scott, he was more of a specter than a brother. Now retired, Mr. Scott had questions, and time to look for answers.\n\nHe tapped on a link. Someone had listed the names of a few hundred people buried in unmarked graves near the Fernald campus. Mr. Scott swiped through the roster.\n\nRalph R. O’Connell. Gertrude Willwerth.\n\nHis fingers stilled. John Scott. C-154.\n\nFinally, he knew where John was. Now he needed to know who he was. It would take three years, the generous help of a local historian and a personal appeal to the governor to find out.\n\nJohn Scott was paralyzed in both legs when he was born in June 1955. He had a severe form of spina bifida, a condition in which the spine and the spinal cord don’t form properly. At 18 days old, he was admitted to the Walter E. Fernald State School in Waltham, Mass.\n\nThe Fernald, as many locals refer to it, was one of hundreds of public institutions across the country for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. At their peak in the mid-20th century, these institutions held hundreds of thousands of people, some all but forgotten by their families. After reports of widespread abuses and an outcry from disability rights advocates, most of them were shuttered.\n\nIn Massachusetts alone, a special commission estimated there were at least 10,000 unmarked graves for people who had been in institutions like the Fernald.\n\nMr. Scott is 59. The youngest of seven children, he doesn’t know whether his parents, now deceased, wanted to give up their firstborn child. At that time, it was common for doctors to pressure, or even force, parents to send their disabled children to institutions. Mr. Scott’s parents, who were not highly educated, lived on government assistance and did not own a car, may not have known how to fight for John.\n\nLooking back, Mr. Scott believes his parents were traumatized by losing not just one but two young children. Their second child, Cathy, was born with spina bifida one year after John, but she stayed at home with them and died at 13 months.\n\nGrowing up, David visited John once or twice at the Fernald, when a relative with a car was in town, but he does not remember anything about him. He said his siblings had a few faint memories of John but never got to know him because he was so young when he went to the Fernald.\n\nIn 1973, John died at the school. He was only 17; David was 7. He does not remember going to a funeral.\n\nWhen David turned 14, his father died. Overcome with grief, he resolved not to say anything to his mother that could further upset her. She died in 2000.\n\nAs an adult, Mr. Scott stayed busy working 60-hour weeks as a garbage collector and raising his own family. John was rarely in the front of his mind.\n\nThat changed in 2001, when his youngest son, Michael, was born with cerebral palsy. When Mr. Scott heard the diagnosis, his first thought was of John. “Maybe this is God’s calling for me,” he surmised. He saw Michael’s birth as a second chance for a family that once handed a child to the state.\n\nAfter splitting with Michael’s mother when Michael was little, Mr. Scott took custody of him and his two other sons. He resolved to give Michael the life he believed John never had. He moved into a single-story house and bought an accessible van. Michael lived at home, attended public school and went to summer camp. He loved watching sports and playing video games with his friends.\n\nIn time, Mr. Scott became increasingly interested in John and the Fernald. When he saw his brother’s name online that morning in 2021, he immediately reached out to the person who posted the list of graves.\n\nAlex Green, who owned a bookstore in Waltham and now teaches at the Harvard Kennedy School, became interested in the history of the Fernald after customers told him about a nearby cemetery, just up the road and through the woods. They said it was filled with hundreds of deceased from the school and the neighboring Metropolitan State Hospital, an asylum that housed people with mental illnesses.\n\nThe graves were marked with letters indicating the religion of the dead, and a number signifying the order in which they were buried.\n\nMr. Green began to take walks there, joined the city’s historical commission and soon began his own personal research project on the Fernald. (He later helped create the commission that investigated the state institutions.) Through this work, he began teaching disability history at a high school near the cemetery.\n\nHe had an idea: What if he collaborated with students to identify the names of every person buried in the cemetery?\n\nStrict state laws prohibited them from easily obtaining the names and medical records of those buried. But as word of their project spread through Waltham, a former Fernald employee asked him to meet her at a Dunkin’ coffee shop. She handed him a handwritten register with the name of every person buried in the cemetery. Mr. Green and his students set to work.\n\nAfter they started posting information online, Mr. Green got a call from Mr. Scott. John’s biography on the website, just a few sentences long, was already more information than the little Mr. Scott had.\n\n“I can’t believe you know so much about my brother,” he told Mr. Green. “I don’t know anything.”\n\nAccording to the scant records Mr. Green and the students collected, John was buried on March 20, 1973, five days after his death. He died of “congestion in his pulmonary artery” and “edema with insufficiency,” or improper blood flow to his limbs and through his heart.\n\nMany of the 296 people in the cemetery were immigrants, victims of institutional abuse or people whose families couldn’t afford another burial option, Mr. Green explained.\n\nMr. Green told Mr. Scott that there was a chance the state archives held some of John’s patient records. It might be difficult to get them, but Mr. Green would do everything he could to help.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, there was another way Mr. Scott could learn more. His students had interviewed a few former Fernald employees, and one teacher, Susan Weiner, spoke about John, who had been her student.\n\nIn conversations with Mr. Scott and an interview with The New York Times, she described John as “a little ray of sunshine” who was chatty and one of her brightest students. Ms. Weiner remembered an art lesson where the students created self-portraits. She could still picture John’s — he had drawn himself from the waist up.\n\nShe recalled attending a burial service for John with just a few other people present — a Catholic priest, a nurse who brought John home for Christmas, his physical therapist.\n\nMr. Scott told Mr. Green he would like to see John’s grave. Mr. Green said they could do better than that. He had arranged memorial services for other families of Fernald students. Why not have one for John?\n\nMr. Scott pulled his white van into the parking lot on a sunny afternoon in May 2021, with Michael in the back. The dirt path leading to the cemetery was inaccessible for Michael, so the state agency that maintained the grounds lifted his wheelchair into the back of a pickup truck. Mr. Scott, holding a bouquet of flowers in one hand and his Bible in the other, felt chills as he walked behind the truck.\n\nA couple of dozen people — Mr. Scott’s siblings and their families, Mr. Green and his students, Ms. Weiner and others from the community — were already gathered on the grass with red carnations in their hands.\n\nHolding his breath, Mr. Scott said, he found his way to John’s grave, a small concrete block sunk into the uneven ground. It was hidden by grass, and the etched “C-154” was fading. He pictured the place where his parents and his sister, Cathy, rested, with its beautiful, embellished gravestones, and felt almost sick.\n\n“That’s how much dignity they buried him with?” he recalls thinking. “That’s all his life meant?”\n\nJohn’s memorial was a grand affair compared with what Mr. Scott imagined his first service was like. A Catholic priest presided, and someone played the cello.\n\nBut Mr. Scott was not at peace. The cemetery was on the bottom of a hill near a marsh, and most of the graves were filled with water. For all he knew, John’s remains had long since been washed away.\n\nThere was much more he needed to know.\n\nMr. Scott got nowhere at first. A lawyer for the state told him that the patient records from John’s era at the Fernald had all been destroyed. Even if they existed, he was told, he would need to become the executor of his brother’s estate to get them. It could be a difficult, expensive process.\n\nMr. Scott stayed up late into the night reading about how, in the 1940s and ’50s, boys at the Fernald were unknowingly exposed to radiation in an experiment led by Harvard and MIT professors and sponsored by Quaker Oats. The research was meant to study how cereal affected the way the body absorbed minerals.\n\nHe also asked more questions of Ms. Weiner, the former teacher. She became more candid, telling Mr. Scott she hadn’t believed her students were treated well.\n\nSometimes John came to class and “stunk to high heaven,” she said, because his colostomy bag was overflowing and his clothes were soiled. Another student was sexually and physically abused by an attendant, she said, although that had not happened to John.\n\n“Eighty percent of the stuff that I saw there, I wish I could erase from my mind,” Mr. Scott said she told him.\n\nStill hoping to find records, Mr. Scott hired a lawyer, chased down his siblings for signatures and raised money to help cover the costs. He waited and waited. Many of his emails were ignored.\n\nThen, in early 2024, The Boston Globe reported that the Fernald had been vandalized. Thousands of private patient records were littered across the abandoned campus. Some were covered in graffiti or urine. Some were even popping up on eBay.\n\nMr. Scott was furious. He had spent thousands of dollars and countless months trying to get his brother’s records from the Department of Developmental Services, and the same agency had proved unable to keep the documents safe. (In March 2024, the department retrieved most of those documents and placed them in storage).\n\nHe marched to the Boston Public Library, where Maura Healey, the governor of Massachusetts, was holding a public forum broadcast by a local radio station, GBH. Dressed in a red hooded sweatshirt, his hands clasped respectfully in front of him, he told Ms. Healey about John. Michael was at his side.\n\n“I am trying to gain the records for my brother,” he began, his voice breaking. “I was 7 years old when he passed away.”\n\n“The atrocities that occurred at that school, what my parents had to endure by having him taken away, the whole thing, it’s really affected me,” he continued.\n\nHe implored Ms. Healey to release the records. “Please, please,” he begged. “For my brother and a lot of other families’ sake.”\n\nMs. Healey appeared to be touched.\n\n“I want you to have closure,” she said. “I want you to have peace. Both in John’s memory and for your own self and your son.”\n\nA few days later, he received an email from a lawyer with Developmental Services. John’s records existed, and Mr. Scott could have them.\n\nIn April 2024, in a state office in Boston, Mr. Scott signed a form and someone handed him a rust-colored accordion folder. Just like that, John’s records were finally in his hands. Seventeen years of life laid out in 70 documents.\n\nMr. Scott, Mr. Green and Michael went to a cafe next door and pored over them. They were all out of order, but as Mr. Scott flipped through the pages, a faint picture of his brother started to emerge.\n\nThe first pages were math worksheets and spelling tests that showed what John’s handwriting looked like. Mr. Scott noticed some of the tests had perfect scores.\n\nA doctor’s report detailed how John was speaking in full sentences at age 4 and knew the name of every employee in the building. “I have high hopes for his future,” John’s nursery teacher wrote in another letter.\n\nBut other records painted a picture of a mental decline, attributing the “depression” of his I.Q. score to “his deprived life circumstances.”\n\n“As long as he remains in this present environment his mental and social development will remain stunted,” a 1967 progress report read. One teacher wrote that John should be transferred to another school before his skills were “lost completely.”\n\nJohn had health problems that included a severe kidney infection and a deep, open sore on his left knee, the records showed. Mr. Scott tried to piece together how those conditions might have contributed to his death.\n\nThere was also a neurological report from 1967, when John was about 12.\n\n“He does not know where he was born,” it said. “He knows that his mother’s name is Mrs. Scott; however, he does not know her first name. He knows that he has three brothers and one sister. He does not know their names.”\n\nMr. Scott felt guilty reading that. And it broke his heart to see a note saying, “John discovered girls this year and can be quite a flirt.”\n\n“My brother could have had a relationship,” Mr. Scott said. “He was a typical boy.”\n\nAnother note said John could catch and throw a ball well. Mr. Scott thought of Michael, who enjoys playing baseball, and imagined his brother and son playing catch in the backyard.\n\nSometimes he thinks of moving Michael to a group home or residential care facility because he is tiring as he gets older and knows he won’t be around forever. But he always comes back to John.\n\n“I can’t,” he said. “Not after what happened to my brother.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/newsom-aide-corruption-charges.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:50:15-05:00","title":"Former Aide to Gavin Newsom Charged With Corruption","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former chief of staff to California Governor Gavin Newsom, Dana Williamson, has been charged with 23 counts of federal crimes, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, fraud, and obstruction of justice, related to diverting $225,000 from a dormant campaign fund of former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.

Gavin Newsom of California has been charged with conspiring to skim $225,000 from a dormant campaign fund that belonged to a top Biden administration official.\n\nThe former aide, Dana Williamson, 53, was charged by a federal grand jury with 23 counts, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, according to an indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday. She was also accused of illegally writing off $1 million in vacations, luxury purses and private jet travel as business expenses on her federal income tax returns.\n\nMs. Williamson pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing on Wednesday in Sacramento and was ordered to be released on a $500,000 bond.\n\nEric Grant, who was named the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California in August, said the Wednesday arrest stemmed from an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was in office. It involves a campaign fund that belonged to Xavier Becerra, a former California attorney general who served as the health and human services secretary under Mr. Biden.\n\nMs. Williamson is well known in California political circles as a fierce power broker with ties to top Democratic officials and deep experience on policy matters. She served in high-ranking positions for two governors, ran Mr. Becerra’s 2018 campaign for attorney general, and was known at the State Capitol as an effective deal-maker who could bring peace among warring factions. She served for about two years in the Newsom administration before she left in November 2024.\n\n“Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,” Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Governor Newsom, said on Wednesday. “While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”\n\n“At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one’s peers,” Mr. Gardon added.\n\nThe campaign fund transfers, prosecutors said, enriched Sean McCluskie, the longtime chief of staff for Mr. Becerra, who was California attorney general from 2017 to 2021.\n\nFederal authorities accused Ms. Williamson of working with Mr. McCluskie and another political consultant based in Sacramento, Greg Campbell, to direct $225,000 from Mr. Becerra’s campaign accounts to Mr. McCluskie from 2022 to 2024. The payments ultimately went to Mr. McCluskie’s spouse for a “no-show” position, according to court documents.\n\nIn a plea agreement, Mr. McCluskie said that he had taken a pay cut when he went to Washington to work for Mr. Becerra at the Department of Health and Human Services, and that his salary was not covering his expenses, but that he was generally prohibited by government ethics rules from receiving outside income.\n\nIn early 2022, the plea agreement said, Mr. McCluskie met with Ms. Williamson, who was then in private practice, and agreed to a plan in which they would charge Mr. Becerra’s dormant campaign account $7,500 per month as a fee for managing the money, and then funnel it through Ms. Williamson’s consulting business and Mr. Campbell’s public affairs firm to Mr. McCluskie’s wife.\n\nLater that year, as Ms. Williamson was preparing to transition into a public sector job in the Newsom administration, she met with Mr. McCluskie and told him she could no longer continue their arrangement, but that she had found a new public affairs consultant to take over for her, the plea agreement said.\n\nMr. McCluskie agreed in October to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud; Mr. Campbell agreed earlier this month to plead guilty to the same crime, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nThe indictment, which was first reported by The Sacramento Bee, describes Ms. Williamson and Mr. McCluskie as misleading Mr. Becerra about aspects of their plans to use his campaign funds. It also accuses Ms. Williamson of filing false tax returns claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for expenditures such as Fendi and Chanel handbags, home improvements including a new HVAC system, a luxury hotel stay for Ms. Williamson’s birthday, and a $10,000 cash gift to a relative.\n\nMr. Becerra, who was not charged with any crimes and is running in the 2026 race for California governor, expressed dismay at the developments.\n\n“The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted adviser are a gut punch,” Mr. Becerra said about Mr. McCluskie, in a statement. “I have voluntarily cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice in their investigation, and will continue to do so. As California’s former attorney general, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.”\n\nMs. Williamson previously served in the Democratic administrations of the former governors Jerry Brown and Gray Davis. A Newsom administration official, who did not want to be named because the official was not authorized to talk about the investigation, said that Ms. Williamson was placed on leave last year after she informed the office that she was interviewed by federal investigators and was under criminal investigation.\n\nNews of the arrest stunned her longtime friends in Sacramento political circles, some of whom heard as they were at a luncheon to discuss the 2026 elections.\n\n“I’m shellshocked,” said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist and a friend of Ms. Williamson’s. “Dana is as good as it gets.”\n\nMs. Williamson appeared in handcuffs in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday afternoon, with glasses perched on her nose and her brown hair swept into a bun. She listened solemnly as Judge Carolyn Delaney read the charges against her, and as her lawyer entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf.\n\nMs. Williamson briefly turned around to look at the reporters sitting in the back of the courtroom. At one point, she raised her cuffed hand awkwardly to wipe a tear from her eye.\n\nShe faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. She faces less time for other counts, such as conspiracy to obstruct and making false statements.\n\nMatthew Rowan, Ms. Williamson’s attorney, argued that she should not be held in jail before trial because she had no criminal history and was facing health problems.\n\nProsecutors said they had produced more than 27,000 pages of discovery and 752 gigabytes of iCloud data that would be part of their case. The next court date was set for Dec. 11.\n\nMr. Rowan declined to speak with reporters at the courtroom.\n\nSeamus Hughes contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/world/americas/gustavo-petro-colombia-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:13:30-05:00","title":"The Rebel Turned President Willing to Take On Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Gustavo Petro of Colombia has engaged in a high-stakes political confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump, refusing to resume intelligence sharing and accusing the U.S. of extrajudicial killings in maritime operations targeting Colombian fishing boats.

of Colombia.\n\nWhile many have treaded carefully since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Petro has infuriated him, blocking deportation flights, standing on the streets of Manhattan urging U.S. soldiers to disobey orders and accusing the United States of “murder” in its boat strikes in the eastern Pacific.\n\nOn Tuesday he announced the suspension of any intelligence sharing with the United States as long as the boat strikes continue.\n\nMr. Trump has responded by calling Mr. Petro an “illegal drug leader’’ and his administration has yanked his visa and put him on a sanctions list usually reserved for major criminals and human rights violators.\n\nFor Mr. Petro, a former rebel during Colombia’s long and brutal internal conflict, defiance is nothing new. Those who know him describe a man propelled by his convictions — a lifelong critic of corruption and inequality who became the fiery face of Colombia’s left.\n\nThat same impulse, they say, now fuels his willingness to take on Washington, even as his government is hobbled at home by persistent violence, scandal and cabinet upheaval.\n\nTo admirers, his confrontation with Mr. Trump is the biggest battle of a decades-long crusade against the powerful. To detractors, it’s a reckless display of ego, and shows a leader more focused on promoting himself as a global moral champion than on governing effectively at home.\n\nColombia’s ambassador to Washington, Daniel García-Peña, lauded Mr. Petro for pushing necessary debates onto the world stage.\n\n“I think that he’s on the right side of history,” he said at his home in Bogotá after Mr. Petro briefly recalled him during a recent diplomatic spat. “He has been in my view very, very brave to be able to to stand up and to say what he believes.”\n\nBut Mr. Petro’s former education minister, Alejandro Gaviria, who resigned in early 2023 after objecting to a proposed government health measure, said that while he might have “a genuine concern” for humanity, he did not “internalize the consequences, impacts, or effects on Colombia.’’\n\nThat tension, between ambition and diplomacy, has defined his recent standoff with Washington. The United States revoked his visa in September after, speaking at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York, he called on American soldiers  to disobey Mr. Trump.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has accelerated a campaign to destroy boats and kill crew members it says were smuggling drugs. Many legal experts have called it extrajudicial killing.\n\nThe attacks started in the Caribbean but spread to the eastern Pacific and hit boats Mr. Petro said were carrying Colombians.\n\nAfter he accused the United States of murdering a Colombian fisherman, Mr. Trump threatened aid cuts and tariffs, accused Mr. Petro of being a drug kingpin and imposed some of the most severe sanctions in the U.S. arsenal on Mr. Petro, his relatives and his interior minister.\n\nThe confrontation has won Mr. Petro praise from the global left, but alarmed many at home, where Colombia depends on the United States for trade and counternarcotics cooperation.\n\nCritics say his foreign policy approach is ideological rather than pragmatic.\n\nMr. Petro, Mr. Gaviria said, thinks “he is expressing truths that no one else is expressing.”\n\nA former environment minister, Susana Muhamad, said caution had never been Mr. Petro’s style.\n\n“His entire political life has been about taking risks,” she said. “Walking the edge of the abyss to push for change, to create tension, to expose what’s really going on.”\n\nBorn to a government auditor and homemaker, Mr. Petro joined the M-19, a leftist militia, at 17, appalled, he said, by the poverty near his home outside Bogotá.\n\nSmaller than the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which operated from rural strongholds and raised money through the drug trade, the M-19 drew urban students, activists and artists challenging what they saw as an elite oligarchy.\n\nThe group tried to cultivate a Robin Hood image, robbing milk from trucks and distributing it to poor neighborhoods.\n\nThough less ruthless than other insurgents, it carried out one of the deadliest acts of Colombia’s decades-long internal conflict: the 1985 siege of the national judicial building, which left 94 dead in clashes with the police and the military.\n\nMr. Petro, at the time imprisoned for his M-19 membership, was not involved and has said he was tortured in prison.\n\nHe later helped negotiate the group’s 1990 peace deal with the government, transforming the M-19 into a political party that helped draft Colombia’s 1991 Constitution, which emphasizes equality and human rights and is considered one of the most successful byproducts of the peace process.\n\nMr. Petro soon entered Congress, gaining prominence for exposing ties between paramilitaries and politicians — revelations that led to dozens of indictments but earned him powerful enemies in a country polarized by a complex war among left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the state.\n\nHe became admired by progressives and distrusted by conservatives, who have never let go of their belief that Mr. Petro is, at heart, an unyielding leftist insurgent.\n\nIn a country where class hierarchy is literally codified — neighborhoods are ranked from one to six, poorest to richest — Mr. Petro challenged Colombia’s hereditary elite. He embraced his outsider image, favoring jeans and open-collars and quoting Foucault, casting himself as both an intellectual and a man of the people.\n\nAs Bogotá’s mayor from 2012 to 2015, he cut public transit fares and subsidized water for the poor, cementing his progressive reputation but frustrating critics who saw him as an idealist uninterested in the daily demands of running a sprawling, chaotic city.\n\nIn 2022, he won the presidency, becoming Colombia’s first leftist leader, a watershed in one of Latin America’s most conservative nations that captured global attention.\n\nHe promised sweeping social and economic transformations, but critics say he has fallen short. While he has advanced land redistribution and environmental initiatives, Mr. Petro’s pledge to bring lasting peace to a country scarred by decades of bloodshed has faltered, and his popularity has fallen.\n\nConservative critics denounce his guerrilla past and his rapprochement with Venezuela’s autocratic government, and criticize him for giving ex-combatants a formal role in the peace process.\n\nDisillusionment has spread even on the left.\n\n“His administration has been disastrous,” said María Jimena Duzán, a prominent Colombian journalist who supported his candidacy. “His policies — many of which are very good and truly innovative — were never implemented.”\n\nKnown for bold initiatives and an authoritarian streak, he has often clashed with advisers, including Mr. García-Peña, who resigned as director of international relations over another official’s dismissal, calling Mr. Petro “a despot.” Mr. Petro later appointed him as ambassador to the United States.\n\nMr. Petro’s long, often digressive speeches — sometimes infused with conspiracy theories — deepen perceptions of a presidency adrift.\n\nHe has warned of a Dubai-based criminal network supposedly targeting him, claims the police say lack conclusive evidence.\n\nIn a rambling post addressed to Mr. Trump in January, he mentioned “Washington’s Black neighborhoods,” the singer Paul Simon, Egyptian pharaohs and his experiences with gastritis.\n\nMs. Duzán has asked whether substance abuse might be behind his extended absences and disjointed social media posts. A former minister has also publicly accused him of drug use. Mr. Petro dismissed that, responding that “the only addiction I have is to coffee.”\n\nSupporters say efforts to portray him as erratic or incompetent are part of a coordinated backlash from political and media elites who resent his power.\n\nBut while Mr. Petro has long been targeted by elites, he takes it a step further and “feels that everyone is always persecuting him,’’ said Federico Gómez Lara, the director of a Colombian political magazine, Cambio.\n\nMr. Petro’s clash with Mr. Trump has divided Colombians over whether to confront or appease Washington. Mr. García-Peña argued that appeasement has failed other nations and said Mr. Petro’s defiance has earned him admiration at home and abroad.\n\nStill, unease is spreading in the Bogotá establishment, Mr. Gaviria said. “There’s a sense that the environment is becoming increasingly unstable,” he said. “That Petro no longer has any limits.’’\n\nOfficials are eager to play down the feud with Mr. Trump as a misunderstanding.\n\nDefense Minister Pedro Sánchez said Mr. Petro was “obsessed with combating drug trafficking” and the interior minister, Armando Benedetti, said that “our major failure has been that we have not been able to get that message across to Trump.”\n\nBut Mr. Gómez Lara thinks the president relishes the conflict.\n\n“Gustavo Petro has always lived within a logic of confrontation,’’ he said. “He needs an enemy in order to function. It was the paramilitaries, then the political class, then Netanyahu,” a reference to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n“Now it’s Donald Trump,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/opinion/shutdown-democrats-senate-midterms.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"05:03:25-05:00","title":"Democrats Sure Taught Trump a Lesson","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the political dynamics following a brief government shutdown, contrasting the resignation of Senate Democrats to a compromise with President Trump’s unpopularity revealed at an N.F.L. game.

Taught Trump a Lesson\n\nPublished: 2025-11-12T05:03:25-05:00\n\nAt roughly the same time that Senate Democrats were readying themselves to cave to their Republican colleagues on Sunday — effectively ending the weekslong government shutdown without any real concessions on health care policy — President Trump was getting booed by the crowd at an N.F.L. game between the Washington Commanders and the Detroit Lions.\n\nTrump, the first sitting president to attend a regular season N.F.L. game since Jimmy Carter in 1978, wants the Washington Commanders to name their planned new stadium in his honor, as a tribute to his time in office. He probably arrived at the game thinking the fans would cheer him. Instead, he faced the jeers of thousands of angry people.\n\nYou could imagine, if this were a film, an editor cutting between the two moments: the surrender of Senate Democrats back to back with the weakness of an unpopular president. You might even say, in fact, that it was a little too on the nose — a contrast too apt to be believed. Less than a week after winning landslide victories in bellwether races in Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats ceded their political advantage to a man who is as unpopular as a president can be in the current era.\n\nTo extend a little fairness to Senate Democrats — and I do mean the 47-member caucus and not just the eight defectors — you can see some of the logic of their position. They are in the minority, which in the modern Congress means they have little, if any, power, influence or authority. Yes, they have made great use of the shutdown as a political tactic, but as far as policy goes, they’re still as far away from Republican concessions on the central issue of the confrontation — health care, here taking the form of Obamacare subsidies — as they were at the start of this drama.\n\nIn fact, the Republican Party has shown that it won’t budge on anything that it actually cares about — and it cares about its program of austerity and retrenchment. So much so that both the White House and congressional Republicans were willing to starve families or leave them bankrupt with unaffordable health care costs rather than open the government on terms the Democratic Party as a whole might accept.\n\nIn the face of a Republican Party that would not yield, Senate Democrats had a choice. They could continue the shutdown — threatening the livelihoods of federal workers and those families that rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or they could hold the line long enough to force Republicans to follow Trump’s lead and nuke the filibuster to end the showdown.\n\nI think Democrats should have welcomed this outcome, as the filibuster is a fatal obstacle to even the most moderate Democratic legislative agenda. But since it does not seem that Senate Democrats agree, they took the option that made the most sense to them: a short-term deal that restores SNAP benefits, reinstates federal workers and brings the Affordable Care Act’s insurance subsidies to a promised vote later this year. (It has essentially no chance of passing.) And when the money runs dry for most of the government at the end of January, Democrats will take another bite at the apple.\n\nAgain, I can see the logic. I can even see the larger perspective. In this understanding of the overall political environment, Trump is no different from any president who overreaches in pursuit of his agenda. Last week’s elections were one predictable backlash, and another is on the horizon. Chastened by voter discontent, Republicans will retreat and try to salvage what’s left of their political position. It is, in other words, an ordinary moment that calls for ordinary politics.\n\nBut this view is wrong. This isn’t an ordinary moment. The president is openly lawless. After firing thousands of civil servants and slashing entire agencies, he has turned much of what’s left of the federal government into a tool of authoritarian consolidation. He’s transformed the nation’s immigration enforcement agencies into a de facto secret police force, terrorizing communities across the country. He wants the National Guard to occupy American cities and has publicly mused about sending the military against protesters. He’s turned the Department of Justice into his personal law firm as well as the enforcement arm for his efforts to suppress dissent and force the institutions of civil society into compliance with his will. And his supplicants in Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, are willing and eager to sacrifice their independence as constitutional actors on the altar of his personal rule.\n\nThis extraordinary reality calls for something different from the usual approach. Senate Democrats may think they are fighting to position themselves for crossover votes in the midterm elections, but they are actually in a battle for self-government itself — for democratic freedom and the rule of law. In that fight, the goal of any legislative strategy should be to inflict as much pain on the ruling party as is feasible. Democrats were, up until this week, meeting the task at hand. The polling was clear: Republicans were losing the shutdown. Americans were souring on Trump even more than they already had. And nearly half of them were willing to keep the government on hiatus if it meant Congress would retain enhanced tax credits for health insurance.\n\nBut if it appears that a feckless set of Senate Democrats have looked a gift horse in the mouth, it is also important not to over-read the electoral implications of this week’s maneuver. Next year’s midterm elections won’t be shaped by the Democratic Party’s congressional posture as much as they will be by the public’s view of Trump. And there is no reason to think that its view will improve.\n\nThe president does not know how to save face or change course. His go-to move is to escalate, whether or not it is effective. He doesn’t swerve away from his most unpopular positions; he drives full speed in their direction. You can imagine a world in which these tendencies were mitigated by strong advisers willing to give good counsel. But this is the exact opposite of the actual case. Two of Trump’s most influential counselors, Russell Vought and Stephen Miller, are uncompromising ideologues more interested in pushing their extreme agendas than they are in Trump’s political standing.\n\nIf a large part of the job of president is to receive and manage information, then Trump has constructed an environment in which he rarely if ever hears anything contrary to his own perception of the world and is rarely if ever challenged on his decisions. This means he cannot respond to political conditions on the ground. His decision to go to an N.F.L. game — in the Washington area, of all places — is instructive. It is the choice of a president who does not understand that he is unpopular and will not listen to anyone who tries to tell him to think about the optics of a potentially hostile crowd. The president is flying blind and headed straight for a mountain.\n\nAll of this is to say that Democrats will probably do well next year, especially if there is a crisis or disaster between now and next November. The problems come afterward, if and when they hold power in Washington. The task of a new Democratic Congress will be to hold the president accountable, to curb his lawlessness, to investigate his administration and to lay the groundwork for the reconstruction of the federal government in the wake of the implementation of Project 2025 and the president’s reactionary terror.\n\nIf they win, Democrats will have to use their newfound authority to rethink, even dismantle, agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. They may need to walk back the Bush-era decision to consolidate those agencies and others under a single department, given the wild abuses perpetrated under this administration and its predecessors. It will need to give serious thought to major political and social reform, including D.C. statehood, a federal ban on partisan gerrymandering, a new voting rights act and federal protections for reproductive rights and bodily autonomy, including the rights of gender and sexual minorities. Democrats will also need to embrace the legislature’s constitutional authority to structure the executive branch and the judiciary, up to and including Supreme Court reform.\n\nIf they win next year, Democrats will need to treat the next Congress not as a return to the status quo ante but as the beginning of a new era in which the principal task is to roll back the president’s effort to create and consolidate a personalist dictatorship. They’ll need to fortify the American political system against future attempts to play dictator and lay out a project of genuine democratic renewal. None of this is possible without a willingness to use power rather than just hold it. What we’ve seen this week is that there are still too many Democrats whose instinct is to retreat to normalcy rather than face the conflict at hand.\n\nDemocratic voters have shown over the last 10 years a remarkable amount of pragmatism when it comes to confronting Trump. But it is clear from the mass protests of the past few months that their patience is running thin. They want lawmakers who understand the stakes of the moment. They want leaders more inclined to fight on every front than retreat in the face of pressure. They want Grants, not McClellans.\n\nIt is not too late for Democrats in Congress to show the fighting spirit that their voters want to see. At the very least, they should consider the consequences for their own careers if, and very likely when, rank-and-file Democrats decide that their patience has run out.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It is a glossy photo book full of fashion. It is the story of the expectations that were heaped upon the first Black first lady. And it is the third installment of a trilogy of books by Mrs. Obama that focus on self-realization, including her memoir, her advice book on overcoming adversity and, this time, a meditation on the power of clothes.\n\nBut most of all it is a historical document, capturing a pivotal moment in the evolution of the role of first lady when clothing became an even bigger part of communication. When, in other words, dress became an officially recognized part of the job. That’s a bigger deal than it might appear.\n\nMrs. Obama was, after all, the first first lady to have a stylist — or “valet,” as Meredith Koop was called — on the East Wing payroll, one employed to help define the visual strategy of the first lady for every occasion, from public hula hooping to major moments of pageantry.\n\nBefore the Obamas entered the White House, first ladies like Jacqueline Kennedy, Nancy Reagan and Hillary Clinton may have worked with a designer on their dresses for inaugural balls or state dinners, but the relationship was more grace and favor than structural. It was more about pageantry and propriety than diplomacy, and the first ladies tended to choose one designer (Oleg Cassini, James Galanos, Oscar de la Renta) and stick with him.\n\nAfter Mrs. Obama, however, Melania Trump and Jill Biden each employed a stylist — Hervé Pierre for Mrs. Trump and Bailey Moon for Dr. Biden — who served as a liaison between fashion brands and the East Wing. They worked with many designers, for pretty much every occasion, often with a specific set of political priorities in mind. A new template had been created, and it became the norm.\n\nWhy that happened is, in large part, the subtext of “The Look,” which was released by Crown last week, and it is why the book matters. It lays bare, in an unprecedented (and easy-to-read) way, how a wardrobe was transformed into a vehicle of soft political power.\n\nIn some ways, it was unavoidable.\n\nAs the first Black first lady, Mrs. Obama knew that her every move was sure to be scrutinized, including every outfit. She had to represent all sides of a fractious country, and she had to do it as the first first lady of the social media age. The ability of the world to see and track her every appearance was far greater than it had ever been, and the ability of the world to comment on her every appearance was also greater. Her image — the pictures making their way around Instagram and Twitter and Facebook — mattered in a way it never had before, and thus the choices involved with creating that image mattered. The stakes had changed when it came to clothes.\n\nAs Mrs. Obama admits in the book. There had been speculation about the purpose behind many of her fashion choices as first lady in a number of books, including “Everyday Icon” by Kate Betts and “Michelle Obama: First Lady of Fashion and Style” by Susan Swimmer (not to mention in numerous articles by critics like me). But this is the first time she has overtly addressed the subject of her style and credited the team — Ms. Koop, the stylist; the hairdressers Yene Damtew, Njeri Radway and Johnny Wright; the makeup artist Carl Ray — that helped make it happen.\n\nThus, she writes, the decision to choose Jason Wu, then a young, relatively unknown Taiwanese-born New York designer, to design her inaugural gown was about demonstrating “that I was going to champion people and voices and talents that were too often overlooked.”\n\nOnes who, she went on, “represented the diverse talent of American fashion design that I wanted to showcase to the world.”\n\nThus the approximately 100 different looks from Mrs. Obama’s time as first lady memorialized in “The Look,” not counting what she wore during the campaigns or after the Obamas left the White House. That’s a lot of clothing for one woman to wear, or shop for, in only eight years.\n\nEspecially when the criteria for each look being chosen also included diplomatic outreach, as when Mrs. Obama turned to a designer whose background bridged the United States and one of its allies for a state dinner or visit — all the better to, as she writes, “pay respect.” (See, for example, the dress by Tom Ford, an American designer working in London, that she wore during her state visit to Britain; or the gown by Versace, the Italian brand, she wore for the Italy state dinner.)\n\nEspecially when there were also practical concerns to take into consideration — not just the mores of different countries, but the fact that Mrs. Obama’s clothes couldn’t restrict her movement, had to allow her to hug someone if desired and had to be invulnerable to makeup that might rub off during contact.\n\nThough Mrs. Obama writes about all of that in “The Look,” as well as the often racist criticism she received for wearing sleeveless dresses, one subject she avoids is cost. She does note that she tried to introduce “affordable but fashionable brands into my closet,” including J. Crew, but there’s no avoiding the fact that acquiring this many outfits is an enormous expense — a burden borne by the first family, not the state. One of the ways this cost is managed is for a designer to “gift” an outfit for a major public event to the country, which means that while the first lady may wear a gown once or twice, it goes into the national archive or a presidential library rather than her closet.\n\nStill, that doesn’t change the takeaway of “The Look.” Just how much Mrs. Obama adapted her own style to the style she felt the country needed became obvious once she left the White House, with her subsequent book tours and related fashion experiments. A Canadian tuxedo! Thigh-high Balenciaga boots! Straight-from-the-runway Chanel!\n\nAnd that further underscores the point of this book: For any first lady selecting the (many) garments that will define her tenure is not something that happens by accident. Nor should it be: It’s work.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/upshot/teachers-survey-chromebooks-class.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:10:06-05:00","title":"350 Teachers on How Screens Take Over Classrooms, as Early as Kindergarten","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 2025 New York Times survey of 350 U.S. teachers reveals that nearly all schools now provide students with personal devices from kindergarten through 12th grade, with Chromebooks being the most common.

accessible and engaging.\n\nChristina Barreto\n\nSixth grade, Yonkers, N.Y.\n\nTeachers are constantly competing with their Chromebooks for attention.\n\nWesley Lima\n\nHigh school English, Dartmouth, Mass.\n\nDevices should be treated like cigarettes for kids.\n\nJoshua Lemere\n\nSixth-grade English, Westminster, S.C.\n\nSupported by\n\nEven as schools have banned phones, a Times survey shows how the pandemic-era practice of giving students their own laptops and tablets is here to stay.\n\nBy Claire Cain Miller and Sarah Mervosh\n\nAmerican classrooms have been transformed by screens in the last five years, with most students, of all ages, now learning on computers or tablets during the school day.\n\nEven as schools have moved rapidly to ban cellphones, screens are nearly universal: Ninety-nine percent of teachers said their school provided devices to students for use in class, in an informal national survey of 350 pre-K through 12th-grade teachers conducted by The New York Times in October.\n\nEight in 10 teachers said students at their school had a device assigned to them, compared with about a third who said that was the case in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nAnd of elementary schoolteachers, 81 percent said students at their school receive devices for use in class by kindergarten.\n\nIn a separate Times questionnaire, sent to the 20 largest U.S. school districts, nearly all said they provide devices to students starting in kindergarten or earlier.\n\nThe results show how technology has become ingrained in schools, with computers often used for required curriculum, standardized testing and even free time. Google Chromebooks are the most common device.\n\nOnline learning has brought important benefits, teachers said, like preparing students to use technology in their future careers, and enabling them to research topics online.\n\nBut it has also introduced new problems, with concerns about distraction and screen time mounting among both teachers and parents as U.S. test scores decline.\n\nLandon Durtschi\n\nHigh school history, Bronx\n\nJason Zimmerman\n\nHigh school math, Kansas City, Mo.\n\nIn the survey, which included respondents from 40 states and Washington, D.C., nearly three-fourths of teachers who use devices in their classrooms said they distract from student learning and engagement in class, and a majority said children in their classrooms had used them to play games or watch videos unrelated to school.\n\nExcludes teachers who say students don’t use devices in their classroom.\n\nStill, about seven in 10 teachers said that if it were up to them, they would choose to use devices in their class at least some of the time.\n\n“It’s not either/or for me,” said Bill Heuisler, a high school history teacher in Los Angeles. “It’s about wisely using technology” only when necessary, he said.\n\nMany schools began providing laptops to students in the 2010s. But the vast embrace of technology, for students of all ages, accelerated because of the pandemic.\n\nWhen schools went remote in 2020, districts across the country rushed to buy every student a personal device, and the business of education tech exploded, with districts investing in online apps and curriculums.\n\nIn the survey, about half of teachers said their school’s core curriculum required students to work online.\n\nMore than two-thirds said student work time on devices had increased from prepandemic levels.\n\nIn elementary classrooms, most teachers estimated that students use them for an hour or less a day. The youngest students, unable to read or type, listen on headphones and use touch screens, teachers said, and need exposure to devices because most standardized tests are now given online.\n\nKarissa Mallory’s first graders in Detroit use devices to take district tests and to work with an A.I. tutor on their reading skills.\n\nThree- and four-year-olds in Lupita Villalobos’s district in Duncanville, Texas, use iPads to play learning games or listen to stories, she said. But she has opted out of using them in her own pre-K classroom, because she finds that children this age learn better through hands-on, play-based activities.\n\nIn middle and high schools, four in 10 teachers said students spend three hours or more a day on devices. Cedric Jacobson, a high school teacher in Boston, said students use devices in science to see interactive simulations; in math to do practice sets that adapt to their level; and in the humanities to draft and revise work.\n\nThey offer “tremendous potential to advance student learning and understanding,” he said. But he has also observed that students have become less persistent in searching for answers, “blindly trusting” what they find on Google or A.I. chatbots.\n\nIn the district questionnaire, officials from the largest school districts said technology was a key to their academic and equity goals. They said devices can offer students individualized lessons at their level, provide real-time translation for students learning English — 10 percent of the U.S. school population — and support students from low-income families, who may not have access to a computer at home.\n\n“Access to reliable technology and high-speed internet is a modern-day necessity, and, right now, too many New York City students don’t have it,” Mayor Eric Adams, who oversees the nation’s largest school district, said while announcing 350,000 new Chromebooks, equipped with 5G internet, for students this fall.\n\nYet even as schoolwork moves online, schools rarely teach students basic digital skills. Less than one-fifth of teachers surveyed said their districts taught students to type proficiently.\n\nRoughly 80 percent of teachers said their district provided Chromebooks for students. The second-most common device was an iPad.\n\nAndy Russell, a product manager at Google who oversees Chromebooks in schools, envisions them ushering in a new era of education — one in which teachers aren’t lecturing in front of the room, but rather acting as facilitators to students learning on computers and using online tools to creatively show what they’ve learned.\n\n“So much of what teaching is today is not the when and the what, like I learned; it’s a lot more of the how — this is how we make a video, this is how we build infographics,” he said.\n\nHe said Google had heard from teachers that distractions were a problem. Last month, Google began offering them new tools, including the ability to see live feeds of students’ screens and to lock screens so students can’t do anything other than the assigned lesson.\n\nIt also automatically disables YouTube on educational accounts and allows schools to set devices to turn off at a certain time at night. (Many districts choose to allow YouTube, and just 4 percent of teachers surveyed said their school put screen time limits on devices.)\n\nOverall, teachers expressed mixed feelings about devices. They said devices had made grading easier, allowed them to give real-time feedback to students and supported their ability to work with small groups, while others worked independently online.\n\nLaura Lou Delehanty\n\nHigh school English, Leeds, Ala.\n\nFifth grade, Denver\n\nAmy Rosenstein\n\nThird grade, Ardsley, N.Y.\n\nBrent Aaron Chapuis\n\nSecond grade, New Orleans\n\nMany teachers also have deep concerns.\n\nThough nearly all said their schools used content blockers, students often find ways around them.\n\nIncreasingly, teachers said, students are also using A.I. to take shortcuts. Google search, the default on most Chromebooks, now presents A.I.-generated summaries at the top of search results, which some teachers said discourages students from digging deeper.\n\nElexia Strickland\n\nHigh school English, Richmond, Texas\n\nMike Sullivan\n\nMiddle school math, Brockton, Mass.\n\nStephanie Lewis\n\nLibrary, Horseheads, N.Y.\n\nMiddle school English and social studies, Pleasanton, Calif.\n\nMany teachers worry that computers at school simply add to this generation’s total screen time. Teachers described students with weakened spelling and handwriting skills, diminished imaginations and less stamina to focus on arduous tasks that are not as engaging as apps that make lessons into video games.\n\nThere is little evidence from high-quality studies on how technology affects students’ outcomes.\n\nSome teachers and parents are pushing back.\n\nFor parents, school-issued laptops, which often come home, especially with older students, are yet another screen they have to monitor — and one largely outside their control.\n\n“You have this extremely powerful technology that is designed to be addictive,” said Miriam Kendall, the founder of a parent group called Screen Sense Evanston, which is pressing the school district in Evanston, Ill., to establish screen-time limits during the school day and reduce sending devices home.\n\nThe district announced earlier this year that it would remove YouTube from student devices.\n\nSome teachers have begun using devices only when essential, and returning to pencil and paper for everything else.\n\n“I will be the first to admit, I was swept up in the ed tech craze earlier in my career, but the payoff has not been there,” said Jill Anderson, a third-grade teacher in Ossining, N.Y., who said she was “devastated” about the effects of computers in classrooms.\n\nThis year, she is limiting devices to required tests, students’ final writing assignment and a lesson on technology.\n\nKathleen Price, who teaches middle school English in Charlotte, N.C., said students in her class read paper books, write by hand and use red pens and highlighters to annotate text. “I think they actually love having a break from screens and getting a chance to engage in deep reading, discussion and activities,” she said.\n\nProduced by Alice Fang. Graphics by Francesca Paris.\n\nAbout the data\n\nThe Times’s survey was circulated to members of the American Federation of Teachers, a union; Educators for Excellence, a teacher-led advocacy group; Teach for America’s alumni group; and teachers’ Facebook groups. Responses were recorded from Oct. 6 to Oct. 25. The results are not a statistical sample of all U.S. schools.\n\nThe 350 teachers who responded taught in 40 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C. Roughly 60 percent taught in urban schools, more than the national share. Thirty percent were from suburban schools and 10 percent from rural ones. Two-thirds said they worked in low-income schools that receive federal Title I funding, similar to the share of those schools nationwide.\n\nFor each question, The Times removed respondents who answered “I don’t know.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/climate/greenhouse-gas-emissions-china.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:00:07-05:00","title":"Carbon Dioxide Emissions Head for Another Record in 2025","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Global carbon dioxide emissions are projected to reach a record high in 2025, increasing by 1.1% from 2024, with the United States and much of the rest of the world seeing significant rises.

2025-11-12T19:00:07-05:00\n\nGlobal fossil fuel emissions are on track to soar to record highs in 2025 and show no signs of declining overall, although there are indications of a recent slowdown in China’s emissions, researchers said on Wednesday.\n\nThis year, nations are projected to emit roughly 38.1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide by burning oil, gas and coal for energy and by manufacturing cement, according to data from the Global Carbon Project. Those sources are the largest contributors to human-caused climate change. The total is roughly 1.1 percent more than the world emitted in 2024.\n\nNot everywhere saw a large increase. Emissions appear to have stayed nearly flat in China and Europe, but rose significantly in the United States and much of the rest of the world.\n\nSource: Global Carbon Project\n\nBrad Plumer/The New York Times\n\nThe increase in emissions comes a decade after world leaders reached a landmark agreement in Paris that aimed to slow and then stop the planet from warming. Doing so would require global emissions to peak at some point and then fall to nearly zero. That task becomes harder every year that emissions go up.\n\n“It is 10 years since the Paris Agreement was adopted, and despite progress on many fronts, fossil carbon dioxide emissions continue their relentless rise,” said Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo and one of the authors of the report.\n\nDefenders of the Paris Agreement point out that emissions are now rising more slowly than they otherwise would have, as many countries shift to less polluting forms of energy. Technologies like solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles are proliferating rapidly, raising hopes that emissions might peak soon.\n\nSo far, however, that hasn’t happened.\n\nA relatively small number of countries account for most of the world’s emissions, with China responsible for 32 percent, the United States at 13 percent, India at 8 percent and the European Union at 6 percent.\n\nThe new report did contain one surprising finding: China’s emissions seem to be flattening after decades of breakneck growth, although there is some uncertainty because of lags in collecting data.\n\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, Chinese emissions soared as the country built hundreds of coal plants to fuel its industrial expansion. More recently, though, China has been installing enormous amounts of wind and solar power, and roughly half of all new cars sold in the country are now electric.\n\nWhile the country still gets most of its energy from coal and other fossil fuels, the report estimates that its emissions will only rise about 0.4 percent this year, and could even end up declining. (A separate analysis by Carbon Brief, a climate research site, found that China’s emissions have plateaued for the past 18 months even as electricity demand has surged.)\n\nStill, some experts said it was too early to say that China’s emissions have peaked.\n\n“There is no clear peak” yet, said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher at CICERO. “The outlook going forward is highly uncertain due to policy changes that reduce economic incentives for renewable power and expected growth in the use of coal to produce chemical feedstocks.”\n\nPresident Xi Jinping of China said this year his country would cut carbon dioxide and other pollution by at least 7 percent by 2035. But he made no promises on how high emissions might climb over the next few years before the cuts start.\n\nIn the United States, emissions are expected to rise roughly 1.9 percent for this year, in part because last winter was relatively cold and homes used more energy for heating. Electric utilities also burned more coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels, as the country looked to export more natural gas, a lower-carbon alternative.\n\nU.S. carbon dioxide emissions passed their peak years ago and have been declining over time, although many analysts expect them to fall more slowly under the Trump administration, which has disavowed efforts to tackle global warming and has sought to promote greater use of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nIn many countries, annual variability can have an even bigger effect on emissions than policies or technology. Emissions in Europe may have risen slightly this year, around 0.4 percent, in part because of a relatively cold February and a drop in power supplies from hydroelectric dams. Conversely, an early monsoon in India led to a relatively cool May and June, which meant the country needed to burn less coal than expected during those months.\n\nIn the rest of the world, emissions increased roughly 1.1 percent this year. International air travel increased especially rapidly and has rebounded to levels seen before the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe report did find small signs of progress on climate change. There were 35 countries that saw a consistent decrease in their emissions over the past decade, up from 21 countries in the decade before.\n\nYet at this month’s U.N. climate summit in Belém, most leaders have conceded that the action to date has not been sufficient.\n\n“Yes, progress has been real,” Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said on Monday. “But it’s not nearly enough.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/briefing/epstein-trump-congress-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:47:50-05:00","title":"Jeffrey Epstein Discussed Trump in Emails Released by Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major political development, Democrats in Congress released three emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate that allegedly suggest President Donald Trump had personal knowledge of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation, including claims that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s house and knew about the underage victims.

Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, suggested that President Trump knew more about his abuse than Trump has acknowledged. In one of the messages, which you can read here, Epstein wrote that Trump had “spent hours at my house” with one of Epstein’s victims.\n\nHouse Republicans responded about two hours later by releasing the rest of the material Congress had obtained from the Epstein estate — roughly 20,000 documents in all — and condemned Democrats for cherry-picking emails that mentioned Trump. My colleagues and I spent much of the day reviewing the trove. We’re updating what we’ve learned so far here.\n\nThe trove of Epstein emails includes several references to Trump, including one in which Epstein described the president as “borderline insane.” In another, he asserted that Trump “knew about the girls,” many of whom were later found by investigators to have been underage. Many of the other emails were innocuous.\n\nTrump has emphatically denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation. He has said that he and Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal prison in 2019, were once friendly but had a falling out. He accused Democrats of releasing the emails to distract from the government shutdown.\n\nStill, the White House appeared to be rushing to prevent additional revelations. Senior Trump aides met in the White House Situation Room today with Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican who is backing an effort to force a House vote on whether to demand the release of more files related to Epstein.\n\nIn other Trump administration news:\n\nIsaac Herzog, Israel’s president, said that Trump asked him to pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not been convicted.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who currently oversees the I.R.S., used a tax dodge that the agency has tried to stop.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives returned to Washington today for their first session in 54 days. They are tasked with approving a Senate bill to end the longest government shutdown in American history. The vote is likely to be tight, but the chamber’s Republican leadership is expected to get it passed.\n\nDemocrats are still fighting over the deal that a small group of them made to end the shutdown. Many in the party are unhappy that they were unable to secure the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, but some believe the fight effectively highlighted issues like health care and food aid that could benefit them come election time.\n\nFor more: We asked five Democratic voters to weigh in on the shutdown-ending deal.\n\nThe American penny, which came to life 232 years ago under the oversight of Alexander Hamilton, was officially retired this afternoon. The final pennies, minted in front of top Treasury officials in Philadelphia, each cost some 3 cents to make — a financial absurdity that doomed the coin.\n\nFear not, the penny will not vanish just yet. There are still roughly 250 billion of them in circulation, and they are very, very rarely used to help pay for something.\n\nMost students now use computers or tablets during the school day. In a survey of 350 pre-K through 12th-grade teachers conducted by my colleagues, 99 percent of teachers said their school provided devices for use in class. Only about a third of teachers said that was the case before the pandemic.\n\nSee what teachers told us about the benefits and drawbacks of in-school technology.\n\nSouth Asia: Bombings in the capital cities of India and Pakistan, though they have not been directly connected, raised fears of another conflict between the countries.\n\nMiddle East: Israel said that it had reopened the Zikim border crossing into northern Gaza, a longstanding request from aid organizations.\n\nHealth: At a conference in Geneva, researchers at the forefront of animal-human transplantation allowed themselves the first real optimism in decades.\n\nTech: New cases have sought to define content created by artificial intelligence as defamatory.

But our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, sees it instead as a historical document.\n\nThe book, Vanessa writes, captures a pivotal moment in the evolution of the role of first lady when clothing became an even bigger part of communication. For the first first lady with a stylist on the East Wing payroll, fashion was no longer just fashion; it was a vehicle of soft political power.\n\nWhen José Antonio Morante Camacho announced his retirement last month, the world of bullfighting lost its biggest star. Known across the Spanish-speaking world as Morante de la Puebla, he was considered a legend of the ring, beloved for his artistry, courage and imagination.\n\nEven the Spaniards who wanted to ban bullfighting often appreciated Morante, 46, for his bravery in publicly wrestling with mental health problems.\n\nDutch beauty: Leiden has all of the canals and charm of Amsterdam, with none of the crowds.\n\nThe pitch: Can soccer stadiums revitalize American cities?\n\nMind control: Every four years, people compete to see whose brain-computer interface holds the most promise.\n\nLose something?

to be one of the first in Russia, face-planted during its highly anticipated debut in Moscow on Tuesday after briefly staggering onstage.\n\nOrganizers quickly dragged the machine away, raising a black drape to shield it from about 50 journalists who had gathered to watch the demonstration, an inauspicious entry for Russia into the increasingly competitive international space of A.I.-powered robots resembling humans.\n\nThe anthropomorphic robot, known as AIDOL, appeared to lose its balance after waving to the audience. It keeled over moments later, faster than Ivan Drago, Rocky Balboa’s vanquished Russian rival in “Rocky IV.”\n\n“At first, there was a moment of silence,” Dmitry Filonov, editor in chief of Edinorog Media, who was in the audience and covers technology start-ups, said in a text message on Wednesday. “Then they began to applaud to show their support.”\n\nThe robot’s developer, a company also known as AIDOL, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nOrganizers attributed the robot’s problems to calibration and lighting issues, according to journalists who attended the event.\n\nVladimir Vitukhin, AIDOL’s chief executive, told the Russian state news agency Tass that the robot was still in the stages of learning.\n\n“I hope this mistake will turn into an experience,” he said.\n\nThe robot’s developers suggested on a website for the project that the A.I.-embodied machine could walk, handle objects and communicate with people. That could make it attractive for a host of potential uses, they said, including in the automotive industry, warehouses and medicine, as well as for entertainment.\n\nDozens of companies — from lesser-known start-ups to technology Goliaths — are planning to sell humanoids and get them into homes and businesses.\n\nIn 2024, investments in humanoid technology surpassed $1.6 billion, a sum that did not include a multibillion-dollar infusion from Elon Musk and Tesla, his electric car company, into Optimus, a humanoid they began building in 2021.\n\nMr. Filonov said it was not unusual for robotics start-ups to experience growing pains, pointing to the company Boston Dynamics as another example. A few years ago, it compiled a blooper reel featuring its Atlas robot that drew widespread attention online.\n\nWriting on his Substack blog before Tuesday’s event, Mr. Filonov said the AIDOL robot was expected to have mobility issues.\n\nHe said that the vast majority of humanoid robots don’t have faces, but that the developers of AIDOL had told him they had invested heavily in its face and in technology that is meant to mimic humans.\n\n“I think that they were just unlucky,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/movies/sally-kirkland-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"17:20:50-05:00","title":"Sally Kirkland, Scene-Stealing Actress, Dies at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sally Kirkland, an actress known for her bold, sassy, and politically charged performances, died at 84 in Palm Springs, CA.

She was seemingly ubiquitous but never quite a star.\n\n“Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,” the critic Sheila Benson wrote in her review of “Anna” for The Los Angeles Times. “There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.”\n\nAt 5-foot-10, she once said that producers believed she was too tall to be cast in traditional romantic leads. Still, she won a starring role in “Anna,” a drama with comic flourishes directed by Yurek Bogayevicz, who co-wrote the screenplay by the Polish-born Agnieszka Holland, who went on to become an award-winning director and screenwriter.\n\nMs. Kirkland played the title role — a fading Czech movie star once imprisoned for anti-government protests after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now living in exile in New York, she is struggling to revive her career when she meets an innocent young fan and fellow Czech refugee (played by the former fashion model Paulina Porizkova) who, after receiving mentoring and a makeover from Anna, sets her sights on stardom herself.\n\nDespite being known for her broad, sassy and very American personality, Ms. Kirkland did not consider the role of Central European screen siren much of a departure.\n\n“I think I’m more European in personality,” she said in a 2000 interview with MoXie Magazine, a women’s publication. “My attitude is always one of sensuality, aggressive enthusiasm and a kind of outrageousness in my expression. I suppose if I wanted to be the girl next door, I could have been.”\n\nShe lost the Oscar to Cher in “Moonstruck” but received a torrent of strong reviews.\n\nEven when the roles were small, her presence was unmistakable. She brought her trademark sexuality and swagger to “The Sting” (1973), playing the vampy stripper love interest of Robert Redford’s con artist character.\n\nShe delivered a brief but searing performance in Oliver Stone’s “JFK” (1991) as an exotic dancer compatriot of Jack Ruby, a club owner in Dallas who later shot and killed Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. And she wrung humor and pathos out of her turn as a fading rock star in “Revenge” (1990), a romantic thriller starring Kevin Costner and Anthony Quinn.\n\nHer other appearances included the romantic drama “The Way We Were” (1973), starring Barbra Streisand and Mr. Redford, and the comedies “Private Benjamin” (1980) starring Goldie Hawn and “Bruce Almighty” (2003) starring Jim Carrey. She also worked for decades on television, with guest appearances in shows like “Kojak,” “Three’s Company,” “Charlie’s Angels” and “Felicity.”\n\nSally Kirkland Jr. was born on Oct. 31, 1941, in Manhattan to Frederic McMichael Kirkland, a product of Philadelphia’s Main Line and a scrap metals merchant, and Sally Sr., a fashion editor at Life magazine for decades.\n\n“My name was Sally Kirkland Jr., so I had a huge insecurity problem about being the daughter of a famous woman whose byline was Sally Kirkland,” she said in a 2013 interview with the film site Money Into Light. But, she added, “I’m sure I would never have been an actress if it was not for her being so totally in the public eye and putting me at age 5 in front of the camera to be a model.”\n\nAs for acting, “I started when I was 10,” she said, “and I was very very shy, and it was a way for me to hide behind characters so the real Sally Kirkland wouldn’t have to emerge.”\n\nIn her teens, she fell under the tutelage of the Oscar-winning actress Shelley Winters, who helped guide her into the Actors Studio workshop. There, she studied under the Method acting guru Lee Strasberg.\n\nShe began appearing Off Broadway in the early 1960s and, as a habitué of Mr. Warhol’s Factory scene, earned her first credited screen role in the Pop artist’s 1964 experimental film “The 13 Most Beautiful Women.”\n\nShe also performed Shakespeare with Joe Papp’s Public Theater and gained a reputation for her willingness to disrobe onstage in more avant-garde fare, like the 1968 Off Broadway production of “Sweet Eros,” a one-act play by Terrence McNally. A Time magazine critic called her “the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism,” but Ms. Kirkland called the nudity “symbolic” and critical to the point of the show, not meant to titillate.\n\nHer reputation for skin-baring was such that in 1969 she wrote an essay explaining her motives in The New York Times: “I came to the theater, as others have, by way of painting and dance. As a painter, I had for my heroes Botticelli and Modigliani; as a dancer, Isadora Duncan, and so the carry-over on to the stage of the nude body seemed to me not only stylistically expressive, but a perfectly natural extension of my beliefs.”\n\nThose beliefs included a fierce opposition to the Vietnam War. “The nude body onstage was the Truth,” she added. “Vietnam the Lie.”\n\nAlong with her sexualized persona came a reputation for dating famous men.  Of the 35 films she’s starred in, she confessed in a 1990 interview with the television host Rick Dees, she was romantically linked to their leading men “at least eight times.” “I love men,” she added. “I just do.”\n\nOne paramour, she said, was Bob Dylan, whom she had met while waiting tables in Greenwich Village in the 1960s, and later connected with in Los Angeles in the 1970s. “I was obsessed,” she said in a 2023 interview with The Daily Mail. “Oh, God, yeah. He is the reason I am single and is definitely the love of my life.”\n\nHer marriages to the singer and composer Michael Jarrett and to the music producer Mark Hebert ended in divorce. Information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nMs. Kirkland received an overdue star turn last year playing herself in the independent film “Sallywood,” a gentle parody about a longtime fan of the actress who becomes her assistant and helps her in her quest to return to red-carpet glory.\n\nIn a video interview last year, Mr. Gruber recalled Ms. Kirkland’s response after she first read the script: “Oh, you wrote me as the world’s biggest narcissist, and I can’t wait to play myself this way!”\n\n"}]}
