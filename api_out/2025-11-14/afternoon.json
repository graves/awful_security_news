The company’s stock recently hit all-time highs. Sales are surging, even as rivals such as Target, Home Depot and others slump. And Walmart raised wages and expanded benefits, becoming a business school  case study  on employee retention.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that is thanks to McMillon, who announced Friday that he’s  retiring  soon as CEO. He oversaw Walmart’s transformation from a brick-and-mortar discount superstore that largely appealed to lower-income Americans to an everything store, everywhere for everyone.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon, a Walmart lifer who took the top job at 47 as the company’s youngest CEO since founder Sam Walton, reinvented Walmart by threading one of the thinnest needles in retail: reaching new shoppers online while retaining old customers in stores. Walmart under McMillon used its unparalleled size to press suppliers into keeping prices ultra-low, all while adding new higher-end brands and growing online to attract a wealthier clientele.\n \n\n   \n  And McMillon accomplished this pivot while navigating contentious political and social issues in America that have engulfed many companies, such as Target and Bud Light.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon’s successor, veteran Walmart leader John Furner, will have to handle these challenges, as well as pressure from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and an uncertain future of shopping with AI.  Walmart  recently said it’s partnering with OpenAI to let users browse and make purchases directly through chatbot ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n    Walmart’s transformation\n \n\n   \n  Low and middle-income shoppers historically formed the customer base of Walmart’s superstores in rural and suburban America.\n \n\n   \n  But Walmart has increasingly drawn higher-income customers in recent years. Shoppers making more than $100,000 a year have  fueled  Walmart’s growth in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart’s grocery business has underpinned its success. More than half of Walmart’s sales come from groceries, and the company has used its size and scale to muscle down prices and  invest  in improving its meat and produce aisles. That has benefitted Walmart throughout McMillon’s tenure, particularly during the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent America searching for value that Walmart could help deliver.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Walmart under McMillon has built a strong e-commerce business to compete with Amazon and draw shoppers online. It has added the option to buy online and pick up in store to thousands of its locations and Walmart+, its same-day grocery delivery membership.\n \n\n   \n  Although Amazon leads e-commerce sales in the United States by a wide margin, accounting for 40.6% of sales,  Walmart comes in second  with 9.4%, according to market research firm eMarketer.\n \n\n   \n  “The most notable change during McMillon’s tenure has been Walmart’s evolution into a major e-commerce company,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n    Political culture wars\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also has deftly steered Walmart through political culture wars on guns, LGBTQ rights, immigration, the Confederate flag and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart, historically a conservative company based in deep-red Arkansas, appeals to a wide swath of America.\n \n\n   \n  It has worked carefully to stake out positions in the political middle to avoid offending customers and employees, and taken a slow, gradual approach to changing policies such as  gun and ammunition  sales. Dan Bartlett, the former communications director for President George W. Bush, has helped shape Walmart’s do-no-harm public affairs strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “Politics moves around,” McMillon  said  in a 2017 interview. “We are on our 11th administration, since Walmart was born. There will be a 12th. There will be a 13th.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-student-murders-restitution","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Convicted killer Bryan Kohberger must reimburse families for their daughters’ urns","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty in 2025 to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students—Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves, and Maddie Mogen—is now ordered by an Idaho state judge to reimburse the families of Goncalves and Mogen for the cost of their urns.

University of Idaho students he killed, an Idaho state judge ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s ruling comes after prosecutors asked the judge at a hearing last month to require the convicted killer to pay about $3,000 to reimburse the families of  Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen  for the urns carrying their ashes.\n \n\n   \n  Kohberger, who was set to go to trial in the summer, struck a deal with prosecutors in June that allowed him to escape the death penalty if he  pleaded guilty to the November 2022 murders  of Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Mogen and Goncalves.\n \n\n   \n  Kohberger’s attorneys argued he does not have the money to pay the additional restitution to the families, let alone the already-agreed-upon more than $30,000 in restitution   required through his plea agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Steven Hippler said in a written ruling that Kohberger can raise the money through donations or a job in prison to cover the additional funeral costs.\n \n\n   \n  The judge noted Kohberger amassed nearly $29,000 from several hundred donations since his arrest in a case that drew national attention with a cross-country manhunt following the fatal, nighttime stabbings that stunned a college town. Kohberger’s defense team has said most of the money came from his family members paying to communicate with him in jail and public donations have slowed since he pleaded guilty to the killings.\n \n\n   \n  “While these funds may no longer be available to Defendant, it is foreseeable he will continue to receive donations in the future, particularly given that much of the donated amounts came from his family,” Hippler wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, there is no reason Defendant cannot secure prison employment for remuneration. Given his limited needs in prison and his youth, it is foreseeable that through employment and donations, Defendant may receive sufficient amounts over his life to at least come close to meeting his financial restitution obligations.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/banksy-girl-with-balloon-theft-man-jailed-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00Z","title":"Man Jailed for Stealing Banksy’s ‘Girl with Balloon’ Print in Smash-and-Grab London Robbery","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Fraser, a 49-year-old man from London, was sentenced to 13 months in prison for stealing a signed 2004 print of Banksy’s iconic 'Girl with Balloon' artwork during a smash-and-grab robbery at the Grove Gallery in Fitzrovia.

A man has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for stealing a signed print of Banksy’s “Girl with Balloon” artwork in a smash-and-grab theft from a London gallery.\n \n\n   \n  Larry Fraser, 49, was sentenced to 13 months in prison on Friday for stealing the 2004 print – worth £270,000 (about $355,000) – from the Grove Gallery in the British capital’s upmarket neighborhood of Fitzrovia last September, according to London’s Metropolitan Police.\n \n\n   \n  Police said Fraser had pleaded guilty to one count of non-residential burglary.\n \n\n   \n  “Met Flying Squad officers worked tirelessly to identify the suspect and managed to track him to a location several streets away, where he was revealed to be Fraser,” police said in a statement Friday. “They even caught him on CCTV loading the artwork into a van before fleeing the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  The Flying Squad, a specialist unit within the Metropolitan Police tasked with investigating serious organized crime, recovered the artwork within four days, following Fraser’s arrest and “covert enquiries,” police said.\n \n\n   \n  Art recovery expert Arthur Brand told CNN that it was notable that the stolen artwork was a print, because these are often easier to sell than original works. “It is easier to sell a print because there are more of them. If you steal a painting, which is unique, it’s very hard to sell,” Brand said.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking about the police’s response, Brand said: “It’s pretty quick what they did … It shows that if the police want to catch you, they can. There are CCTV cameras everywhere, especially in England.”\n \n\n   \n  In a video shared online by police, a hooded man can be seen smashing the glass door of the gallery before climbing into the building and taking the print off the wall.\n \n\n   \n  The manager of the gallery, 29-year-old Lindor Mehmetaj, said he was “completely shocked” by the robbery while thanking police for their “remarkable” response, in a statement shared by police.\n \n\n   \n  Detective Chief Inspector Scott Mather, who led the police investigation, said that Banksy’s “Girl with Balloon” piece is known “across the world.”\n \n\n   \n  “We reacted immediately to not just bring Fraser to justice but also reunite the artwork with the gallery,” Mather said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The iconic image of a girl reaching out for a red, heart-shaped balloon by the anonymous British graffiti artist hit the headlines in 2018 when the painting  self-destructed just moments after being sold  for $1.4 million.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/boat-strikes-trump-due-process-polling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:08:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s boat strikes appear quite unpopular, as Americans again support due process","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes how public opinion in the United States is increasingly turning against President Donald Trump's controversial military strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, which lack legal procedures or judicial oversight.

But didn’t Americans just want undocumented immigrants deported? By standing up for due process, didn’t Democrats risk looking like they were siding with people in the country illegally – or even alleged gang members?\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turned out Americans could separate those two things in their minds. In large part because of the heavy-handedness of his deportations, Trump’s immigration agenda has suffered a series of defeats in court and  fallen out of favor  with the public.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reducing the number of illegal border-crossings to  record lows , Trump is somehow  underwater on immigration  polling.\n \n\n   \n  We could now be seeing a similar dynamic playing out with Trump’s  legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats  in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out these strikes without a legal process or offering public evidence of its justifications. The administration has likened the fight against drug-traffickers to a literal war and  said that allows it  to use war-like powers.\n \n\n   \n  Despite carrying out these strikes for more than two months and  killing 80 people now , we hadn’t had a good read on public opinion – until now. And it turns out, much like with the rapid deportations, the American public has real concerns.\n \n\n   \n  A new  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released Friday found Americans oppose such strikes by a wide margin, 51%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  The question asked whether people supported “authorizing the US military to kill suspected drug traffickers outside of the US without judicial process.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents opposed this 53%-22%. About twice as many Americans overall strongly opposed it (34%) as strongly supported it (15%). And even 27% of Republicans opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  Those are the kinds of numbers that would seem to suggest real political danger for Trump – and might embolden Democrats or other critics to start speaking out a little more forcefully.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the extraordinary nature of these strikes and major legal questions hanging over them, those critics thus far have been relatively quiet. And they certainly haven’t sought to elevate this issue to a top priority.\n \n\n   \n  We do have the likes of libertarian Republican Sen. Rand Paul speaking out pretty forcefully. Paul has called the strikes “extrajudicial killings.” He and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with nearly all Senate Democrats last month to rein in Trump’s authority on the boat strikes, although the measure ultimately did not pass.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawmakers have agitated for more briefings from the administration, which hasn’t publicly offered a legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s clear Democrats have decided to treat the issue somewhat gently, perhaps fearing they will look like they’re standing up for drug-traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, even  expressed confidence in the underlying intelligence . Warner suggested that, whatever other concerns people have about the strikes – and he expressed worries himself about the administration’s transparency – they shouldn’t be too concerned about them hitting innocent people.\n \n\n   \n  But just days later, the Associated Press reported that some who were killed in the strikes appear to have been  small-time criminals and amateurs , rather than the “narco-terrorists” the administration has said it’s targeting.\n \n\n   \n  This appears very much a live issue that will keep evolving. And the survey suggests those who would raise concerns have plenty of the public behind them.\n \n\n   \n  But actually, that shouldn’t be too surprising.\n \n\n   \n  Over and over again, polls have suggested the American people are actually quite interested in upholding the principle of due process – the principle that says, yes, these might be criminals, but we should probably make sure of that and have some accountability. And that even goes for noncitizens.\n \n\n   \n  A May  Public Religion Research Institute poll  showed Americans opposed the government deporting undocumented migrants to prisons in El Salvador and other countries “without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court,” 61%-37%.\n \n\n   \n  A June  poll from Vanderbilt University  showed support for deportations dropped from 51% to 39% when you add the qualifier that it would be done “without a formal hearing before a judge in an immigration court.”\n \n\n   \n  And a May  Reuters-Ipsos poll  showed Americans said 55%-41% that people suspected of being in the country illegally were entitled to due process. Independents agreed with that 63%-36%, and even 22% of Republicans agreed.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll see if these data – and perhaps the recent election results suggesting Trump is at a low point politically – inject lawmakers with more willingness to fight this battle.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, the downside of not speaking out more forcefully also appears to be coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Just this week, a report from human rights groups alleged that dozens of Venezuelans who were sent to the El Salvador prison were  subjected to torture  and other serious abuses like sexual violence. The report also echoed previous reporting that, contrary to the administration’s claims, there is little evidence many of these migrants were the hardened criminals or gang members the administration said they were.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could understand why Americans might be skeptical of not just imprisoning people without due process, but killing them.\n \n\n   \n  And it seems they are.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-epstein-doj-investigate-enemies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:52:00-05:00","title":"Trump Says He’s Asking Justice Department to Investigate Epstein’s Ties to Slew of High-Profile Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s relationships with numerous high-profile individuals, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, and J.P.

Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later on Friday confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump’s orders, assigning Jay Clayton, the top prosecutor in New York’s southern district, to lead the federal probe.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you, Mr. President,” she wrote in a  post on X  that included a screenshot of Trump’s request.\n \n\n   \n  The move represents the president’s most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of Trump’s belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Why doesn’t he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he’s in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump earlier this week  tried and failed  to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department’s Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.\n \n\n   \n  Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert unreleased documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee but they could not change her mind.\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails released earlier this week “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration’s response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump doesn’t want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn’t prove anything,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  The president has declined to take questions from the press since the House Oversight Committee’s release on Wednesday of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.\n \n\n   \n  He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.\n \n\n   \n  In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director.

Gaza have received “hundreds of pleas for help,” Mahmoud Basal, the spokesperson for Gaza Civil Defense, told journalists, “but the resources are nonexistent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Entire shelter centers

Mattresses are soaked, blankets are drenched and there are no options left — because every option has been destroyed by Israel,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Displaced Palestinians in Gaza City told CNN that the tents people were staying in were worn out, with some collapsing under the weight of the rain.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been flooded by the rain, us and our little children,” Raed Al-Alayan said. “Our tents were flooded. There is no roof to protect us from the rain.”\n \n\n   \n  Storms are common for Gaza this time of year, but with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from permanent shelter even a normal amount of rainfall can inundate residents and exacerbate already dire conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The rain persisted in the morning, when men and women frantically attempted to mop away the rainwater that kept pouring back into their tents.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been awake since 2:30 a.m. because of the rain. Everything is soaked; the mattresses and the blankets,” Abdulbasset Abulhadi told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One woman guided CNN around and into her family’s soaked tents where she said she had 20 kids sheltering, including newborns.

Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:11 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. Staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports will be frozen at 6%, the Department of Transportation said Wednesday night, stopping short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers are now showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain at that level until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “If the FAA safety team determines the trend lines are moving in the right direction, we’ll put forward a path to resume normal operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said Tuesday that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would allow airlines to restore operations before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week if the government reopens quickly. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Andy Rose, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/nnsa-nuclear-testing-white-house-meeting-exclusive","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"Exclusive: Department of Energy officials to meet with White House to tamp down Trump’s idea of explosive nuclear testing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration officials are planning to meet with the White House to oppose President Donald Trump’s proposal to resume full-scale nuclear weapons testing, which he initiated in October 2024 in response to Russia’s and North Korea’s nuclear activities. Despite Trump’s public statements and directive to test on an 'equal basis,' NNSA officials argue that explosive testing is scientifically redundant, environmentally risky, politically destabilizing, and not necessary given existing data and advanced simulation tools. The proposed testing would require a 36-month timeline and would need approval from Nevada’s state government, facing significant public resistance due to legacy health impacts from past nuclear tests. Experts warn that renewed U.S. testing could provoke China or Russia into testing, increasing global nuclear tensions.

Williams and officials from the US National Laboratories are planning to inform the White House that they do not think blowing up weapons for nuclear warhead testing,   as Trump suggested last month, is tenable, two sources familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest sign of fallout from Trump’s October social media post instructing the Department of Defense to start testing   nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs.”\n \n\n   \n  But NNSA, which falls under the Department of Energy,   is the federal agency responsible for building and testing bombs and maintaining the nuclear stockpile, not the Defense Department.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official reiterated on Thursday that “because of other countries’ testing programs, President Trump has instructed the Department of War and Department of Energy to test our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has been eliminated from consideration as all decision-making authority lies with the President,” the White House official added.\n \n\n   \n  Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich pushed back on the idea that agency officials would be dissuading the White House from resuming testing.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration continues to explore all options as it moves to expand nuclear testing on an equal basis with other nations,” Dietderich said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the US tests every part of its nuclear weapons systems except for the explosive nuclear material in warheads. The last full-scale nuclear weapons test was done in the US in 1992, and the practice was banned by former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent suggestion the US could resume nuclear testing comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted in October that Moscow had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo.\n \n\n   \n  “The reason I’m saying — testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test,” Trump told “60 Minutes” recently. “If you notice, North Korea’s testing constantly. Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don’t wanna be the only country that doesn’t test.”\n \n\n   \n  At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there’s not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn’t involve blowing anything up, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  The source said officials hoped it would give the president the opportunity to align himself with NNSA’s approach.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has the authority to order the tests anyway if he doesn’t agree with the nuclear experts.\n \n\n   \n  An NNSA spokesperson declined to comment. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mere minutes before he was due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea last month, Trump took to Truth Social to say that he had directed the “Department of War” to “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Inside the NNSA, Trump’s initial October suggestion was met with confusion, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody saw this coming,” one of them said.\n \n\n   \n  Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, told Fox News  earlier this month  that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The official argued the president became fixated on the idea while on his trip to Asia, telling CNN that some foreign leaders brought the issue up to Trump directly while he was abroad.  \n \n\n   \n  Another   administration official argued that they viewed the president’s comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s comments haven’t changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments.\n \n\n   \n  NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing.\n \n\n   \n  “If they wanted to just make the ground shake, you could probably do that sooner, but there wouldn’t be a purpose to the test beyond political signaling,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  There is also the matter of legacy cleanup of nuclear waste due to decades of nuclear testing in Nevada. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer.\n \n\n   \n  There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear   tests — something it says  it is not currently doing  — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe.\n \n\n   \n  Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China’s nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump’s first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet. That’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"The government is back open.

Here’s what that means for economic data \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:57 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US government has reopened following its longest-ever shutdown, setting the stage for the eventual release of the gold-standard federal data that is crucial in analyzing the health and trajectory of the nation’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Data nerds  (and government officials,  and Federal Reserve policymakers , and business owners, and, well,  everyone else for that matter ),  rejoice!\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been like flying in fog without any instrumentation,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  However, expect some choppiness when the air starts to clear.\n \n\n   \n  The very nature of the 43-day shutdown has created an unprecedented situation: Some datapoints were not gathered when they typically should have been, increasing the potential for big holes in what’s expected to be already messy data.\n \n\n   \n    What major economic reports are outstanding?\n \n\n   \n  Since the government was dark for the entirety of October and the first dozen days of November, several reports that included data collected in September and scheduled to be released in the ensuing weeks were not delivered ( with the exception of the Consumer Price Index ), nor was data collected for October (we’ll get to that here shortly).\n \n\n   \n  One of the first reports expected to be released could be the September jobs report,  which was due October 3 .\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s sitting on the shelf and just needs to be released,” Zandi said. “Maybe dust [the report] off and produce a press release; but I think it should be ready to go.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible that the September jobs report could be released as soon as next week, Kevin Hassett, the White House’s top economic adviser, told reporters Thursday﻿, noting that the report has “already been cooked” (or ready for release).\n \n\n   \n  Other major reports in the wings – likely in various stages of completion – include September data on real earnings, wholesale inflation, import and export prices, quarterly employment costs, annual consumer expenditures, retail sales, gross domestic product and consumer spending.\n \n\n   \n    When will they be released?\n \n\n   \n  That remains to be seen.\n \n\n   \n  The leading statistical agencies are in the process of updating their schedules for economic releases (a calendar set in place more than a year ago).\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s not as simple as plugging reports into different dates. Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index ,  which in turn feeds in to GDP.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday posted  a placeholder link  where revised release dates will be posted. As of Friday morning, it had yet to be updated.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis – the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies – announced it is “working to update its schedule of economic releases” and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA’s indicators.\n \n\n   \n  Early Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers’ shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Each economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n \n\n   \n  Still, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritize  Principal Federal Economic Indicators , which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover  Survey , for example, is not).\n \n\n   \n    Will we ever see the October jobs report?\n \n\n   \n  As it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a “lost” month of data – or close to it.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, the nation’s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended – disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it’s bound to be unreliable,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “I think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.”\n \n\n   \n  The household survey is what’s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate ,  and since that wasn’t conducted in October, “we’re going to get half the employment report,” Hassett  said on Thursday . “We’ll get the jobs part, but we won’t get the unemployment rate.”\n \n\n   \n  The lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn’t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembled   using the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist for RBC in a note Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    October inflation data likely to be quite opaque\n \n\n   \n  The  visibility on inflation  data for October will be “particularly bad,” Reid noted.\n \n\n   \n  Two-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.\n \n\n   \n  That will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,” he said. “Absent the CPI and PPI reports, it’s hard to gauge inflation’s trajectory.”\n \n\n   \n  And if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a “serious data quality issue,” as it would likely lean more heavily on  imputation , a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.\n \n\n   \n  “But we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there’s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,” EY-Parthenon’s Daco told CNN. “So, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.”\n \n\n   \n    What about November data?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month’s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC’s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.\n \n\n   \n  “BLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it’s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,” she said, referencing the Trump administration’s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while it’s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it’s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,” she said. “I would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can’t run the October [household survey] again.”\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it’s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.\n \n\n   \n    We might not be back on track until 2026\n \n\n   \n  “Noisy” reports aren’t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).\n \n\n   \n  Entering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain of  just 12,000 jobs  – a far cry from September’s 223,000-job gain.\n \n\n   \n  It was also a one-time blip.\n \n\n   \n  After striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showed  a surge of 227,000 jobs gained .\n \n\n   \n  When the October 2025 jobs report is released, it’s expected to show significant job losses – perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC’s Reid estimates – largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  And, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month – the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment – the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown gummed up the nation’s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.\n \n\n   \n  “It’ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “So, there’s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we’re going to get until early winter 2026.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street is bracing for impact\n \n\n   \n  The privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  “If they hit the mark, and that’s what they show, then no harm, no foul,” he said. “If, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect – either on the upside on the downside – then that may call into question the Fed policy that’s been done since the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  US stocks had  their worst day in a month  Thursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks’ worth of data set to be released in short order.\n \n\n   \n  “I say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,” economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN’s Matt Egan. “When the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00-05:00","title":"School shootings in the US: Fast facts","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 14, 2025, there have been 68 school shootings in the United States in 2025, with 39 occurring on college campuses and 29 on K–12 school grounds.

Jamie Raskin alleged correspondence between Maxwell and her lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Leah Saffian, a California-based attorney who has long-represented Maxwell, said in  a statement : “The release to the media by Congressman Raskin (Dem., Maryland), of Ms. Maxwell’s privileged client-attorney email correspondence with me is as improper as it is a denial of justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Saffian added that employees at the prison have been met with “appropriate consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have been terminated for improper, unauthorized access to the email system used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to allow inmates to communicate with the outside world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Bryan prison, Bureau of Prisons and the Justice Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,  released  what he said was information about Maxwell’s life inside the Bryan prison — including  special privileges  being afforded to the late-Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman — that was shared with Raskin by a whistleblower.\n \n\n   \n  The whistleblower also told Raskin that Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, is in the process of preparing to file an application for commutation. According to an email that the whistleblower shared with the committee, Maxwell wrote to Saffian in early October that she planned to send materials “through the warden.”\n \n\n   \n  House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Friday defended how they received and released the information and disputed that the correspondence was privileged.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Judiciary Committee Minority’s letter was based on a range of documents and information shared with Committee staff by a whistleblower. None of the documents shared with the Committee from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) TRULINCS system was subject to the attorney client privilege,” a House Judiciary Democratic spokeswoman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The spokeswoman pointed out that individuals have to accept a disclaimer that their activity will be monitored once logging into the prison’s systems. She said the disclaimer makes clear that DOJ may monitor the system and that users must consent to such monitoring and have no expectation that communications will stay private.\n \n\n   \n  Pertaining to attorney client privilege specifically, the Judiciary spokeswoman said the disclaimer includes this or similar language: “I understand and consent that this provision applies to electronic messages both to and from my attorney or other legal representative, and that such electronic messages will not be treated as privileged communications, and that I have alternative methods of conducting privileged legal communication.”\n \n\n   \n  Raskin offered no description of the whistleblower — a typical practice meant to protect the person’s identity. The Democratic spokeswoman added the committee “won’t comment on any information that could identify whistleblowers, including whistleblowers’ employment status” and decried “any effort by BOP to intimidate, silence, or retaliate against anyone” who shared information.\n \n\n   \n  In her Friday statement, Saffian also wrote: “Contrary to Rep. Raskin’s assertion, Ms. Maxwell has not requested a commutation — or made a Pardon — application to the second Trump Administration. Prior to any such application a Prisoner needs to demonstrate that all possible avenues of appeal have been exhausted.”\n \n\n   \n  (Raskin did not say Maxwell had requested a commutation or pardon application; he said Maxwell was in the process of working on a commutation application.)\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/sweden-bus-crash-fatalities-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:37:00.000Z","title":"Several people killed in bus crash in Stockholm, police say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus crash occurred in central Stockholm on Friday, November 14, 2025, resulting in six casualties, with no passengers on board at the time.

The Telegraph sale collapses as US private equity firm drops its bid for the UK newspaper \n       \n  By Liam Reilly, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  RedBird Capital withdrew its £500 million bid for the Telegraph Media Group on Friday, leaving the fate of the major British publisher unclear.\n \n\n   \n  “RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group,” a representative for private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners told CNN. “We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and will work hard to secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers.”\n \n\n   \n  RedBird’s decision not to pursue The Telegraph throws a wrench in the outlet’s bid to grow its business in the United States, even as its rivals — including the Daily Mail, the BBC and The Guardian — have expanded in North America over the last few years.\n \n\n   \n  The reversal comes months after RedBird announced in May that  it had reached an in-principle agreement  to acquire The Telegraph Media Group for roughly $657 million. At the time, that deal seemed to mark the end of the media company’s two-year saga   to find new ownership.\n \n\n   \n  Under the deal, RedBird was to become the sole controlling owner of The Telegraph, the right-leaning British newspaper founded in 1855. The private equity firm was set to invest in The Telegraph’s digital operation in a bid to expand the outlet’s foothold in the US and grow subscriptions overall.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph’s sale was long stymied by the British government’s restrictions on foreign government investments in media ownership, which capped foreign state-owned investments into a publisher at 15%.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird, with the help of International Media Investments (IMI) — an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed   a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family — helped the Barclay family regain control of The Telegraph in December 2023, but the British government barred the transfer of ownership.\n \n\n   \n  The May 2025 deal would have allowed IMI to retain a 15% investment, meeting that limit. However, The Telegraph’s own journalists have  questioned RedBird’s ties to China . In August, a coalition of human rights and freedom of expression organisations raised similar concerns in  an open letter  to Britain’s secretary of state for culture, media and sport.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird has denied the alleged ties to Beijing. IMI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with RedBird out of the picture, the right-leaning media empire’s future returns to a state of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “Our immediate priority is to minimise disruption to the business and work with all stakeholders, including DCMS, towards a solution,” a spokesperson for   Telegraph Media Group Holdings   told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:02:00-05:00","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the recovery of U.S. air travel after a government shutdown, which caused significant flight cancellations—peaking at 10% on November 9, 2025.

life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.\n \n\n   \n  A mix of heavy rain and strong winds moved through northern and central California on Thursday. Widespread  rainfall totals  of 1 to 2 inches were observed along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco received nearly an inch and a half of rain Thursday, almost  75% of November’s average. November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  Winds in the higher elevations gusted 60 to 80 mph Thursday with San Francisco gusts topping 50 mph.\n \n\n   \n  The winds started to ease as the system dropped into Southern California early Friday, but the flood threat is intensifying as an atmospheric river feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on both Friday and Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n \n\n   \n  An initial wave of heavy rain for southern California caused flooding and a mudslide late Thursday night on portions of Highway 101 in southern Santa Barbara County, according to the National Weather Service. This round of rain is expected to ease by Friday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  A second, more intense wave will move into the region Friday night into Saturday, with prolonged heavy rain possible. Rainfall rates could be as high as an inch per hour at times.\n \n\n   \n  This second round of rain will also have the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through 10 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service warns that the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.\n \n\n   \n    Burn scar areas on alert\n \n\n   \n  Burn scar areas from recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows. Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have warned residents near the recent Palisades, Hurst and Sunset fires’ burn scars to be  prepared to evacuate .\n \n\n   \n  “Residents, especially those in vulnerable areas, should start taking precautions immediately to prepare for the storm and protect their interests,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. “This scenario would potentially create many significant impacts area-wide, including possible debris flows in the burn areas, significant ponding of roads and highways, mudslides through the canyons, fallen trees, etc.”\n \n\n   \n  Residents can  pick up sandbags at Fire Stations  throughout the City, with sand also available for free at select locations.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest rain should ease late Saturday, but the region isn’t in the clear right away. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won’t take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/chicago-immigration-arrests-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:13:00-05:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Chicago’s Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major legal development, US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, a Biden-appointed judge, ruled that hundreds of individuals arrested during 'Operation Midway Blitz,' a federal immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas, must be released due to violations of a 2022 settlement agreement that prohibited warrantless arrests.

What happens next? \n       \n  By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:13 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump’s push to detain and  deport undocumented immigrants  en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.\n \n\n   \n  The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.\n \n\n   \n    What did the judge decide?\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was  nominated by  former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022 settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Cummings ruled  agents violated the  previously agreed upon consent decree .\n \n\n   \n  Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026,  and says  if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”\n \n\n   \n    Who will be released and when?\n \n\n   \n  Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  But two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”\n \n\n   \n    What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.\n \n\n   \n  But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.\n \n\n   \n  “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   “We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his CBP agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including  from a federal judge , for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin  previously told CNN , while  other immigration legal challenges  move through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago  amid protests against  the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Dianne Gallagher and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/americas/brazil-protesters-cop30-climate-talks-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:03:00-05:00","title":"Protesters Block Main Entrance to COP30 Climate Talks in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the start of the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, about 100 Indigenous protesters, primarily from the Munduruku group, blocked the main entrance for 90 minutes, demanding that Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva listen to their concerns about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest for agribusiness.

protesters  blocked the main entrance to the  United Nations climate conference  on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon for 90 minutes on Friday in a peaceful standoff that ended after a lengthy discussion with the climate talks president, who cradled a protester’s baby during the talks.\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian military personnel kept demonstrators from entering the site hosting  COP30 meetings in Belem , but there appeared to be no physical altercations. The protesters, most in traditional Indigenous garb, formed a human chain around the entrance to block people from entering as the day’s meetings began. Other groups of activists formed a secondary chain around them.\n \n\n   \n  “No one enters, no one leaves,” was one of the main chants of the demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  It was the second time in four days that protesters disrupted climate talks that organizers have promoted as empowering and celebrating native peoples.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the Munduruku Indigenous group led the demonstration that blocked the main entrance, demanding a meeting with Brazilian President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva .\n \n\n   \n  “President Lula, we are here in front of COP because we want you to listen to us. We refuse to be sacrificed for agribusiness,’’ protesters said in a written statement in Portuguese released by the Munduruku Ipereg Ayu Movement. “Our forest is not for sale. We are the ones who protect the climate, and the Amazon cannot continue to be destroyed to enrich large corporations.”\n \n\n   \n  Munduruku leaders had a series of demands for Brazil. They included revoking plans for commercial development of rivers, canceling a grain railway project that has raised fears of deforestation and clearer demarcations of Indigenous territories. They also want a rejection of deforestation carbon credits.\n \n\n   \n  During the 90 minutes of blockage, conference participants were rerouted and delegates entered the venue through another door. U.N. staff rushed to move metal detectors to the side entrance as hundreds of people formed long lines. The protest at the front of the venue began at around 7:30 a.m., with the main entrance blocked about 30 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  Conference president André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, met with the group as they blocked the entrance. He cradled a protester’s baby in his arms as he talked, smiling and nodding. After a prolonged discussion, do Lago and the protesters moved away from the entrance together. The entrance opened at 9:37 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change told conference participants “there is no danger” from what they called a peaceful demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  Paolo Destilo, with the environmental group Debt for Climate, joined the human chain encircling the protesters, saying he wanted to give Indigenous communities a chance to have their voices heard.\n \n\n   \n  “This is worth any delays to the conference,” he said, adding: “If this is really to be Indigenous peoples’ COP, like officials keep saying, these types of demonstrations should be welcomed at COP30.”\n \n\n   \n  “We should look at this as a message and signal from Indigenous people, who have not seen any progress over the past 33 years of COP, that all these conversations have not led to actions,” veteran anti-fossil fuel activist Harjeet Singh said. “They are the custodians of biodiversity and climate and clearly, they are not satisfied with how this process is doing.”\n \n\n   \n  “We share the frustrations that the negotiations have not delivered,” Singh said. “And the only way to address these shared frustrations is by actually addressing the climate crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  The demonstration comes after an incident Tuesday night in which Indigenous demonstrators rushed the entrance of the main venue, clashing with security and leaving two guards with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrations appeared to be ramping up heading into the weekend. Saturday at the end of the conference’s first week is traditionally the day of the biggest protests during United Nations climate talks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-election-interference-case-continues-georgia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Fani Willis’ Georgia election interference case against Trump will carry on for now with new prosecutor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal and state-level legal case against President Donald Trump and allies for alleged election interference in Georgia continues under new leadership after Fani Willis was disqualified due to her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed,” Skandalakis wrote on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Michael J. Moore, former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is skeptical the case will move ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “If the history between the Trump cases and Mr. Skandalakis foretells the future, these cases are dead on arrival,” he said. Moore also said he expects to see a recitation of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision as a basis for declining and dismissal, and is not surprised that no other prosecutor stepped forward. Moore referred to the cases as “overcharged” by using RICO.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a thankless job, akin to being invited to the center ring at the circus and then told that your job was to clean up after the elephants,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  The  historic state racketeering charges  were filed on August 14, 2023, by Willis, an elected Democrat who launched a lengthy investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in the Georgia election in early 2021. The investigation began shortly after a  January phone call  became public in which Trump pressured Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” the votes necessary for him to win the state in the Presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end. We remain confident that a fair and impartial review will lead to a dismissal of the case against President Trump,” Trump’s lead Georgia attorney Steve Sadow told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile case by the Fulton County prosecutor peaked in dramatic fashion when Trump surrendered in the Atlanta jail for a little over 20 minutes in August 2023, where he was forced to provide his mug shot for the first time. The case was seen as the most likely of the various criminal charges surrounding Trump to go to trial because it was a state case handled by a local Georgia prosecutor, rather than federal charges that could be pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was charged alongside 18 co-defendants on sweeping charges using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the state law commonly  referred to as RICO , similar to the federal version of the statute that was famously used to target criminal enterprises like the mafia.\n \n\n   \n  After a long-running investigation, Willis accused Trump and his allies of breaking several laws by participating in a conspiracy to unlawfully change the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n \n\n   \n    Several Trump allies involved in case\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the president, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was the highest-ranking official charged, along with former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who reached an agreement with two Georgia election officials this year to  settle a nearly $150 million defamation lawsuit.  \n \n\n   \n  Trump and his accused co-defendants “joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome” of the election, prosecutors alleged in the indictment, which said they “unlawfully conspired and endeavored to conduct and participate in criminal enterprise” after Trump lost the election in Georgia to Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  Sadow, Trump’s lead Georgia defense attorney on the case, vigorously maintained his client’s innocence during the ongoing legal process, along with attorneys who represented many of the co-defendants also charged in the unique racketeering conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants vehemently denied any wrongdoing, some arguing they were simply trying to rectify what they believed were serious irregularities that tainted the 2020 election results.\n \n\n   \n  Four of the 19 defendants in Willis’ case, including three attorneys directly involved in Trump’s bid to overturn the election results in the Peach State, accepted plea deals, in some cases pleading guilty to felony charges in exchange for more lenient sentencing recommendations.\n \n\n   \n  Thirty  “unindicted co-conspirators”  were also named in the high-profile case — a freight train that was barreling down the tracks simultaneously as Trump was campaigning for his second run at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Then in a  wild unexpected twist  in early 2024, Michael Roman, a campaign official for Trump in 2020, filed a motion that eventually got Willis disqualified from prosecuting the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help in the investigation. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, after Willis’ dramatic televised testimony put her personal life in the spotlight, Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee found that there was not enough evidence to firmly prove that Willis financially benefited from the relationship, and allowed Willis to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did.\n \n\n   \n  However, the legal proceedings against Trump and several co-defendants were officially paused in June 2024 when a Georgia appeals court reviewed potential misconduct by Willis.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, the appeals court officially disqualified Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Then the final dagger for Willis came in September, when  The Georgia Supreme Court declined  to hear an appeal from the Fulton County district attorney on  her removal .\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/science/mind-captioning-translate-visual-thoughts-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00-05:00","title":"Scientist turns people’s mental images into text using ‘mind-captioning’ technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Japanese scientist, Tomoyasu Horikawa, has developed a 'mind-captioning' AI technique that uses brain scans and artificial intelligence to convert mental images into descriptive text.

‘mind-captioning’ technology \n       \n  By Amarachi Orie, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:48 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A scientist in  Japan  has developed a technique that uses brain scans and artificial intelligence to turn a person’s mental images into accurate, descriptive sentences.\n \n\n   \n  While there has been progress in using scans of brain activity to  translate the words we think  into text, turning our complex mental images into language has proved challenging, according to Tomoyasu Horikawa, author of a study published November 5 in the journal  Science Advances .\n \n\n   \n  However, Horikawa’s   new method, known as “mind-captioning,” works by using AI to generate descriptive text that mirrors information in the brain about visual details such as ob﻿jects, places, actions and events, as well as the relationships between them.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa, a researcher at telecommunication company NTT’s Communication Science Laboratories just outside Tokyo, began by analyzing the brain acti﻿vity of four men and two women, native Japanese speakers between 22 and 37 years old, scanning their brains as they watched video clips. The participants viewed 2,180 videos without sound that were seconds long and varied in content among objects, scenes and actions.\n \n\n   \n  Large language models — generative AI systems trained on large datasets —   took   captions of the video clips and turned those captions into sequences of numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa trained separate, simpler AI models, known as “decoders,” to match the scanned brain activity related to the video clips to the numerical sequences.\n \n\n   \n  He then used   the decoders to interpret the study participants’ brain activity while   they watched or recalled videos that the AI had not encountered during the training process.   Another algorithm was created to progressively generate word sequences that best matched the decoded brain activity.\n \n\n   \n  As the AI learned from the data, the descriptive text tool   became better and better at using the brain scans to describe the videos the participants had watched.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just one additional step forward in the direction of what, in my view, we can legitimately call brain-reading or mind-reading,” Marcello Ienca, a professor of the ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich in Germany and president-elect of the International Neuroethics Society, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n    Potential for ‘profound’ health interventions\n \n\n   \n  The AI model generated text in English, even though the participants were not native English speakers.\n \n\n   \n  The method can create comprehensive descriptions of visual content, even without using the activity in language-related regions of the brain, or the “language network,” Horikawa said, “indicating that this method can be used even when someone has damage around that language network.”\n \n\n   \n  The technology could potentially be used to assist people with aphasia, who struggle with language expression due to damage around the language network; or  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects speech, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study paves the way for some profound interventions for people who have difficulty communicating, including non-verbal autistic people,” said psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, a lecturer at Barnard College in New York who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  However, “we have to use it carefully and make sure we aren’t being invasive and that everyone consents to it,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The ultimate privacy challenge’\n \n\n   \n  The success of this method — which could be applied to decode the thoughts of infants or animals, or the content of dreams — “raises ethical concerns” regarding privacy, with the possibility of disclosing an individual’s private thoughts before they have verbalized them, the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  If in the future this technology is used by consumers beyond biomedical purposes, “I think this is the ultimate privacy challenge,” Ienca said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that there are many companies, such as  Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant startup , that are making public claims about soon developing neural implants for the general population.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get there, then we need to have very, very strict rules when it comes to granting access to people’s minds and brains,” Ienca said, highlighting that our brains include “sensitive information” such as “signatures of early dementia and psychiatric disorders and depression.”\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the journal  Cell  in August suggested that the “leakage” of private inner thoughts during decoding could be prevented by a mechanism in which the user thinks of a particular keyword to unlock the decoding tool only when intended.\n \n\n   \n  The “neuroscience is moving fast and the assistive potential is huge — but mental privacy and freedom of thought protections can’t wait,” said social scientist Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, an assistant professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and a director of European Affairs at the Neurorights Foundation in New York.\n \n\n   \n  “We should treat neural data as sensitive by default, require explicit purpose-limited consent, and prioritize on-device processing with user-controlled ‘unlock’ mechanisms. Reliance on AI introduces additional regulatory and cybersecurity challenges and underscores the need for complementary, AI-specific legal framework,” Szoszkiewicz, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, Horikawa noted that the method used in his study requires a large amount of data collection, with the cooperation of active participants. So, while the technology is useful for neuroscientific research, it is “not so accurate for practical use,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the videos used in the study included typical scenes of, for example, a dog biting a man, but not more unusual scenes — say, a man biting a dog. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the technique could be used to capture less predictable mental images.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, “while some people may worry that this technology poses serious risk to mental privacy,” in reality, “the current approach cannot easily read a person’s private thoughts,” Horikawa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-05:00","title":"Why markets are suddenly on edge","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Markets are experiencing significant volatility in November 2025 due to a combination of overvalued tech stocks, especially in AI-related sectors, and uncertainty stemming from the government shutdown delaying key economic data.

 \nUpdated: \n        12:16 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For months, it felt like nothing could knock stocks off their steady ascent — but November has been a rough month on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 3% this month and on track for its first losing month since March. The Nasdaq has shed almost $2 trillion in market value in two weeks as investors have dumped tech stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks opened sharply lower Friday but bounced off their lows as investors bought the dip: The Nasdaq turned positive and rose 0.6% after briefly falling more than 1.8%. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow was down 190 points, or 0.4%.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks were set for another horrific session at the open following yesterday’s debacle but investors saw the sharp dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  The benchmark S&P 500 is down 1.2% this month while the Dow is down 0.6%. The S&P 500 has shed more than $1.3 trillion   in market value in just over two weeks as it has retreated from a record high set in late October.\n \n\n   \n  After months of gains, investors have outsized expectations, making them easer to disappoint. Tech stocks have become  relatively pricey .\n \n\n   \n  And after the government shutdown halted official data releases for weeks, investors are unsure what the new figures, as government releases resume, will show about the state of the world’s biggest economy. That, in turn, is stoking uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in December, and adding to the Wall Street jitters.\n \n\n   \n  “When the government was shut down, we could believe whatever we wanted to believe,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN’s Matt Egan. “Now we need to be data dependent, and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n  Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence carried the market to new record highs this year. But now some investors are hitting pause, taking profits and reassessing whether those stocks will continue to produce superior returns.\n \n\n   \n  “With lofty valuations in AI-related stocks, it’s understandable that investors are on edge about anything that might go wrong,” Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin, which can serve as a gauge of how risk-on investors are feeling, slid 5% on Friday and hovered around $95,000. The cryptocurrency has tumbled almost 25% since it hit a record high in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Data deluge incoming\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street and the Fed are awaiting a deluge of economic data that was delayed due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That is contributing to mounting nerves about the Fed’s next move. Traders on Friday were pricing a 50% chance the central bank will cut rates in December, down from a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the last policy meeting, in October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cast some doubt on whether the Fed would cut rates again this year. Fed officials — including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who is a voter on policy moves this year — delivered remarks this week that have shown hesitancy to continue cutting rates.\n \n\n   \n  While Evercore ISI analysts in a note said they still see an interest rate cut next month, they think it’s “very hard to call” because of a combination of factors, including “data blindness.”\n \n\n   \n  The central bank’s rate cuts in September and October boosted stocks, and a pause on rate cuts could pose troubles for stocks that have rallied on expectations for lower borrowing costs — in particular, the AI and tech stocks that have propelled the market higher.\n \n\n   \n  “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday, according to  CNN’s Fear and Greed index .\n \n\n   \n  But some investors say a pullback in stocks can also be healthy.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq gained every month from April through the end of October. Now, the market is resetting as investors reassess the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “This (pullback) is somewhat overdue, and I don’t think it’s the start of a  correction ,” Yardeni said.\n \n\n   \n    AI jitters\n \n\n   \n  There is also increasing skepticism about whether Big Tech companies can make enough money to justify the enormous spending taking place on AI deals now.\n \n\n   \n  “The technology sector has faced selling pressure in recent weeks amid concerns over rising debt issuance and a surge in capital expenditures” like new data centers, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, told CNN’s Matt Egan in an email. “Investors are questioning whether these investments will translate into future profitability.”\n \n\n   \n  Oracle shares ( ORCL ) surged 36% in one day on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Shares in Oracle have tumbled since then, erasing those gains.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies announcing large supply deals with OpenAI have similarly been met with skepticism around OpenAI’s ability to deliver on its financial objectives,” John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Oracle facing pressure. Meta shares ( META ) are down 23% since hitting a record high in mid-August. Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) are down 11% since hitting a record high in late October. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) are down 16% since hitting a record high on November 3.\n \n\n   \n  To Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, this month has been defined by investors rotating out of tech stocks and into other sectors.\n \n\n   \n  The recent pullback, he said, feels like “investors trying to protect profits after a really healthy run off the lows in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/china/shenzhou-20-crew-return-earth-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Chinese astronauts arrive home after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou-20 mission returned to Earth more than a week late after a suspected debris strike caused a crack in their return capsule’s window, delaying their journey home.

Earth \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday more than a week later than their scheduled arrival, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris strike left their spaceship with a cracked window.\n \n\n   \n  The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China’s Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they’d even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.\n \n\n   \n  But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).\n \n\n   \n  Medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  “The path of humanity’s exploration of space is not smooth,” Chen Dong, one of the astronauts, told journalists in front of the capsule. “It is full of difficulties and challenges, and that is also why we choose to walk this path.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very proud that we successfully completed the mission…We have finally made it home safely.”\n \n\n   \n  The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China’s Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.\n \n\n   \n  Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a  nine-hour sortie , and it’s about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.\n \n\n   \n  The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.\n \n\n   \n  The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed  bans on Chinese citizens  with US visas participating in NASA programs.\n \n\n   \n  The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts who have been left in limbo. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, for example, spent 371 days on the ISS — a US record — after a tiny piece of space debris struck his Russian Soyuz spacecraft and forced a monthslong extension to his trip. Roscosmos launched a replacement capsule that eventually carried Rubio and cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams saw their weeklong stay on the International Space Station stretch into a more than nine-month mission after their spacecraft malfunctioned during a test flight. They joined the ISS expedition crew   and eventually  returned home  in March.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/style/katseye-creative-director-humberto-leon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00+00:00","title":"Katseye: The Blueprint for a Modern, Multicultural Girl Group","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Katseye, a multiracial girl group formed from the Netflix show 'Pop Star Academy,' is a groundbreaking fusion of K-pop structure and global cultural diversity.

modern girl group. Humberto Leon is the mastermind behind their image \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:28 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two years ago, six young women — Sophia, Lara, Manon, Daniela, Megan and Yoonchae — went from relative obscurity to internet fame when the Netflix reality show, “Pop Star Academy,” turned them into the now-Grammy-nominated girl group Katseye.\n \n\n   \n  As their names were called out in the finale, the newly appointed members — who beat 120,000 other contestants vying for a spot — hugged and congratulated each other through sobs, each in matching gray blazer-skirt suits, styled with white shirts, knee-high socks and black shoes — mimicking the kind of attire worn by South Korean secondary students.\n \n\n   \n  The group is backed by Hybe Corporation, which brought K-pop to a global audience through mega artists like BTS, and Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record company and owner of Geffen Records. Together they sought to create the world’s first mainstream multiracial girl group modeled on  the traditional K-pop framework , which includes catchy melodies, synchronized dance moves and a strong emphasis on aesthetic appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Katseye’s members have   since stepped out in many head-turning looks, from the revealing red leather stage outfits worn in August for their Lollapalooza music festival performance, which drew record-breaking crowds, to the glitzy Dolce & Gabbana dresses worn for  their MTV VMAs red carpet debut  a month later. Earlier in the summer, they fronted  a viral campaign for Gap  while dancing   in low-rise denim to the 2003 Kelis song “Milkshake.” On other occasions, they’ve dipped into luxury brand archives and worn pieces from the likes of Prada, Hussein Chalayan and early 2000s Balenciaga designed by Nicolas Ghesquière. And as they embark on their first solo tour across North America — the tickets for which sold out in minutes — more eye-catching ensembles are sure to feature.\n \n\n   \n  The creative mastermind behind the band’s image is Humberto Leon, a former fashion entrepreneur and designer. Today, as Katseye’s creative director, Leon styles the members from head to toe, weighing in on every detail from the accessories to hair and makeup. In short, anything to do with their visual image falls under Leon’s purview.\n \n\n   \n  “There was this kind of feeling of tomboy meets rebellion,” Leon told CNN over a video call from Los Angeles, as he reflected on Katseye’s first appearance as a group. “The uniforms added a fun storytelling aspect.”\n \n\n   \n  School uniforms are a popular and recurring trope in pop culture (see a 16-year-old  Britney Spears in schoolgirl attire  in the music video for “Baby One More Time”). Several K-pop girl groups, including Girls’ Generation, Red Velvet and 2NE1, have also previously worn them, as they convey a youthful and fresh image. But Katseye’s look had subtle touches that pushed the common visual motif forward, according to Leon, whose subversive approach to fashion over a decades-long career has often appealed to hip audiences. “We wanted to differentiate,” he explained, “so all the jackets were actually boys’ blazers.”\n \n\n   \n    Bringing cultures together\n \n\n   \n  K-pop has gained significant mainstream traction over the years, but Katseye (which was trained using the K-pop methodology) is unlike many of the genre’s other bands. The group comprises multiple ethnicities: Sophia is from the Philippines; Yoonchae was born in South Korea; Manon was raised in Switzerland to Swiss-Italian and Ghanian parents; Daniela is Venezuelan-Cuban and Lara is of Indian descent, though both were born and raised in the US; and Megan is from Hawaii, born to a Singaporean-Chinese mother and Swedish-American father. Their songs are also sung almost entirely in English.\n \n\n   \n  Since Katseye’s official debut in 2024 with the EP “SIS (Soft is Strong)” and the viral breakthrough single “Touch,” which quickly landed on Spotify’s Top Hits playlist, the group has grown into one of pop’s most watched newcomers, adored for its diverse appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Leon shares a similarly multicultural upbringing. He currently resides in Eagle Rock, the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood where he was born and raised by a Peruvian father and Chinese mother, to whom he attributes his love of fashion. “My mom worked in a cafeteria by day, but in the evening, she would work on all these fun things, like selling cowboy hats to people, or in the ’80s she would sell fur coats at home, almost like the way people sell Tupperware,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She always encouraged me to be yourself and to clash, to not need things to be so perfect,” Leon added. “I took to heart a lot of that.”\n \n\n   \n  After working as a visual merchandiser for Gap and Burberry early in his career, Leon made his name in New York in the 2000s — he co-founded the now-shuttered Opening Ceremony (a once-cult shopping destination with stores in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo) and was formerly co-designer at Kenzo, a role he jointly held with Carol Lim, with whom he revitalized the label by injecting a youthful, streetwise sensibility that appealed to shoppers.\n \n\n   \n  “Opening Ceremony was the antithesis of everything I had ever done,” said Leon. “It was about celebrating young designers and going around the world and finding these gems and bringing them to one place and creating almost this town square where people can discover stuff. Some people would buy, some didn’t — but for us, it didn’t matter. It was about creating a community where people can come together.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon is among a wave of fashion insiders who in recent years have made the shift to music and entertainment. Cynthia Oh, for instance, worked in high-end retail for more than two decades before becoming the visual creative director at Hybe and, now, The Black Label — K-pop super-producer Teddy Park’s company, which represents Blackpink’s Rosé among others.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve always celebrated this idea of bringing culture together,” Leon continued. “And so, in many ways, Katseye is just a different version of that.”\n \n\n   \n    A new kind of girl power\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s return to Eagle Rock and subsequent decision to launch the Peruvian-Chinese restaurant Chifa, in 2022, was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. But it also led to his music industry crossover. “One day, this great punk rock girl group called  The Linda Lindas  came in. I was really inspired by them and said, ‘I would love to make a music video for you. Let’s do something fun.’” So, Leon worked with the band to create music videos for its 2022 album, “Growing Up,” which subsequently caught the eye of Hybe chairman Bang Si-hyuk and Interscope Geffen A&M chairman and CEO John Janick.\n \n\n   \n  “They approached me and asked if I would be interested in working on a global girl group,” said Leon. “The one thing I realized in all my other ventures I had done before is that there was this connection to storytelling and authenticity. When I was able to sum this up for myself, I felt like I could bring that same energy to other things,” he said. “The restaurant was the first thing that I started outside of fashion — yet a lot of people tell me it has a similar vibe to Opening Ceremony. It made me realize I was doing the right thing, and that I could bring this feeling to other cultures and artistic work.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s first interactions with Katseye involved “really getting to know them.” There have been “countless” girl groups, he said, rattling off a list of acts preceding them, such as the Spice Girls and Destiny’s Child, so it was crucial to figure out “the ideologies and virtues that these girls bring” and what made them   different. “The first thing I said to them was, ‘I want to hear about your background, how you grew up. I know you can dance, you can sing, but let’s hear about what you truly love and are inspired by,’ and with that, we were able to create a story that was genuine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We talk a lot about silhouettes, we talk about designers, but it goes beyond that. We make sure that their culture is around and that each girl, as a whole, is represented,” Leon continued, noting the bindi worn by Lara as an example. (The bindi — a decorative mark or sticker worn on the forehead, most commonly by women in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions — is often sported by Lara, who has not disclosed her religion but has spoken publicly about using it to reclaim and represent   the   South Asian identity she was teased for as a child.)\n \n\n   \n  That emphasis on representation also extends to Katseye’s music. The band’s latest EP, “Beautiful Chaos,” released in June, marks a bolder chapter, with tracks like “Gnarly” and “M.I.A” highlighting each member’s vocal range and increasingly defined personal identities. “Gabriela,” the second single in the EP, is “very different to most of the other songs in that it has a femininity to it,” explained Leon. “Daniela sings the Spanish part of the song. It has this Latin vibe that we wanted to make sure that we capture.” What remains crucial, across both their songs and style, is “that there is synergy amongst each other,” Leon said.\n \n\n   \n  As Katseye’s tour begins, just weeks after the band’s first Grammy nomination, Leon is remaining tightlipped about his stage outfits. “We like to keep things as a surprise,” he teased, but noted that maintaining a sense of relatability and individuality have remained top priorities.\n \n\n   \n  For Leon, Katseye is the living embodiment of girl power for a Gen Z audience that is   “hungry for authenticity and genuine brands that stand for something, or a voice that they can relate to,” he said. But the group, Leon hopes, isn’t just for young girls, but fans of all genders and ages. “I want people to see themselves in Katseye,” he said. “I want them to be excited that a group like Katseye exists.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/ukraine-russia-assassination-attempt-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:37:00-05:00","title":"Ukraine attacks key Russian oil hub as deadly strikes pound Kyiv","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine launched a major strike on Novorossiysk, a critical Russian oil export hub, using long-range Neptune missiles and UAVs, causing infrastructure damage and a major fire.

Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had launched the domestically produced long-range Neptune cruise missiles at Russian targets, without specifying where.\n \n\n   \n  “This is our entirely justified response to the ongoing Russian terror,” Zelensky said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said this week that Ukraine was “increasing the effectiveness” of the use of domestic long-range weapons, including Neptune and Flamingo missiles, as well as jet drones.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, a source within the Security Service of Ukraine said forces struck the “second-largest oil export center in Russia,” damaging oil tankers, pipeline infrastructure and pumping stations.\n \n\n   \n  The operation ignited a “major” fire at the facility, which remained burning on Friday morning, according to the source, who added that anti-aircraft missile systems were also hit.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratiev, confirmed the attack on the oil depot in Novorossiysk, claiming that fragments of downed Ukrainian drones had hit the oil depot.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kondratiev, at least four people were wounded as a result of Ukraine’s attack on the port city, adding that at least four apartment buildings and two private homes had been damaged. A state of emergency has been declared there, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Russia’s defense ministry said it had intercepted a total of 216 Ukrainian drones overnight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv experienced another heavy night of Russian aerial attacks. The Russian strikes on Ukraine’s capital killed at least six people and injured dozens more, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  A married couple, aged 71 and 73, were among those killed, Kyiv police said.\n \n\n   \n  Two more people were killed in a Russian attack on the Black Sea city of Chornomorsk on Friday morning, according to the head of the Odesa regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n    Foiled assassination plot\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russia’s security service has claimed it foiled a plot by Ukraine to assassinate a high-ranking Kremlin official inside Russia as the alleged target visited a graveyard.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian special services were planning to target the unnamed man, described as “one of the highest-ranking officials of the Russian state,” while he was visiting the graves of his relatives at a cemetery outside Moscow, according to a Friday statement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n \n\n   \n  The FSB also claimed in its statement that Ukraine is planning similar attacks inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  CNN could not independently verify Russia’s claims. The Security Service of Ukraine denied the report, telling CNN, “They are churning out fake news and statements non-stop. Our position is not to comment on their nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n  Assassinations have become a hallmark of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Targeted killings inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine have surged since 2022,  according to  monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED).\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has also seen assassinations. In July, a Ukrainian security services officer was  gunned down in broad daylight  in Kyiv, with authorities blaming Russia’s security services for the killing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillon-retire","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:53:00-05:00","title":"Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is stepping down","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug McMillon, who served as CEO of Walmart for over a decade, is retiring and will step down in early 2026, with John Furner, the current CEO of Walmart’s US operations, set to take over on February 1, 2026.

McMillon is stepping down \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO for just over a decade, is retiring next year, the retailer announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon will be succeeded by John Furner on February 1, 2026. Furner is currently the CEO and president of Walmart’s US operations, the company’s largest business unit. Both executives have been with the company for several decades in various leadership roles.\n \n\n   \n  The transition comes amid a tumultuous time for retailers, as  tariffs  and sinking consumer sentiment has roiled the industry’s bottom lines. Yet  Walmart  under McMillon has overcome many of the issues that have plagued competitors – its supply-chain dominance and grocery prowess has allowed Walmart to offer rock-bottom prices on necessities, attracting customers across a wide range of income groups. The company reported in its most recent earnings call that its fastest-growing customer segment includes households who earn  more than $100,000 a year .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also oversaw the company’s transition to a major ecommerce competitor, offering a strong alternative to Amazon and a significant growth engine for Walmart. The company has grown its Walmart+ subscription business that serves as a kind of nascent rival to Amazon Prime.\n \n\n   \n  He was also previously the  chairman  of Business Roundtable, the most prominent group of nearly 200 chief executives representing corporate America’s interests in Washington, for a two-year term.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to expanding Walmart, he’s also made striking changes at the company. In 2019, Walmart stopped selling handgun ammunition, ammunition commonly used in military-style assault weapons and ask customers to stop openly carrying guns at stores after a mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas location left  22 people dead .\n \n\n   \n  He was also an  outspoken  critic of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, and he has frequently spoken out against President Donald Trump’s  tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  But McMillon also oversaw the unsuccessful $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an upmarket Amazon rival that didn’t pan out the way Walmart had expected. The business was ultimately shut down and integrated into the broader Walmart.com. McMillon’s push into upscale clothing, like Bonobos, also  hasn’t worked out .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon first began as a store associate and worked his way to top including stints at Sam’s Club and Walmart’s international operations. He helped harness Walmart ( WMT ) into being a true competitor to Amazon and its stock has grown 300% since he became CEO in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family and Board have stated many times that Doug was uniquely qualified to be CEO at the necessary time for Walmart,” said Greg Penner, Chairman of Walmart Inc., in a press release. “Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Furner, he’s been the CEO and President of Walmart US’ 4,600 stores since 2019 and also began as an hourly associate in 1993. In addition, he’s worked at Sam’s Club and Walmart China. The company credited his “associate development, digital innovation, and operational excellence.”\n \n\n   \n  Walmart said that McMillon remain on its board until next June and will be an adviser to Furner throughout fiscal year 2027. An announcement on Walmart’s US CEO replacement will be named soon.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/king-charles-iii-77th-birthday-photo-intl-scli-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"New photo released to mark King Charles III’s 77th birthday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III’s 77th birthday was celebrated with a newly released photo taken at Sandringham Estate, showing him tending to gardens, and with public events including a reception at Cyfarthfa Castle, opening of a South Wales Metro Train Depot, and gun salutes in London.

briefed this week on options for military operations in Venezuela \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Zachary Cohen, Jim Sciutto, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was briefed this week on options for military operations inside Venezuela as he continues to mull a path forward in the country, four sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to decide on how to proceed, and he continues to weigh the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign. The president has previously voiced reservations about taking military action meant to oust Nicolas Maduro, concerned about whether it would prove effective.\n \n\n   \n  While Wednesday’s briefing included an updated set of options for the president to consider, it did not indicate that he’s closer to making a decision, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the briefing said the options were similar to those that have been discussed within the Pentagon, and some publicly reported, in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The target options – which United States Southern Command has stood up planning cells to develop – are part of an operation dubbed “SOUTHERN SPEAR,” according to a senior US official aware of the planning. They were presented by top officials on Trump’s national security team, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the operation on X Thursday night, though he did not reveal details.\n \n\n   \n  “Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Command had  previously announced  an operation called Operation Southern Spear in January. An announcement at the time said it would utilize “long-dwell robotic surface vessels, small robotic interceptor boats, and vertical take-off and landing robotic air vessels” to help with counternarcotics operations.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Southern Spear. The White House did not comment on the briefing. CBS News was first to report on the briefing.\n \n\n   \n   The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” arrived in the Caribbean this week amid a massive scale-up of US military resources.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including  air strikes  on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro.

rejects defamation claim \n       \n  By Catherine Nicholls, Christian Edwards, Billy Stockwell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:53 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC apologized to US President Donald Trump on Thursday over a documentary that Trump’s lawyers described as false and defamatory, seeking to defuse a row that has plunged the public broadcaster into its  worst crisis in years .\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson said that lawyers for the broadcaster had written to Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President (Donald) Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any BBC platforms while rejecting that it was defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s arguments as to why it believes it does not have a case to answer, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip not meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the October 2024 documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday. He is yet to respond to the BBC apology.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC had already apologized for an error of judgment in the documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, but not before it had ignited a scandal that saw the resignations of its director-general and head of news.\n \n\n   \n  In the documentary, Trump’s January 6 speech was edited to show him saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the US leader said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” with “fight like hell” coming 54 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Trump said the British broadcaster had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday,  the Telegraph newspaper  accused the BBC of similarly editing the same speech in a 2022 episode of the show Newsnight, again making it look like Trump was encouraging his followers to “fight like hell” in the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the broadcaster said that “the BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards,” adding that the matter “has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s board has been criticized for responding too slowly to the editing error, which was revealed in a leaked internal memo that has created a firestorm of criticism and allegations of systemic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Deborah Turness, the outgoing CEO of BBC News who resigned on Sunday, has said that while mistakes were made, “allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to BBC News staff following her resignation, Turness said that the backlash surrounding the Trump documentary had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC that the broadcaster was “right to apologize for what were serious mistakes.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked if she believed the BBC is “doomed” if it loses the public’s trust, the official said that the organization “is and remains the most trusted source of news in this country, and one of the top five most trusted sources of news all over the world.”\n \n\n   \n  When it makes mistakes, the BBC must be “willing and able to respond to that level of challenge and to put in place changes, because that trust is something that is essential, it’s vital, it’s precious, and it must be protected,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The British public broadcaster’s next steps are not immediately clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment when reached by CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/science/hitler-dna-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Researchers say they verified and sequenced Hitler’s DNA.

What they discovered is a controversial bombshell \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:52 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Researchers have analyzed a sample of DNA believed to belong to Adolf Hitler, which they say reveals the dictator of Nazi Germany had a genetic marker for a rare disorder that can delay puberty, according to a new documentary.\n \n\n   \n  The research, which took more than four years to complete, was led by geneticist Turi King, a professor at the UK’s University of Bath who is known for identifying the  remains of King Richard III . King said she verified that a piece of material taken from a couch in the bunker where Hitler shot himself in 1945 was soaked in the dictator’s blood by comparing a DNA sample recovered from the blood with a confirmed relative of Hitler’s.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to suggesting the possibility that Hitler had a hormone-disrupting congenital condition called  Kallmann syndrome , the documentary examined rumors that the dictator had Jewish ancestry and looked at whether he had a genetic predisposition to certain mental health conditions. Called “Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,” the documentary premieres Saturday on Channel 4 in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  However, the findings shared in the documentary haven’t been reviewed by other scientists in the field or published in a scientific journal, making it hard for experts not involved in the project to evaluate the validity of its assertions. King said that the analysis had been submitted to a “high-profile” journal and said she hopes the work will be published soon.\n \n\n   \n  The small patch of frayed fabric started its journey in 1945 in the hands of US Army Col. Roswell P. Rosengren, who was communications officer for Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower. When Rosengren was allowed into Hitler’s bunker by Soviet forces, he cut a swatch of material from a bloodstained couch, according to the documentary. The swatch stayed in Rosengren’s family before being put up for sale at auction in 2014 and purchased by the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t know what we were going to find,” King said. “It could have been the most boring genome on the planet, but it has been incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The most striking finding from the team’s analysis was that Hitler had a mutation on a gene called PROK2. Variants in this gene  are a cause of Kallmann syndrome  and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, King  said. In boys, these conditions   can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, they are characterized by low testosterone levels. You either don’t go through puberty or you go through a partial puberty … 5% of cases get associated with a  micropenis , ”    King said, referring to a small but normally structured penis.\n \n\n   \n    Clues in the historical record\n \n\n   \n  At the time of his death, Hitler was observed at the end of the sofa with a gun and blood splattered on the couch and the wall behind him, said Nicholas F. Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. He examined parts of the sofa, which is now in Russia, in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  “If the provenance of the sofa material used is confirmed to have come from the Bunker and from the settee that Hitler and  Eva Braun  died on, then the likelihood of the blood having come from Hitler is very good,” Bellantoni said by email.\n \n\n   \n  The new details that King put forth appear to align with the historical record, according to Alex Kay, an expert on Nazi Germany and senior lecturer at the Chair of War Studies at Germany’s University of Potsdam. Kay also appeared in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that a medical document from Hitler’s stay in prison after a failed coup known as the Munich  beer hall putsch  in 1923 suggested the dictator had right-side cryptorchidism — a condition in which a testicle fails to descend into the scrotum.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of Kallmann syndrome is, for me, personally, as a historian and as somebody who has spent more than 20 years researching the Nazis, a major finding,” Kay said. He added the information potentially explained Hitler’s lack of personal relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Kay and King said the findings also put to rest lingering rumors that Hitler had Jewish ancestry — speculation that stemmed from Hitler’s grandmother becoming pregnant while working in a Jewish household, according to the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Because the Y chromosome data analyzed in the research matched the DNA of Hitler’s male line relative, King said it’s not possible Hitler had Jewish ancestry. “If that was the case, we wouldn’t have got the DNA match with him,” King said. “That DNA match not only confirmed that this is Hitler’s DNA but also confirms that that story of human Jewish ancestry through his father is just simply not true.”\n \n\n   \n    The value of historical DNA\n \n\n   \n  King said she had some initial reservations about taking part in the documentary but decided to participate because she felt her expertise would   ensure that the analysis was scientifically rigorous. “This is also not just a documentary but an academic paper,” she said, adding she had no publication date to offer.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have previously used DNA to study well-known historical figures. Beethoven’s DNA, recovered from a lock of hair, revealed that the  composer had health issues . Archaeologists also widely use ancient DNA from human remains.\n \n\n   \n  However, without information on the quality of the genome, the raw data or how the analyses were done, it is not possible to assess the assertions made in the documentary, according to Pontus Skoglund, senior group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n \n\n   \n  “Stepping back, the scientific value of a media campaign such as this balanced against the possible stigmatization of individuals with these real diseases today can also be questioned,” Skoglund said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the researchers could have shared the findings with the scientific community on what’s known as a preprint server before a formal peer review and publication in an established journal.\n \n\n   \n  It’s plausible that historical DNA could be extracted from the piece of cloth, but there has to be good justification for studying the DNA from historical figures and a defined set of questions, said Tom Booth, Skoglund’s colleague and a bioarchaeologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “There are extensive historical records documenting the behaviour of Hitler in public and private,” Booth said via email. “(H)e is probably one of the most intensively studied figures in history, so I think it’s difficult to argue the DNA evidence adds much in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  “Even the Kallmann syndrome diagnosis might not be as straightforward as the headlines suggest. There can be a lot of variation in how it manifests physically, and while it is a plausible explanation for his undescended testicle, it doesn’t justify the amount of ‘micropenis’ in my newsfeed.” \n \n\n   \n    A ‘small, small puzzle piece’\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also said they calculated a polygenic risk score, which involves sifting through a person’s DNA to quantify disease risk. Their findings suggested that Hitler had an increased genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.\n \n\n   \n  However, polygenic risk score is a tool used today for research purposes — it’s not diagnostic and doesn’t mean that Hitler necessarily had these conditions, said Ditte Demontis, a professor in psychiatric genetics at Denmark’s Aarhus University, who was involved in the research and appears in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  “Currently, we are at a state where polygenic risk scores for psychiatric conditions are only used in the context of research,” Demontis emphasized. “We can say something at a group level but not an individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Demontis compared Hitler’s polygenic risk score with those of 30,000 Danish people and found that if Hitler lived today “his score for schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder was actually higher than 99% of the individuals in the Danish population.” It is also rare to have a high polygenic risk score for all three conditions, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not diagnostic, and I also want to stress that the score absolutely by no means leads to any certain kinds of behavior or actions,” Demontis said.\n \n\n   \n  King agreed. “We are at great, great pain not to stigmatize people with these conditions, because, you know … it’s incredibly rare that   people with these conditions go on to commit violent acts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And the other thing is that Hitler did not act alone, he had hundreds and thousands of people who helped him,” King noted. “They’re not all going to have the same genetic makeup as him. His genetics is just a small, small puzzle piece.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/republicans-scramble-health-care-obamacare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Republicans scramble for health care plan, as Democrats eye midterm battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire in just weeks, Republicans are scrambling to develop a health care plan to prevent soaring premiums and avoid political backlash.

And it’s causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the White House, officials are accelerating efforts to put together a new health care plan that fulfills  President Donald Trump ’s desire to take another shot at overhauling Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  Those early discussions have sought to balance Trump’s demands against the broader Republican Party’s wariness of waging another politically disastrous health care war, four people familiar with the matter said. Officials are debating a limited package of conservative health care changes, including eliminating the enhanced ACA subsidies in favor of funneling money directly to Americans — potentially through an expansion of health savings accounts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, are closely watching the GOP’s plans, which they believe will never pass Congress – giving them a huge political boost and possibly delivering them control of the House in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of the GOP’s plans is fueling anxiety for Republicans like Rep. Jeff Van Drew, the outspoken populist from New Jersey who has repeatedly urged party leaders to give some relief for those Obamacare premiums or face voters’ wrath next November.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a whole bunch [of ideas] that are out there,” Van Drew said, ticking off proposals such as Trump’s idea to give money directly to consumers to buy plans. “The question is, can we get them done on time, to really not hurt people in the United States of America?”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another reason Van Drew is worrying. Time is running short and he said GOP leaders have been tight-lipped on their plans: “A lot of members haven’t seen any of this.”\n \n\n   \n  He isn’t the only one sounding the alarm. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — who has drawn the ire of Trump himself for her criticism of the party — has been repeatedly warning of a health care catastrophe of the GOP’s own making if Congress doesn’t act.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s my problem. Republicans have never fixed it,” Greene said of Obamacare in an interview with “The Sean Spicer Show.” She said Republicans need to act to make sure “the American people aren’t driving 80 miles per hour off a brick wall and hitting a financial crisis which is what’s actually happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the GOP’s leadership ranks,  there’s an acknowledgement  they need to do something on health care affordability. But those party leaders are also staunchly opposed to renewing those subsidies, which they insist simply funds insurance companies and props up a failed law.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, House GOP leaders are assembling their own slate of health care bills — though exactly which ones have yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pulling together the best ideas that we can, in the quickest fashion, to bring premiums down,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Wednesday night, the same day the House returned from a six-week recess during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House aides have similarly indicated that they will soon have a concrete plan, insisting that the administration plans to play a central role in directing the GOP’s health care strategy amid deepening concerns over Trump’s standing on the economy and affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to further expanding health savings accounts, officials have weighed a range of existing conservative policy ideas aimed at expanding patients’ health care options and lowering costs — including loosening certain Obamacare guardrails and giving states greater flexibility to customize their health insurance marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Yet many of those proposals have proven unpopular with voters in the past, and fall well short of Trump’s vow to “forget this Obamacare madness” altogether. And as the midterm outlook worsens for the GOP, some in the party still plan to push for a simpler compromise on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  There are at least a dozen House Republicans who do support temporarily extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies, many of them from battleground districts that will be key to GOP control of the chamber next year. Virginia Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans has been particularly vocal on the issue, drafting a bill to extend the subsidies for one year that’s gotten a dozen GOP cosponsors.\n \n\n   \n  Kiggans and her cosponsors are already working to plot a path forward: Staff of several of those members on the bill will meet Thursday to discuss next steps, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Another swing-seat Republican backing the bill, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday seeking bipartisan talks to work on a bill extending those Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But even some House moderates privately acknowledge that it’s unlikely any provision that upholds Obamacare can pass the GOP chamber. Even if the bill would win Democratic votes, GOP leaders know there is fierce resistance to any Obamacare bill and would refuse to put it on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also grown increasingly opposed to continuing the subsidies despite the political peril, with one of the people familiar with the matter characterizing the president as “on fire” over the issue. Though administration officials during the shutdown’s first weeks had weighed supporting a short-term extension that would phase out the subsidies over time, that idea has since appeared to lose steam, the people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent days has instead repeatedly disparaged the tax credits as a “disaster” and latched onto arguments made by conservative allies that they largely amount to a windfall for insurance companies.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jim Jordan, the influential House Judiciary chairman, for instance, entirely dismissed the idea of extending the subsidies when pressed by CNN if he could accept any plan that kept them in place.\n \n\n   \n  “If Obamacare was so wonderful, why do we need to keep extending the expanded subsidies?” the Ohio Republican said. ”This is an expansion of Obamacare.”\n \n\n   \n  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, too, argued that any extension of the subsidies would be simply a move to “prop up a failed Obamacare fund.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Affordable Care Act has failed miserably at being affordable. That is a broken model. We want to give people options that lower their premiums, not just shovel more money to insurance companies,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/cost-of-living-affordability-plan-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00-05:00","title":"The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urgently revising his economic plan in response to a growing affordability crisis, declining public support, and political setbacks, including a Democratic sweep of recent elections.

The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:51 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump swept into office with a bold plan to  remake America’s economy . But the realities of a persistent  affordability crisis , low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.\n \n\n   \n  Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.\n \n\n   \n  Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan A\n \n\n   \n  The original Trump economic plan was based on  three bold assumptions :\n \n\n   \n  For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.\n \n\n   \n  As it turns out, some parts didn’t work.\n \n\n   \n  Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans has  doubled over the past four years , according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recent  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan B\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new plan is emerging.\n \n\n   \n   Tariff dividends:  Trump last weekend floated the idea of  $2,000 tariff rebate checks , a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.\n \n\n   \n  Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,  exacerbating inflation .\n \n\n   \n   50-year mortgages:  Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a  50-year mortgage , which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowers  never actually own their homes . Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.\n \n\n   \n  All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security.\n \n\n   \n   Portable mortgages:  Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering a  portable mortgage , which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high.\n \n\n   \n  But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.\n \n\n   \n   Lowering some tariffs:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announce  lower tariffs on produce  that isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.\n \n\n   \n    Make America Affordable Again\n \n\n   \n  A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-called  K-shaped economy , in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasingly  live paycheck to paycheck. \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: He  claimed, falsely , that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treene  that Trump is getting more frequent economic briefings  and has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.\n \n\n   \n  And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-decision-nears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Clock is ticking ahead of NCAA’s decision on proposed gambling rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As sports gambling becomes more legal and accessible, the NCAA faces increasing pressure to update its rules regarding college athletes' ability to bet on professional sports.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.\n \n\n   \n  But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.\n \n\n   \n  Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.\n \n\n   \n  “This change recognizes the realities of today’s sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,’’ Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.\n \n\n   \n  The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.\n \n\n   \n  The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association’s commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,’’ Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.\n \n\n   \n  It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner’s protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC’s assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee’s report.\n \n\n   \n  Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.\n \n\n   \n  In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General’s office  announced  14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/immigration-california-revokes-commercial-drivers-licenses-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:33:00-05:00","title":"California revokes 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses for immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California has announced the revocation of 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that drivers’ legal status expired before their licenses did.

Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the  drivers were legally allowed  to be in the US, state officials said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public’s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the US made an illegal U-turn and caused a  crash in Florid a that killed three people.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California’s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver’s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we’ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,” Duffy said, referring to the state’s governor. “This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person’s legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Newsom’s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver’s licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed.\n \n\n   \n  The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy revoked $40 million in  federal funding  because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state’s effort to comply.\n \n\n   \n  The new rules for commercial driver’s licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa.\n \n\n   \n  H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n \n\n   \n  Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn’t have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver’s work permit expired — sometimes years after.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said the state followed guidance it received from the US Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2025 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/health/glp-1-hair-loss-telogen-effluvium-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Why some people lose their hair when they’re on GLP-1s","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the increasing trend of hair loss among individuals using GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound, primarily due to rapid weight loss and associated nutritional stress.

 \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.\n \n\n   \n  “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”\n \n\n   \n  A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,   diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.\n \n\n   \n  The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.\n \n\n   \n    What is telogen effluvium?\n \n\n   \n  There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.\n \n\n   \n  Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.\n \n\n   \n    Malnutrition may play a role\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.\n \n\n   \n  Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”   \n \n\n   \n  Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”\n \n\n   \n    Other theories\n \n\n   \n  There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.\n \n\n   \n  Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”\n \n\n   \n  Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum points to a  study  in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.\n \n\n   \n  “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.\n \n\n   \n  “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”\n \n\n   \n  A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.\n \n\n   \n  “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”\n \n\n   \n    Treatments for hair loss\n \n\n   \n  Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”\n \n\n   \n  That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.\n \n\n   \n  “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.\n \n\n   \n  “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”\n \n\n   \n  Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/eric-swalwell-mortgage-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"Bill Pulte refers Rep.

\n        4:16 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A leaking tanker truck spewed dangerous ammonia gas outside a hotel overnight, filling its hallways with fumes and forcing hundreds of nearby residents of a small Oklahoma city to evacuate, authorities said Thursday. Several dozen people were treated at hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak.\n \n\n   \n  An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor.\n \n\n   \n  Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He took off running, but noticed his roommate wasn’t with him and saw that he had run for their trucks. He said a police officer managed to save his coworker.\n \n\n   \n  “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red. His skin was all red.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson found one person stumbling and gave him a shirt to put over his mouth. At one point, he looked at the smoke and saw they were surrounded, thinking “We’re going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers.\n \n\n   \n  Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day.\n \n\n   \n  A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating.\n \n\n   \n  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago,  five people died  in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan.\n \n\n   \n  The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials.\n \n\n   \n  The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.”\n \n\n   \n  The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part. I know it’s your house, but you really have to go.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/signature-strike-drone-war-latin-america","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"‘Enemy KIA’: Trump revives playbook from Afghanistan for campaign targeting alleged drug boats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has launched a military campaign against drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, using tactics and language from the global war on terror — such as labeling traffickers as 'enemy combatants' and referring to killed individuals as 'enemy KIA.'

The attacks were part of a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at disrupting the operations of drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  But in a meeting the lawmakers expected would center around growing concerns over whether the military had the legal right to kill traffickers without knowing their identities and without trial, the two Pentagon briefers had left something behind: the military lawyers who had been scheduled to attend.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of the sudden cancellation by the lawyers was immediately seen by some of the lawmakers as a classic stonewalling tactic – with no lawyers around, the Pentagon officials could claim ignorance on legal questions – triggering the wry laughs in the secure room.\n \n\n   \n  But what the Pentagon officials did have to say that day struck several attendees as deeply troubling. It was the way briefers described those killed in the operations – so-called enemy combatants – that seemed to provide evidence that the administration was dusting off the playbook of the drone war in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The briefers discussed the strikes against alleged drug boats in nearly identical terms as those carried out in the Middle East during the global war on terror: Killed in Action, target signature, enemy combatants.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, wait a minute, enemy KIA, what war are we talking about here? What declared conflict am I missing?” one source familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In that and other briefings with lawmakers, military officials have acknowledged they didn’t know the names of those killed, the exact destination of their vehicles or have the documentation to prosecute them for their alleged crimes. But the targets’ actions fit the intelligence of what the briefers referred to as “terrorist” activity and so they were labeled as “enemy KIA,” or killed in action, a phrase used for decades to represent troops perishing on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East. But that campaign occurred during a period when US troops were routinely coming under enemy fire and were facing regular roadside bombings.\n \n\n   \n  US forces operating in and around Latin America have not reported taking fire, and the Pentagon has said no troops have been injured during its recent operations in the region. Nonetheless, the US military has conducted 20 strikes, destroying 21 boats while labeling those killed “narco-terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been explicit in drawing the comparison between terrorist groups and drug trafficking operations in Latin America, calling them the “Al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere.”\n \n\n   \n  “My advice to foreign terrorist organizations, do not get in a boat,” Hegseth said during a recent speech.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes against boats have used drones designed to carry hellfire missiles, the same combination of hardware that had been the backbone of the signature strike campaign in the Middle East, though CNN has reported that AC-130J gunships have also participated in some of the attacks in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  US officials have told Congress they do not need to identify individual targets before killing them – mirroring an argument made by past administrations to justify similar strikes against terror networks.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that a signature is misinterpreted or erroneous and an innocent party is attacked,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior adviser with the CSIS Defense and Security Department.\n \n\n   \n  He described how signature strikes in the Middle East used traits of a target, and how that same logic could be applied to drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Caribbean, that means that if a vessel exhibits characteristics a, b, and c, then it is presumed to be running drugs,” he said, though he added, “It’s possible that the administration has more direct information and is not releasing that to avoid compromising sources and methods.”\n \n\n   \n  But unlike during the war on terror, the Trump administration lacks Congressional authorization for a sustained military campaign against alleged drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of an opinion produced by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers, a distinction with a very clear difference compared to terror groups that have been targeted in similar strikes.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Trump administration lawyers appear to be relying heavily on the President’s broad Article II authority – the section of the Constitution that outlines the role of the president including their command of the military.\n \n\n   \n  Taken together, the Trump administration is testing the bounds of its authority to wage war abroad – fueling concerns among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who continue to question the president’s legal justification for the strikes. It has also raised questions as to what lessons the administration and military may or may not have learned from the decadeslong conflict in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  “How many briefings have I sat in at this point, where there’s some general or admiral sitting there and giving me vignettes about operations, and talking about the number of people they kill, enemy combatants they kill, their boats they blowing up, or tanks they’re blowing up, and how the mission was a success, and none of them could actually tell me what the strategy and endgame was and how they were going to measure success,” Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “And, so this is no different. I mean, they have learned nothing from our last 25 years, it seems,” Crow, who also served three tours in Iraq in Afghanistan and was an Army Ranger, added.\n \n\n   \n    Expansion of strikes\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s broader plan for the counter-drug campaign has not been articulated publicly, top officials have made clear that they intend to continue targeting smugglers using a similar playbook to the one used for killing terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  In practice, current and former US national security officials told CNN the two missions are not so different.\n \n\n   \n  “Network targeting is network targeting,” said one former US intelligence official with knowledge of the administration’s current strategy focused on dismantling drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, the “end state complicates things,” the former official added.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes against alleged drug boats started September 2, announced by President Donald Trump in a post on social media claiming that the boat was being operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. That first strike killed 11, Trump wrote, as he claimed that the gang was being directed by Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That was a theme in the early wave of strikes, as the Trump administration tried to tie Maduro to drug trafficking – namely fentanyl – while attacking boats near the Venezuelan coast in the Caribbean. It coincided with a massive buildup of military assets in the Caribbean, which now includes the Ford Carrier Strike Group and has raised questions about  whether the US intends to strike inside Venezuela  and potentially try to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  While those tensions continue to simmer, the boat strike campaign began to expand to the Pacific Ocean in late October, shifting focus from fentanyl to stopping the movement of cocaine. The announced targets also got less specific. Nearly all of the subsequent strikes including that first in the Pacific were against a “designated terrorist organization,” as announced by Hegseth, mirroring Global War on Terror framing of attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN also reported.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  But the shift to strikes in the Pacific has led to concerns from other countries in Latin America that the boat strike campaign signals a broadening that could only continue.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico has long been viewed by US officials as an epicenter of the drug trade, and Trump, himself, has repeatedly inquired about sending American troops across the southern border to target cartels based there.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s previous offers to send US forces into Mexico have been rebuffed, but the ongoing US military strikes have added a new wrinkle to the already delicate relationship between the two countries, as seen by an unexpected phone call on October 27.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Navy got a call from the Pentagon that day informing officials there may be a survivor in the Pacific Ocean from a US strike.\n \n\n   \n  The call — and the strike prompting it — surprised Mexico as US officials had provided no advance warning. While still in international waters, the incident happened near Mexico’s coast immediately raising concerns about the expansion of the US counter-narcotic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The two other known survivors from earlier strikes were briefly detained on a US Navy ship but ultimately repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia – amid questions about the legality of holding them, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  In Mexico City after the October 27 call, senior Mexican officials scheduled a meeting with the US ambassador to try to understand why Mexico, a close US partner working with the US on counter-drug operations already, was not aware of the strike and what to expect moving forward. A  readout of the meeting  described it as cordial and “aimed to strengthen bilateral coordination between Mexico and the Unted States on maritime matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Weeks later, the Mexican Navy has not located the survivor from that strike after having called off its formal search and the unnamed person is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Mexico has responded to Trump’s focus on the drug trade and framing of terrorist networks driving the trade by trying to placate the Trump administration with numbers— an effort begun well before the strikes commenced. In calls between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump, Sheinbaum has kept the US president updated on progress and metrics as it relates to crime. Trump administration officials said that the two leaders have developed a good relationship, despite Sheinbaum’s public opposition to the administration’s boat strikes, and continue to work together on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that countries cooperatively working with the US on drug smuggling efforts should not be concerned about unilateral US strikes on smugglers from their nations.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to help us find these people and blow them up if that’s what it takes. They’re going to help us with it,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Working with allies\n \n\n   \n  While there are strengths to effectively conducting a counter-terrorism mission at the US border, namely using the full power of the US intelligence community and military to identify vulnerabilities within these various groups, multiple current and former officials told CNN there are also obvious pitfalls.\n \n\n   \n  Those include issues related to collateral damage and managing political outrage from countries that are increasingly concerned the US may violate their sovereignty by conducting lethal strikes within their borders.\n \n\n   \n  Those are similar challenges to what US officials grappled with during the global war on terror.\n \n\n   \n  The former US intelligence official compared the US-Mexico dynamic to that of dealing with Pakistan during that time. Initially, the US refrained from conducting unilateral operations inside Pakistan’s borders, spending years asking for permission before carrying out strikes against suspected terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan never said no, the former official said, and the US eventually moved into a phase of simply notifying the country rather than asking for permission before a strike.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Pakistan, however, the Mexican government has repeatedly said no to Trump when he has raised the prospect of deploying the US military inside the country to target drug groups.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US intelligence officials have insisted that they are collaborating with the Mexican government when it comes to countering the flow of drugs and that any military or covert action carried out across the border will not be done unilaterally.\n \n\n   \n  But that has done little to ease the concerns of Mexican officials who believe that decision, ultimately, lies solely with the President.\n \n\n   \n  While all of the strikes to date have been at sea targeting boats allegedly carrying drugs, lawyers in the Trump administration have been debating potential justifications to extend those strikes to land, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  One strategy they have debated would be to identify land targets the US believes to be associated with drug trafficking and justifying those strikes with a second legal opinion that declares the host country unable or unwilling to address an imminent threat to Americans, sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said. Another possibility is to add Mexican cartels to an existing, secret list of 24 cartels and criminal organizations that the administration argues are legitimate targets. There’s no indication that a decision to conduct land strikes has been made.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the ongoing strikes in international waters are straining relations between the US and allies.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s reporting, Columbia President Gustavo Petro announced that he had ordered the country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the US stops the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  It was the escalation of a public spat between Trump and Petro, who in Columbia leads a country that has been a critical partner in US efforts to combat drugs.\n \n\n   \n  That dispute reached a fever pitch when one of the two survivors of US strikes who is Colombian was repatriated.\n \n\n   \n  The man was subsequently released by Colombian authorities due to a lack of evidence that he was an alleged trafficker, according to Petro, who has continued to question the US strategy of shoot-first and ask questions later.\n \n\n   \n  “Colombia’s prosecutor’s office, independent of the government, cannot investigate without evidence. Thousands of people we captured on boats with the seized cocaine are tried in Colombia, but the method of killing them and not seizing the evidence does not allow for trials; at most, only bodies are collected, without really knowing what they were transporting,” Petro posted on social media.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/air-travel-impact-government-reopening","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Government Reopening Signals Hope for Air Travel After Long Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government reopened on November 14, 2025, ending the longest shutdown in history through the passage of H.R. 5371, signed by President Donald Trump.

What’s that mean for air travel? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People flying home for Thanksgiving this month have their list of things to be thankful for: the turkey, football, time with family. This year, they can also   add  H.R. 5371   to the list.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the funding bill President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday to reopen the government,  ending  the longest government shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after  cuts mandated  by the Federal Aviation Administration led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings”  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But before they get to say grace with family, travelers are now praying Bastian’s assessment is right, even as many questions remain about how quickly air traffic controller staffing will stabilize and when Transportation Security Administration workers will   get paid.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.\n \n\n   \n    When will airlines stop canceling flights?\n \n\n   \n  The morning after the federal government reopened, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was filled with travelers keeping the hectic pace typical of the world’s busiest airport. But a closer look revealed something new: a palpable sense of relief in travelers.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that it will get back to some kind of normalcy or just a little bit better before the holidays,” Metreia White said, before boarding a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Hartsfield-Jackson is one of 40 major airports where airlines are still under  orders  from the FAA to cut   6% of their flights, many on shorter   regional routes . Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the cancellations have been necessary for safety because of air traffic controller staffing shortages during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Fridays and Saturdays have seen the most staffing problems throughout this time, according to data viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers missed  two paychecks  since   the shutdown started on  October 1 , and some are taking second jobs to make ends meet or calling in sick in protest.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been data-based,” Duffy said, citing examples of airplane mishaps at a  news conference  at Chicago O’Hare International Airport. “We’ve seen heightened complaints by pilots of the communication they’re having with air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  But “staffing levels …  improved dramatically ” when it became clear that a funding deal was coming, Bastian said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think our   air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown, and feel more hopeful, and they are coming in,” Duffy said on Tuesday. The  Department of Transportation  stopped short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers started showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain frozen at 6% until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  Logistics can also impact flight schedules, according to Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in a  statement  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Canceling one flight has a domino effect. They’ve had to move different airplanes in untraditional ways,” Sununu added at a news conference on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the challenges, airlines expect to rally quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a  statement  Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Southwest  said  on Wednesday they’re “seeing real progress, and air travel appears to be returning to normal. Our operation remains strong, and Customers can continue to count on Southwest.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines leaders told  employees  in a letter Thursday that they are optimistic about minimizing cancellations in time for the holiday.\n \n\n   \n  “It may take a few days for fully normal controller operations to resume, and we may need to continue to reduce schedules to comply with the FAA’s emergency order requirements,” wrote CEO Robert Ison and Chief Operating Officer David Seymour. “But we have seen promising signs and are confident that because of our strategic planning and work to minimize customer impacts throughout this period, we will recover quickly and deliver a strong Thanksgiving operation.”\n \n\n   \n    When do air traffic controllers get paid?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday her team finished up the administrative work necessary “ late last night ” so TSA employees could receive back pay for paychecks missed during the government shutdown as soon as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve already missed pay periods and recognizing that that’s a hardship on their families,” Noem  said . “So we did all of the administrative work that we needed to late last night to ensure that payroll would be processed as soon as possible, and within the next coming days, they will get that into their bank accounts.”\n \n\n   \n  A DHS spokesperson told CNN the agency “will be working to expedite pay for all employees who were furloughed or working without pay in an excepted status.”\n \n\n   \n  Noem also announced some TSA employees who “stepped up every single day” and “served with exemplary service” through the federal government shutdown would receive a  $10,000 bonus check .\n \n\n   \n  “They were all examples of what we need and we will be continuing to not only recognize employees across the country, but we will be looking at every single TSA official that helped serve during this government shutdown and do what we can to recognize that and help them financially with a bonus check to get them and their family back on their feet,” the secretary said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Duffy  said  that air traffic controllers were expected to get 70% of their back pay “anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens,” with the remainder to come a week later.\n \n\n   \n  Technicians who work on air traffic control equipment are also awaiting their back pay, said David Spero, national president of their union, PASS National.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is going to take time,” said Spero. “We’re going to have people with ongoing pay issues for a while.”\n \n\n   \n  He also said the technicians who continued to maintain air traffic control equipment through the shutdown deserve recognition, too.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking into it and reaching out to FAA leadership now,” Spero said Thursday. “Not one delay in the last 43 days has been attributed to a system outage or an equipment problem.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the long-term impacts on travel?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have acknowledged losing millions of dollars of revenue from the canceled flights, and industry leaders said travelers were getting wary of putting money down on a trip that might not happen.\n \n\n   \n  “The consumer is pulling back,” said Sununu. “Typically, airlines and hotels can be a leading indicator of where folks are spending their money in the economy.”\n \n\n   \n  US  domestic flights  are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site  Going.com , but it’s not clear how those prices were affected by the flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  One bit of ironic luck for both airlines and passengers in the midst of this misfortune, according to the Delta CEO, is that all major carriers were   equally impacted, so the financial loss shouldn’t result in higher ticket prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a competitive marketplace,” said Bastian. “Everyone went through the same thing.”\n \n\n   \n  The airline industry says in the future, the government should guarantee the stability of the air travel system, even in a shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA’s  Airport and Airway Trust Fund  currently has $5 billion that could be used to pay air traffic controllers during future shutdowns,” Airlines for America said in a  statement . “We ask Congress to consider legislation that would implement a long-term solution.”\n \n\n   \n  There are other impacts too, that won’t be solved by the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit,  Duffy told reporters this week , while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n    Could this happen again in January?\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through  January .\n \n\n   \n  That means that airlines and passengers may be grounded again in three months.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does is kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said it takes time to rebuild – both operations and morale – after disruptions like this to the travel industry.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot afford another self-inflicted crisis that threatens the systems millions rely on every day,” said Freeman.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Pete Muntean, Tami Luhby, Chris Boyette and Amanda Musa contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/hyundai-georgia-raid-korean-workers-back-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00-05:00","title":"Some Korean Workers Detained in Georgia Immigration Raid Have Returned to Their Jobs at Hyundai Site","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, over 300 South Korean nationals were detained during a U.S. immigration raid at Hyundai’s $7.6 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, where they were working under temporary business visas.

authorities, the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs said settlers attacked the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit in the northern West Bank, calling it a “heinous crime and a blatant assault on the feelings of Muslims.”\n \n\n   \n  “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens’ properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The settlers attacked the mosque early Thursday before morning prayers, according to the Mayor of Deir Istiya.\n \n\n   \n  “Many houses and cars were not attacked, but rather the attack was on a religious symbol to provoke Muslims with offensive phrases against the Prophet [Muhammad] and Muslims,” Abdul Rahim Zidan said in an interview with state-run Palestine TV.\n \n\n   \n  Images shared by the ministry showed writing in Hebrew on the exterior of the mosque saying, “Mohammed is a pig,” a reference to Islam’s prophet, and “Not afraid of Avi Bluth.” Bluth is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander in the West Bank, who issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the settler attacks and calling the perpetrators an “anarchist fringe youth.”\n \n\n   \n  Images showed parts of the interior damaged by fire, with a pile of charred debris scattered across the ground. The walls appear blackened with smoke and heat marks, and the glass of the windows smashed.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the attack in a statement, saying it “holds the Israeli government fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the IDF acknowledged the attack, saying it dispatched forces to the scene to “review the incident and conduct scans” and transferred the case to the Israel Police for further processing. The IDF said “no suspects were identified.”\n \n\n   \n  Some 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for a future state. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are considered illegal according to international law.\n \n\n   \n    Record number of settler attacks\n \n\n   \n  Settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties have surged this year, particularly during the olive harvest season in October and November. A United Nations report released last week found that Israeli settlers launched  at least 264 attacks  in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006. The repeated attacks have marred this year’s olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. The video showed smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women wailing as men carry extinguishers and water buckets in a scramble to douse the fires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN visited the site of the attack and saw charred vehicles, and the damage left around the Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was just a message to scare us, to scare our employees… to try to enforce their reality on the ground… (but) we will continue operations, they can’t stop us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack. They said settlers beat them and killed four of their sheep.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen-year-old Nabil Dueis was tending to his livestock when the settlers rampaged the area.\n \n\n   \n  “It was terrifying, especially for the women and children…I was defensless against 100 of them…we need protection from the state” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  According to the IDF, the settlers then attacked Israeli soldiers and damaged and Israeli military vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Police initially said it had arrested four suspects for questioning following what it called “extreme violence.” at the site. But by Wednesday evening, police said they had released three of the suspects.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian foreign ministry said the series of attacks “affirms the increasing terrorism and crimes of the settlers, carried out with the direct support of the occupation government, as part of a systematic and widespread policy aimed at undermining the rights of the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian officials called on international and Islamic institutions to take action to ensure accountability.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/lamonica-mciver-charges-new-jersey-immigration-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Judge Denies Rep.

McIver, a Democratic representative elected to represent New Jersey’s 10th district, was charged with three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with federal officials. Her legal team argued the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were protected under congressional oversight powers, citing a 2019 appropriations law allowing such inspections. However, Judge Jamel Semper ruled that McIver failed to prove the prosecution was selective or that her actions were disconnected from oversight duties, citing video evidence showing push-and-pull dynamics during a chaotic crowd scene.

LaMonica McIver, who was  charged with assaulting federal agents  during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her  May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center  in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver  has pleaded not guilty  and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  The acting US attorney in New Jersey,  Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision is pending.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a  2019 appropriations bill  spelling out that authority.\n \n\n   \n  McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/supreme-court-brown-v-board-race-affirmative-action-voting-rights-education","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Examining Brown v.

Board, race and ‘equal protection’ through the eyes of the modern Supreme Court \n       \n  By Joan Biskupic, CNN Chief Supreme Court Analyst\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Supreme Court heard arguments in a racially charged  Louisiana voting rights case  last month, down on its ground floor a special exhibit was running a continual loop of commentary from Chief Justice John Roberts and others extolling the desegregation ruling of Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit takes advantage of the  restored bench  used by US district court Judge Ronald Davies, who ordered the enrollment of nine Black students at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Three years after the Brown ruling, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus was still fighting school integration.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s  Cooper v. Aaron  decision, arising from that Arkansas standoff, declared the state bound by Brown and reinforced the mandate of desegregation.\n \n\n   \n  The tone of the justices’ commentary in a video is lofty, such as from Justice Brett Kavanaugh: “Brown v. Board of Education is the single greatest moment, single greatest decision, in this court’s history. And the reason for that is that it enforced a constitutional principle, ‘equal protection of the laws,’ ‘equal justice under law,’ and made that real for all Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the concept of “equal protection of the laws” has shrunk with the modern Supreme Court. That has been evident in the justices’ rulings on race-based measures in education. And  during oral arguments  in the Louisiana case, Kavanaugh was among the justices who suggested the era of racial remedies, in education and voting, must end.\n \n\n   \n  As race endures as a flashpoint for the justices, the court has weakened the spirit and reach of Brown. A series of impending cases may further erode civil rights milestones.\n \n\n   \n  “Brown is a shell now,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, former president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the organization that took the lead in Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  “They will never reverse it,” she said of the justices. “They will just hollow it out. It’s a much more cynical project than rejecting it outright. … It is still incumbent upon this court to reconcile the decisions they’re making today with the truth of that decision.”\n \n\n   \n   Brown’s legacy , say civil rights advocates, permits race to be used in remedial policies to ensure equal opportunity and to enhance diversity. They contend Brown never required governments to be blind to race, especially as prejudice and discrimination endure.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority that controls today’s court has been advancing a “colorblind” ideal and rejecting the kind of race-conscious remedies upheld for decades to address historic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts, Kavanaugh and others on the right-wing envision a country now in an era of racial neutrality, or as the  chief justice famously wrote in 2007 , “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  New cases are on the horizon as activists continue to take advantage of the court’s trend. The group that challenged Harvard and won a 2023 decision striking down race-based college admissions has filed a series of new lawsuits in lower courts, including one challenging the practice of Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii of giving a preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian ancestry.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the pending Louisiana dispute that began with a NAACP Legal Defense Fund claim of vote dilution in redistricting, the justices are scheduled this month to consider appeals that would test whether advocacy groups and other private parties can even bring such Voting Rights Act claims.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  accelerated  a separate line of litigation with its effort to end what’s known as “disparate impact” liability. Such lawsuits have traditionally been brought when an employer imposes a seemingly neutral policy that disproportionately hurts Blacks and other groups protected by civil rights law.\n \n\n   \n  A gap exists between the court’s declarations of equality and the country’s reality, especially considering the Trump administration’s diminishment of civil rights laws that date to the 1960s and its desire to end diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “The justices have been equating equal protection to colorblindness, and in doing that they are ignoring a history of structural racism and the continuing effects that give Black people and other people of color less opportunity,” said Jon Greenbaum, who for more than a decade was chief counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and last year founded Justice Legal Strategies.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going through a period of time where we need greater protection from the court rather than reduced protection,” said Greenbaum, the co-counsel in lawsuits arising from President Donald Trump’s removal of certain officials from independent agencies, such as the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n \n\n   \n    Division over what Brown means\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s reinterpretation of the 1954 Brown v. Board landmark was underway long before Trump first came to office. With Chief Justice Roberts at the lead, the court has ruled against school integration plans and  race-based admissions .\n \n\n   \n  The nine justices came together to offer video commentary for their Brown v. Board of Education exhibit tucked in an alcove behind the oversized sculpture of Chief Justice John Marshall. But they are themselves riven over what Brown means.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2023  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard  decision ending university race-based admissions, Roberts wrote for a six-justice majority that Brown stands for the principle that “eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” even measures that help traditionally excluded Black and Hispanic students.\n \n\n   \n  The three liberal dissenters countered, “Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. … In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts’ limited view of Brown was first on full display in the 2007 dispute over school-integration plans. He relied on the landmark as he invalidated efforts to diversify public schools in Seattle and Louisville.\n \n\n   \n  “Before  Brown , schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” Roberts wrote. “The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again—even for very different reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted Justice John Paul Stevens to declare in dissent, “There is a cruel irony in The Chief Justice’s reliance on our decision in  Brown  v.  Board of Education.  … The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to reject the Seattle and Kentucky school-integration plans in that 2007 controversy, separated himself from the Roberts’ view of Brown and his “all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor” to ensure equal opportunity in schools.\n \n\n   \n  Wrote Kennedy, who retired in 2018, succeeded by Kavanaugh: “The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion.”\n \n\n   \n    Voting Rights Act\n \n\n   \n  The Louisiana redistricting case heard in October arises as the court has been erasing the protections of another milestone of the country’s civil rights era: The 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the arguments, the conservative majority may further restrict remedies for maps that dilute the electoral power of Blacks and Hispanics, particularly in the South.\n \n\n   \n  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act only after the March 7, 1965, “Bloody Sunday” attack on civil rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama. State troopers and other police assaulted the marchers with tear gas, clubs and whips.\n \n\n   \n  The pending VRA case traces to 2022, when Louisiana legislators drew a congressional-district map in which Blacks had the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the six districts, despite the fact that Blacks make up about a third of the population in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A lower US district court ruled that the map diluted Blacks’ electoral power and likely violated the Voting Rights Act; it ordered the state to redraw the map with two Black-majority districts. After the new map was crafted with two districts, White voters sued. The question for the justices is whether that second district unconstitutionally divided people by race.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a new question in a pair of appeals to be reviewed in the justices’ private conference on November 21 turns on whether only the US Justice Department – not private groups – can sue under the VRA to challenge redistricting that dilutes the power of minority voters. The  8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a case  brought by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippawa Indians that that the VRA lacks a provision for such private lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  If the high court were to adopt that approach, few suits to vindicate voting rights would likely be brought. The Justice Department under Trump has retrenched on voting rights litigation. Even administrations interested in broadly enforcing the VRA had limited litigation resources and relied on private advocacy groups.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It was like a ray of hope’\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit highlighting Brown and the bench used by Judge Davies, known as the “Cooper Bench,” is scheduled to remain at the Supreme Court until next summer. Then the artifacts will  return to a permanent exhibit  in Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n  In the current video, the justices touch on dramatic highpoints, including Davies’ bravery in the face of threats and violence, President Dwight Eisenhower’s order of the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, and the leadership of lawyer Thurgood Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  Marshall, as lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, developed the strategy against the “separate but equal” doctrine. In 1967, he became the first Black Supreme Court justice.\n \n\n   \n  The only Black justices since Marshall are Thomas, who succeeded him in 1991, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  The views of Thomas and Jackson on racial remedies and the legacy of Brown are the opposite. They  fiercely clashed  in the SFFA v. Harvard case.\n \n\n   \n  In the exhibit film, they offer observations from personal experience. Jackson refers to her parents, who grew up in the era of segregation, and were able to see her become a Supreme Court  justice.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas recalls the reverence people showed to Brown v. Board in his youth: “They would say ‘Brown,’ as though they had the familiarity of a constitutional scholar. ‘Brown.’”\n \n\n   \n  “For people who were unlettered, for people who were living in that system,” Thomas also relates, “Brown was a godsend, because it said that what was happening that we thought was wrong, they now know that this court said it was also wrong. It’s wrong, not just morally, but under the Constitution of the United States. It was like a ray of hope.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-20:53","title":"Gregory Bovino and CBP Head to Charlotte, North Carolina: City Officials Caught Off Guard by Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration, is reportedly heading to Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of a targeted immigration enforcement campaign.

That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials are in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/nevada-supreme-court-fake-electors-case","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Nevada Supreme Court rules case against pro-Trump 'fake electors' can proceed in Las Vegas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that a case against pro-Trump 'fake electors' who falsely claimed Donald Trump won Nevada in December 2020 must proceed, overturning a lower court's dismissal on venue grounds.

\n   \n  The Nevada Supreme Court handed a victory Thursday to Democratic state prosecutors who charged the state’s pro-Trump “fake electors” from 2020.\n \n\n   \n  The court ruled that the case should proceed in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the bulk of the state’s Democratic electorate. A lower court  previously dismissed  the case on the grounds that it was filed in the wrong venue, forcing prosecutors to  refile the case  instead in Carson City, the more conservative state capital.\n \n\n   \n  Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat who is prosecuting the case, praised the ruling in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The 2020 fake electors cannot evade accountability in Nevada for their unlawful actions,” he said. “As attorney general, it is my duty to hold those who sought to undermine the results of our state’s free and fair election responsible.”\n \n\n   \n  The high court sided with the state prosecutors, who preferred that the case proceed in Las Vegas, which might have a more favorable jury pool than Carson City.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, President Donald Trump  granted federal pardons  to many of the “fake electors” from 2020, including those in Nevada, who tried to subvert the Electoral College process. However, those pardons only cover potential federal offenses, and the Nevada case alleges that the fake electors violated state law.\n \n\n   \n  The so-called fake electors have pleaded not guilty and deny wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The six Republicans facing charges signed fake certificates in December 2020, falsely proclaiming that Trump had beaten Joe Biden in the state.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump campaign used that phony certificate, and similar documents from six other states, to try to overturn the result of the 2020 election when Congress met on January 6, 2021, to count the electoral votes.\n \n\n   \n  Efforts by state investigators to prosecute the fake electors have had mixed results. A case filed by Michigan’s Democratic attorney general was dismissed this year due to lack of evidence. A case in Georgia is stalled.

first known death from meat allergy triggered by tick bites \n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:44 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the summer of 2024, a previously healthy 47-year-old father collapsed and died in the bathroom of his New Jersey home. An autopsy provided no answers. Everything looked normal, and his death was ruled sudden and unexplained.\n \n\n   \n  His widow reached out to a friend, a pediatrician. Would she read the autopsy report?\n \n\n   \n  The pediatrician, Dr. Erin McFeely, acted on a hunch and contacted Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia who had discovered almost two decades earlier that tick bites could cause people to develop an allergy to red meat.\n \n\n   \n  The allergy is unusual because the reaction doesn’t happen right away. People start to feel sick hours after they unwittingly eat beef, pork or lamb. Often, they’ll wake up in the middle of the night with symptoms that seem more like a bad bout of food poisoning or stomach flu than an allergy.\n \n\n   \n  Because so many people have potentially been sensitized to meat after tick bites but don’t know it, Platts-Mills and others have wondered whether there were unexplained deaths that were really severe reactions to a sugar found on mammalian cells, including those in red meat, called alpha-gal.\n \n\n   \n   The man’s case , which was detailed Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, turned out to be exactly what Platts-Mills had feared and is believed to be the first documented death linked to a red meat allergy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time I’ve heard a story that I thought we could sort out,” said Platts-Mills, who is part scientist and part Sherlock Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  “We need the serum” – the clear part of the patient’s blood – which was taken during his autopsy. He asked McFeely, “Can we get it?”\n \n\n   \n    Tick bites turn deadly\n \n\n   \n  The man’s story started with chigger bites, the case study says. But they weren’t chiggers; they were baby lone star ticks, about the size and color of a grain of sand.\n \n\n   \n  The man had been bitten by dozens of these tiny seed ticks on a camping trip with his family.\n \n\n   \n  “And this tick, the mothers, lay 5,000 eggs at a time, and the larvae will bite you,” Platts-Mills told CNN . \n \n\n   \n  In many parts of the eastern United States, the deer population has reached unsustainable numbers. Deer are the main hosts of the lone star tick, and as deer populations have grown, tick populations have exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “That combination of so many deer and so many mothers and the larvae biting means that vast numbers of people are sensitized, of whom a minority get food-related symptoms and then are at risk of severe events,” Platts-Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Alpha-gal allergy is a reportable diagnosis in only three states – Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia – so the actual number of cases in the US is not known. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  that as many as 450,000 Americans may have the allergy, but Platts-Mills estimates that as much as 5% of the population may be sensitized to red meat because of tick bites and not know it.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are not severe and can be managed by avoiding exposure to the sugar, which is found in food as well as in some pharmaceutical products. Symptoms range in severity from itchy hives or a rash to nausea and vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the lips or face, dizziness or fainting, and severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnose the condition by taking a careful history and controlled testing for a reaction to the sugar.\n \n\n   \n  Sometime after the camping trip, the case study says, the man’s family ate a late steak dinner. He woke at 2 a.m. with intense stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. He was in rough shape, but after two hours, his symptoms subsided.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, he told one of his sons, “I thought I was going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  His wife said they considered going to a doctor, but since the symptoms had eased, they didn’t know what they would say.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that a doctor’s visit would have helped. Too often, doctors don’t recognize alpha-gal allergy.  A 2023 CDC survey  found that 42% didn’t know what it was, and 35% said they lacked confidence to diagnose or manage it.\n \n\n   \n    An unrecognized allergy\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks later, in September 2024, the man and his wife went to a cookout, where he had a hamburger about 3 p.m. He drank a beer and came home and mowed the lawn. But by 7:20 p.m., he was vomiting again. His son called his mother and told her, “Dad is getting sick again.”\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the son found his father unconscious on the bathroom floor. He couldn’t be revived.\n \n\n   \n  Platts-Mills says that when he   was back in his lab, having gone through the necessary layers of permission to get the man’s postmortem blood samples, he cursed himself for not driving up to New Jersey to collect them himself.\n \n\n   \n  The delivery company lost track of them briefly, he said. He imagined them sitting for hours in the back of a hot truck, the valuable information they contained being baked away.\n \n\n   \n  They finally arrived in his lab in April, and he tested them for levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies, Y-shaped proteins primed to latch onto allergens like ragweed and pollen. The man had antibodies to both alpha-gal sugars and red meat.\n \n\n   \n  Next, Platts-Mills sent some of the blood to the Mayo Clinic lab, which tested it for an enzyme called tryptase that’s made by immune cells called mast cells. Tryptase breaks down proteins and is a marker of allergic reactions.\n \n\n   \n  The man’s tryptase levels were over 2,000 nanograms per milliliter, among the highest values ever recorded in cases of fatal allergic reactions called anaphylaxis.\n \n\n   \n  The man had died of eating red meat – the first known food allergy fatality linked to alpha-gal syndrome.\n \n\n   \n  Other people  have died of reactions to alpha-gal sugars , but those cases have involved sugars attached to a chemotherapy drug called cetuximab, which was how the syndrome was discovered in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “We gave them closure,” Platts-Mills said of the family in the case study.   “People make a big fuss about closure, but you don’t get it until you see it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/paul-ingrassia-general-services-administration-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00-05:00","title":"Ingrassia Serving in New Role in Trump Administration After Withdrawing Nomination for Whistleblower Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, a former nominee for the Office of Special Counsel in the Trump administration, withdrew his nomination after allegations surfaced of racist text messages, including references to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and derogatory remarks about Asians and Native Americans.

      \n  By Yoonjung Seo, Brad Lendon, Mike Valerio, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:40 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Secret drone flights from South Korea to the heart of Pyongyang were part of a ploy by the former president to rattle the North Korean leader, South Korean prosecutors have alleged as they released new details of plot they say preceded a foiled attempt to  declare martial law. \n \n\n   \n  Memos found on a senior defense official’s phone purportedly reveal plans by former president Yoon Suk Yeol and two other senior defense officials to aggravate Kim Jong Un enough to justify a shocking late-night military control order issued last December.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the evidence on Monday, appearing to confirm North Korea’s claims that South Korea sent covert drones to the country to drop anti-regime leaflets last October. The flights prompted a rare and fiery statement from Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s powerful sister.\n \n\n   \n  The North vowed to sever all road and rail connections to the South,  blowing up two roads  within its territory, but stopping short of military action. Weeks later, Yoon declared martial law, citing the need to protect the liberal South from “North Korean communist forces.”\n \n\n   \n  The snap decree was lifted within hours when South Korean lawmakers pushed past troops to vote it down, the first step in a reckoning for Yoon that’s still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n   A new indictment Monday  adds to Yoon’s mounting legal battles, which include a trial underway for alleged insurrection, and provides more pieces to a political puzzle that’s yet to be fully explained.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon denies he ordered drones to fly to Pyongyang to provoke North Korea and that he attempted to stage an insurrection through martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, called the indictment “a one-sided prosecution” that “fails to uphold even the basic tenets of legal logic, beyond being absurd.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the spokesperson and a prosecutor for the counsel, Park Ji-young, said prosecutors were “appalled” at what they had uncovered – and on Monday they released memos they say support their claim.\n \n\n   \n    Drones buzzing Kim’s home\n \n\n   \n  The allegations date back to last October, when North Korean state media reported that South Korean drones had  violated Pyongyang’s airspace  on multiple occasions, dropping anti‑regime leaflets.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released photos showing one drone lodged in a tree, described by analysts as resembling a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA also showed images of a drone it said was spotted flying low in the skies above the home of North’s Korean authoritarian supreme leader.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Byung-joo, a retired Korean Army four-star general now a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party, which sits in opposition to Yoon’s former party, told CNN in July that he had received details of the drone flights directly from whistleblowers of South Korea’s Drone Operations Command.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kim, the flights took place on at least three occasions, October 3, October 8-9, and November 13 of last year.\n \n\n   \n  “It is believed that by sending drones into the heart of North Korea and dropping leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un, the aim was to provoke a military response from the North,” the South Korean lawmaker told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like holding a knife to (North Korea’s) neck,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Kim Yo Jong issued her statement on October 12, condemning the airspace incursions and warning of “severe consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Kim Yong-hyun, then South Korea’s defense minister, initially denied sending drones to North Korea, but soon changed his response to say he “could not confirm” North Korea’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  After Yoon’s disastrous attempt to impose martial law, lawmakers from the now ruling Democratic Party demanded an inquiry into allegations the former president conspired to spark a national security crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Once in power, the lawmakers passed a bill to appoint an independent counsel, who released memos on Monday that they say reveal evidence of covert discussions about Yoon’s plans to provoke North Korea, a country with a long history of bombastic threats against South Korea and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  Among notes found on a phone belonging to the former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung were references to creating an “unstable situation,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Must find and exploit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that can produce short-term effects. To do that, we must create an unstable situation or seize an opportunity that has been created,” read one note drafted October 18 last year, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Another note read: “Targeting where (North Korea) loses face to such an extent that they feel they have no option but to respond.” Locations listed included the capital, two nuclear facilities, Kim’s vacation homes, as well as Samjiyon and Wonsan.\n \n\n   \n  Samjiyon is regarded as a sacred site in North Korea for being the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, and a symbolic location tied to his grandfather’s anti-Japanese resistance.\n \n\n   \n  The Wonsan-Kalma tourist area is one of Kim Jong Un’s flagship development projects, that has been hailed as a “great success” by the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Another memo from October 23 stated, “Goal and final status,” containing phrases such as “At minimum-national security crisis” and “At maximum-Noah’s flood,” in a possible reference to Noah’s Ark, where the only survivors of a biblical flood were those on board a mighty ship.\n \n\n   \n  A later note dated November 5 stated, “Enemy action must come first. There must be a wartime situation or a situation that cannot be controlled by police forces. Create the enemy’s conditions… we must wait for the decisive opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Park, the prosecutor’s spokesperson, said further details could not be disclosed due to laws concerning military secrets.\n \n\n   \n  However, she added that evidence from a notebook belonging to former Defense Intelligence Commander Noh Sang-won suggested that discussions and preparations for the martial law were believed to have begun no later than October 2023, after a major reshuffle of South Korea’s military generals.\n \n\n   \n  “The (alleged) act of the President, who holds supreme command over national security, and the defense minister, attempting to use inter-Korean military tensions to create conditions for declaring martial law, is absolutely unacceptable,” said Park.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmaker Kim Byung-joo, the retired general, said he was surprised the North Korean leader did not order a response after alleged South Korean drones were spotted over the capital.\n \n\n   \n  “In hindsight, it was a godsend luck for South Korea that North Korea refrained from any military provocation and stopped at rhetorical threats,” he said. “Had North Korea chosen to respond with military action under those circumstances, it could have escalated into a localized conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s deployment of more than 10,000 troops to Russia as combat soldiers in the war against Ukraine may have dissuaded Kim from acting further, said Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “North Korea could have found it difficult to maintain two war fronts, at the time. Because it would have meant causing a significant gap in combat capability.”\n \n\n   \n    A frustrated leader’s shocking act\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, and his former defense officials Kim and Yeo, all face charges of harming the interest of the state by helping the enemy and abusing their power. The three are already on trial on insurrection charges relating to the  martial law declaration. \n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military has yet to comment on the investigation or the indictment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.  CNN has reached out to lawyers for Kim and Yeo. According to local media, Yeo has said he deeply regrets not challenging Yoon’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, a firebrand conservative who has long taken a hardline on North Korea, narrowly won election in 2022, but his ruling party never had a majority in parliament, and struggled to get its legislative agenda passed. It was a source of constant frustration for his administration, and towards the end of last year, that frustration exploded in spectacular fashion.\n \n\n   \n  On December 3, Yoon declared martial law in a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within the opposition parties in the government that were sympathetic to North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopters and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television.\n \n\n   \n  Though assembly members pushed through the soldiers and voted to overturn the martial law decree, Yoon’s actions triggered mass protests, legal challenges, and ultimately, his removal through impeachment.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say sending drone flights into North Korea could have been interpreted as an act of war, provoking a military response that could have escalated into war.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Peninsula has been divided ever since a brutal war between the North and South ended with an armistice agreement in 1953. But the hostilities have never officially ended and relations between the two neighbors have been precarious ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said if Yoon had ordered the drone flights, it “would represent a dangerous interaction of domestic politics and security policy” in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  “While some national security activities are necessarily clandestine and operate in legal gray areas, robust checks, balances, and policy vetting should ensure they serve national interests rather than personal agendas,” Easley said.\n \n\n   \n  Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the potential international ramifications of the case are considerable, especially for the United States, a South Korean treaty ally with tens of thousands of troops at bases on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Drone flights into North Korea, he added, would violate the armistice agreement between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that the North Koreans violate the armistice all the time, but they’re not held politically accountable for it at home,” he said. “In a democracy like South Korea you can be held politically accountable for that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/uk/sami-hamdi-uk-us-ice-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:42:00-05:00","title":"British journalist says ICE detention was ‘attack on freedoms’ after 18-day ordeal in US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British journalist Sami Hamdi, a political commentator known for his pro-Palestinian views and criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza, was detained for 18 days by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after attending a CAIR event in California.

\nUpdated: \n        7:42 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A British journalist and political commentator  detained  by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained  Sami Hamdi , a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport. ICE stopped him the day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala, while he was en route to Florida to speak at a similar event.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza as “political retaliation.”   \n \n\n   \n  Hamdi recounted his 18 day ordeal to CNN shortly after his return to London.\n \n\n   \n  “When I entered San Francisco airport to fly to Florida, I went through security. As I looked for my gate, D38 to Tampa, a man walked up to me and said… ‘your visa was revoked two days ago, so now you are here illegally.’”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said the news came as a surprise, and he told the officials who had approached him that he had not been informed his visa was under review. He said he was then presented with a memo from the US State Department that said his visa had been revoked, without a reason as to why.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about any evidence that would show that Hamdi had overstayed his visa on Thursday, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told CNN that he wasn’t able to speak on specific cases but said: “We’re going to enforce our immigration laws…We’re revoking visas when appropriate, in line with our national security.”   \n \n\n   \n  At the airport, Hamdi said he asked officers for an explanation for the revocation, saying that if there wasn’t one, he would just “book my ticket to London and fly home.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the officers then told him: “‘That’s not the way this works here,’” before escorting him out of the terminal to a vehicle that was waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said he was told to get in the car, but initially refused, telling the officers: “With the greatest of respect, this looks like the movies. I’m not getting in any black car. I’m a British citizen. I have rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his appearances on British TV, his analyses on Middle East developments, for his support of the Palestinian cause – and his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After advocating for a phone call, Hamdi, said he briefly spoke with CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties organization, before he was taken to an ICE facility over four hours away.\n \n\n   \n  “They loaded me into a van with tight cuffs on my feet and on my hands, and they drove me four hours…and a half… I had to do a swap in the middle with a different car. And then they took me to the middle of nowhere,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.\n \n\n   \n  Despite never being charged with a crime, Hamdi said he was kept in shackles in for-profit facilities with little oversight.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality is that those those facilities are dehumanizing to the human beings (there), and when you look at the stories of the other inmates, it only breaks your heart,” he said, recounting multiple stories of fathers with green cards who had been detained without charge.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not that the courts won’t find them innocent, it’s that it seems there’s a concerted effort to make sure they do not go in front of a judge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi said shortly after he returned back to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi first came under fire after speaking at an event in London in 2023 following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. There, he told his audience not to pity Palestinians but rather to “celebrate the victory,”    in remarks from a speech that he told CNN were taken out of context.\n \n\n   \n  In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “My argument was that we have to solve the issue of the rights of the Palestinians. We have to solve the issue of occupation, apartheid, and that will bring peace to the region,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” he said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he added, alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights organizations have criticized the actions of the Trump administration, saying that they violate free speech protections, which apply to anyone who is legally in the US, regardless of citizenship status.\n \n\n   \n  Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  While Hamdi said he is mulling whether to sue US authorities, he also said he would rather take what he considers a win, and instead “celebrate” the decisions of the “cool heads” in the US State Department and federal court system.\n \n\n   \n  “I won this case, the extremists failed to silence my voice, they failed to remove my freedom of speech. America stood with me,” he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending time with his family and a game of soccer over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  While he said he is grateful for the global attention brought to his case, he also implied that he is keen to exit the limelight.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story is about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-mvp-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:25:00-05:00","title":"Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani unanimously voted MVP for fourth time; Yankees’ Aaron Judge named AL’s back-to-back winner","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge have each been unanimously named MVPs for the 2025 MLB season, with Ohtani winning the National League award for the second year in a row and Judge winning the American League award for the second consecutive year.

In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.\n \n\n   \n  The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a  historic season  last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all  30 votes  to win unanimously.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That’s first and foremost, it’s icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”\n \n\n   \n  He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB’s all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.\n \n\n   \n  Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.\n \n\n   \n  Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he’s won.\n \n\n   \n  “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today’s game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”\n \n\n   \n  Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher  Cal Raleigh  and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with  17  first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn’t beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”\n \n\n   \n  With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates’ 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year. Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin was named the NL Rookie of the Year.\n \n\n   \n  Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was named the NL Manager of the Year and Guardians manager Stephen Vogt won AL Manager of the Year for the second consecutive year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/jesse-jackson-hospitalized-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:04:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Rev.

Jesse Jackson has been hospitalized, according to a statement obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, 84, a protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), the Rainbow PUSH Coalition said Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “He has been managing this neurodegenerative condition for more than a decade,” the organization said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “He was originally diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease ;  however, last April ,  his PSP condition was confirmed. The family appreciates all prayers at this time.”\n \n\n   \n   Further details about his condition have not been released. However, there has been “significant improvement” in the civil rights leader’s condition over the last 24 hours under medical care, his son Jesse Jackson Jr. said Thursday in a segment during his weekday radio show.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of the Jackson family, we cannot extend enough of our gratitude for those of you who have expressed your thoughts and prayers,” he said on his KBLA show, “The Jesse Jackson Jr. Show.”\n \n\n   \n  PSP is “a rare neurological disorder that affects body movements, walking and balance, and eye movements,” according to the  US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .\n \n\n   \n  The disease typically begins in a person’s 60s and has some symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, it adds. Most people with PSP develop severe disability within three to five years.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s son said he started receiving text messages from his mother towards the end of his radio show on Wednesday, sharing that his father “was not having a good day.” By the time he got to him, his father was already in the ambulance, with police and the fire department at the scene, Jackson Jr. said on his show.\n \n\n   \n  “I jumped out of my car and jumped into the ambulance and rode to the hospital,” Jackson Jr. said. “The doctors were able to work on him to get him the necessary fluids he needs to sustain him.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson rose to national prominence in the 1960s and has spent more than six decades advocating for racial equality, economic justice and voter rights.\n \n\n   \n  In 1971, he founded Operation PUSH as a way to improve Black communities’ economic conditions across the US.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson  later launched  the National Rainbow Coalition, in 1984, with the goal of obtaining equal rights for all Americans, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Some 12 years later, the two organizations merged to form Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  The organization’s origins stemmed from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s Operation Breadbasket, founded by King,  according to the website .\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s health drew public attention in 2017 when he spoke openly about his  diagnosis of Parkinson’s , an incurable disease characterized by tremors, stiffness and impaired movement.\n \n\n   \n  “My family and I began to notice changes about three years ago,” Jackson wrote in a statement at the time, calling the recognition of the symptoms “painful,” and noting Parkinson’s was the disease “that bested my father.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he took   the diagnosis as “a signal that I must make lifestyle changes and dedicate myself to physical therapy in hopes of slowing the disease’s progression.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Jackson faced several health challenges, including gallbladder surgery and Covid-19 hospitalization with his wife. Later that year, he suffered a fall and hit his head while attending a meeting at Howard University in Washington, DC, and was kept in the hospital overnight for observation.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2023, Jackson announced his retirement as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, succeeded by Rev.

The BBC is signaling that it will fight.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the British national broadcaster responded to a  demand letter  from Trump’s lawyers by  apologizing for an editing error  but arguing that the president doesn’t have a serious case.\n \n\n   \n  The public response indicated that if Trump goes ahead and sues, the BBC will vigorously defend itself, rather than immediately seek to settle the matter out of court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a pivotal moment in the ongoing tug-of-war between Trump and the news outlets that strive to report on him independently and confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is a fight about stopping Trump from deploying his pattern of intimidation, bluster and threats against an organization that plays a huge role in setting the global media agenda,” Joel Simon, the founding director of the Journalism Protection Initiative, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Simon, who has been  chronicling  the BBC’s efforts to expand in the US, said the dustup is also “about the ability of the British public to determine what kind of media it wants, and what kind of BBC, without Trump mucking it up.”\n \n\n   \n  In the US this year, Trump has proven adept at applying political and legal pressure to media owners — and has squeezed settlement payments and other concessions out of some, but not all, of them.\n \n\n   \n  Media critics and consumers have worried that Trump’s attempts at intimidation and dominance have caused journalists to soften and self-censor aggressive reporting.\n \n\n   \n  But some newsroom leaders and media moguls have recognized that Trump’s tests are an opportunity to reaffirm their independence.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC seems to be doing that.\n \n\n   \n  As outgoing BBC director general Tim Davie said the other day, “We have to fight for our journalism.”\n \n\n   \n    No payout, no retreat\n \n\n   \n  Let’s be clear about what happened: Someone at the BBC’s “Panorama” newsmagazine program screwed up by stitching together two different clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech hours ahead of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  No one seemed to notice the error when the documentary first aired in October 2024. But when the editing error was publicized last week, the BBC was too slow to address the controversy, giving Trump even more of an opening to target the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness  resigned on Sunday , citing the need for leaders to take responsibility, even though the mistake was made much further down the editorial chain.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, BBC chair Samir Shah acknowledged an “error in judgment” with the clip. By then, Florida-based lawyers for Trump had sent the BBC a letter claiming the documentary caused Trump “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and warning of a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts scoffed at the letter, saying Trump’s chances of winning such a lawsuit were low.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has pursued other legal claims in the past despite a similarly low likelihood of success. And some institutions have folded under the pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Disney , the parent of ABC, and  Paramount , the parent of CBS, decided to strike settlement deals with Trump rather than risk court battles. Both media companies made payments toward Trump’s future presidential library, triggering widespread outrage.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as the BBC said it received a legal threat from Trump, speculation arose about a similar payout by the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  But there has been no such settlement or secret side deal, a senior BBC source told CNN. And if such a payout were ever to occur, it would be publicly disclosed. The BBC, after all, is primarily funded through license fees paid by British taxpayers.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s own news coverage of Thursday’s legal reply to Trump emphasized that the broadcaster had “rejected his demands for compensation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s lawyers had given the BBC a Friday deadline to respond. The president had no immediate reaction to the broadcaster’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    The pros and cons of standing tall\n \n\n   \n  News outlets that have stood up to Trump this year have garnered praise from readers. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, for instance, are both fighting suits that were filed on Trump’s behalf by the same Florida law firm.\n \n\n   \n  The suit against The Times was initially  thrown out  by a judge in September for being “decidedly improper and impermissible.”\n \n\n   \n  When the lawyers refiled a shorter version, The Times was forceful in its response. “As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: This lawsuit has no merit,” a newspaper spokesperson said. “This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate P.R. attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n \n\n   \n  Media executives have pointed out, however, that court battles can be costly and unpredictable.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials may find themselves hoping that Trump gets distracted and moves on to a new target.\n \n\n   \n  When Disney briefly suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration in September, the consumer backlash was swift, including in the form of Disney+ subscriber cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  And when Disney brought Kimmel back on the air — showing a willingness to fight after briefly deciding to fold — Trump made one more blustery threat against ABC. But then he evidently moved on; the government hasn’t taken any known action against the network, and the president hasn’t brought up Kimmel in nearly two months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/middleeast/deceased-israeli-hostage-identified-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:01:00Z","title":"Israel Identifies Deceased Hostage Returned by Hamas as Manny Godard","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified Manny Godard, a 73-year-old resident of Be’eri Kibbutz near Gaza, as a deceased hostage returned by Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attack.

His body was then taken to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  During the attack, Godard and his wife hid in the safe room of their home in Be’eri Kibbutz.

After the father of four was killed, “Ayelet hid in the bushes for several hours before she was also murdered,” the forum added.\n \n\n   \n  Godard spent his childhood on Israeli beaches alongside his father, who was a lifeguard, the forum said.

On Sunday, Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the final days of a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The transfer of Goldin’s remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.

Nicolás Maduro  told CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon in the middle of a rally in Caracas on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  His exclusive remarks come amid heightened tensions with the US, which has  deployed warships  to the Caribbean to target what it claims are drug trafficking vessels from Venezuela. Though Washington insists the military buildup is aimed at disrupting the flow of narcotics to the United States, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro urged the US against entering another prolonged conflict, asking its people in Spanish: “To unite for the peace of (the Americas). No more endless wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan.”\n \n\n   \n   Asked if he had a message for US President Donald Trump, Maduro replied in English: “Yes peace, yes peace.”\n \n\n   \n  He did not directly answer whether he was concerned about possible aggression from the US. Instead, he simply replied that he was focused on governing his country with peace.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro was attending a mass rally for Venezuela’s youth, whom he later urged to resist what he described as a threat of invasion from the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past three months, the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the Caribbean alongside more than a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform.”\n \n\n   \n  The build-up, considered the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989, has raised speculation that the US may be preparing for a larger conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US says it has carried out at least  20 strikes  against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing 80 people.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that the Trump administration is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside the South American nation. But the administration has also told Congress in recent days that the US did not have a legal justification that would support strikes within Venezuela, though CNN has reported that officials are considering what such a legal opinion would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela has responded by launching a massive  mobilization  of military personnel as well as militia forces made up of civilians. The units have been carrying out exercises across the country to prepare for any potential threat from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The country also appears to have installed large objects on a key highway that are commonly used to block military vehicles such as tanks. A satellite image captured by Vantor on November 10 shows “hedgehog” anti-vehicle obstacles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, which is the main route into the city from the coast. The obstacles first appeared there over a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, has some 123,000 members. Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-files-house-vote-johnson","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00Z","title":"Johnson shifts strategy on Epstein files vote – as GOP leaders brace for mass defections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has shifted strategy to expedite a vote on a bipartisan bill introduced by Republican Rep.

 House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from  President Donald Trump  and support the bipartisan bill led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — as supporters push for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  Republican sources say there’s a broad cross-section of the conference willing to support the plan — and it will be hard to limit defections.\n \n\n   \n  “No point in waiting,” one House GOP leadership source familiar with the strategy shift told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A House GOP lawmaker said of the speaker’s decision: “If you got to do it, might as well do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie told CNN on Wednesday that his hope is that a veto-proof majority will pressure the Senate to act over Trump’s opposition. It would require two-thirds of the House — or 290 votes if all members are present — for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get less than two-thirds vote when it comes up for a vote, I think it’s an uphill battle,” Massie said. “But if we are somehow able to get two thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president.”\n \n\n   \n  A Senior White House official told CNN that Trump was made aware ahead of time that Johnson was going to expedite the vote, and that the two had spoken about it.\n \n\n   \n  “It was made clear to President Trump, and he understands that this is an inevitable reality,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson sent the House of Representatives home for its August recess early – in part to avoid a  vote  related to the Epstein files. When the House returned in September, top congressional Republicans and White House allies were working  behind the scenes  to prevent the politically charged vote. And there was even a last-ditch effort by the president and his allies on Wednesday  to engage with  two of the Republican women helping the effort move forward before it was too late.\n \n\n   \n  But now, GOP sources told CNN, part of the calculation is that the momentum in the House is unstoppable and the only course of action is to send it over to the Senate to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it out of the House,” another GOP lawmaker in support of the strategy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, Massie and Khanna were expecting it to be weeks before their bill would get a vote on the House floor.\n \n\n   \n  Even after the bipartisan duo secured the 218 signatures needed to move forward on Wednesday, there was still a procedural process that had to play out because the effort did not have the blessing of House Republican leadership to come to the floor sooner.\n \n\n   \n  So when Johnson said Wednesday that he was going to expedite the process and put the bill on the floor next week, many were surprised.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson  said  on Wednesday, adding, “In the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given the ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the panel on Wednesday and top Trump administration officials  met with  GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of the few Republicans who signed onto the effort demanding DOJ release its trove of Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t block the parade, you might as well get ahead of it,” Khanna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  If Massie and Khanna’s bill clears the House, as is now expected, it’s fate in the Senate remains uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-clase-ortiz-plead-not-guilty-gambling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:16:00Z","title":"Cleveland Pitcher Emmanuel Clase Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges Alleging He Rigged Pitches","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase has pleaded not guilty to federal charges alleging he rigged pitches to help gamblers in the Dominican Republic win bets on pitch speed and outcome, with accomplice Luis Ortiz also facing similar charges.

He poses no risk of flight,” Ferrara said as the judge weighed the conditions of Clase’s release. “He intends to stay through this.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Ferrara said Clase maintains his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,” he said in a Wednesday statement.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Georgalis, a lawyer for Ortiz, has also denied the charges, saying payments between his client and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for legal activities.\n \n\n   \n  Clase and Ortiz are each charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery.

    6:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to a court ruling, dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Of those arrested, 615 are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Cummings stated he would allow their release on a $1,500 bond and enrollment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Alternatives to Detention program, which can include electronic monitoring, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered the government to identify the people who are eligible for release by noon Friday and paused deportation proceedings for them until the next business day after their release.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the immediate release of 13 people who were arrested in violation of a consent decree that limits warrantless arrests, specifying they are to be released on their own recognizance without bond or conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The judge further ordered the government to produce by November 19 the names and threat levels of the approximately 3,000 people arrested since June.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented people – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  Challenges remain for those ordered to be released, immigration experts said in response to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested people have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week, finding her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his Customs and Border Protection agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  That news came days after Bovino was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/texas-university-race-gender-topics","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:03:00Z","title":"Texas A&M Professors Now Need Approval for Race and Gender Topics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Texas A&M University System has implemented a policy requiring professors to seek presidential approval before discussing race, gender ideology, sexual orientation, or gender identity in their courses.

The changes come months after a viral video of a student confronting an instructor over her lessons threw the campus into upheaval.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy will apply to all 12 schools within the system, including at Texas A&M, the flagship campus that is one of the largest universities in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy states that no academic course “will advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” unless approved in advance by a campus president.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy appears to be the first time that a public university system in Texas has put in rules on what faculty can talk about in their classroom on the topics of race and gender.\n \n\n   \n  Other university systems in Texas have also placed restrictions on classroom instruction or have begun internal reviews of course offerings following a new state law.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the new policy say it would impede the ability of faculty to teach, undermine academic freedom and could be a violation of First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  “It really strikes at the heart of what education means and what universities do, which is circulate the exchange of knowledge without fear of retaliation, without fear censorship,” Rana Jaleel, chair of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom, said about the A&M system’s new policy.\n \n\n   \n  Various universities and their presidents around the country, including  Harvard ,  Columbia , and the  University of Virginia , have come under increased scrutiny this year from conservative critics and the administration of President Donald Trump over  diversity, equity and inclusion practices  and the schools’ responses to  campus protests. \n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Trump asked nine major universities , including the University of Texas at Austin, to agree to various provisions, including commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman” and to promote conservative views on campus.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy defines “race ideology” as a “concept that attempts to shame a particular race or ethnicity, accuse them of being oppressors in a racial hierarchy or conspiracy” or assigns “them intrinsic guilt based on the actions of their presumed ancestors or relatives.” The policy defines “gender ideology” as a “concept of self-assessed gender identity replacing and disconnected from the biological category of sex.”\n \n\n   \n  “The goal is transparent and document cocurricular review, not policing individual speech,” James Hallmark, vice chancellor for the Texas A&M University System’s Office of Academic Affairs, told the regents.\n \n\n   \n  In approving the policy, regents did not refer to September’s  firing of Melissa McCoul , a senior lecturer in the English department at Texas A&M University, after video was made public in which she argued with a female student over gender identity being taught in a children’s literature class. McCoul’s firing came after political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Gov.  Greg Abbott .\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after McCoul’s termination, Texas A&M’s then president,  Mark A. Welsh III, resigned.  He did not offer a reason for stepping down but he and the school had faced political pressure and criticism, including from Abbott, after the video was posted on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Bright, president of the American Association of University Professors A&M chapter, said he believes McCoul’s case opened the door for the university system to put this policy in place.\n \n\n   \n  “Our job is to teach facts, teach the truth, and if … we have to use a litmus test of whether or not it meets someone’s approval, and it could be quite frankly their political approval, then we have no truth,” Bright, who is a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told the AP ahead of the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  During Thursday’s meeting, eight Texas A&M professors and instructors, including Bright, spoke against the policy, with many calling on regents to rehire McCoul.\n \n\n   \n  Two A&M professors spoke in favor of the policy, including Adam Kolasinski, with the Department of Finance, who said he didn’t believe the policy violated academic freedom and that “academic freedom does not mean you get to teach whatever you want.”\n \n\n   \n  Regent Sam Torn said the policy was being put in place to “make sure we are educating, not advocating.”\n \n\n   \n  A Texas law that forbids Texas K-12 schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity took effect on Sept. 1. The law does not apply to universities and other institutions of higher education.\n \n\n   \n  Texas A&M is located in College Station, about 95 miles (153 kilometers) northwest of Houston.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article reports on an unprecedented surge in politically motivated redistricting across U.S. states in 2025, driven by both Republicans and Democrats as they prepare for the 2026 midterm elections.

The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store.

Neild, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:04 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Remember that time you had too much   cheese, felt a bit queasy and — as a greasy sheen broke out on your forehead — you lied to yourself that it was salad from now on?\n \n\n   \n  Then spare a thought for the heroic judges at this year’s World Cheese Awards, who assembled on Thursday to anoint an aged Swiss Gruyère as the best cheese in the world for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This army of 265 cheese experts from all over the planet was tasked with wading through dairy concoctions of every shape, size, color and consistency in a large auditorium in the Swiss capital Bern. In the space of a couple of hours, each judge plowed their way through at least 40 cheeses — sniffing, stroking, crumbling, and finally, tasting to arrive at a score.\n \n\n   \n  The winner was Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen, a cheese made from cow’s milk at a small dairy in the Alpine lowlands of western Switzerland. “It’s an incredible honor,” said cheesemaker Pius Hitz, shortly after picking up the top prize.\n \n\n   \n  While the win in previous years has resulted in a surge in sales for the champion cheese, Hitz said his herd of red and white Fleckvieh   cows can rest easy. A production increase is unlikely, he said, so as not to disturb the delicate balance of the protected Gruyère market.\n \n\n   \n  Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen may have only traveled a few miles to the awards, but it was still a long journey to the top. More so for its rivals, many of which had to navigate long plane rides, tricky import legislation and the US shutdown even before the contest started.\n \n\n   \n  No fewer than 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries made it to Bern’s Festhalle venue where, as judgment day wore on, they made their presence known with cascades of intensifying odors that collided with sound waves from an ensemble of Swiss horns tooting in the corner of the auditorium.\n \n\n   \n    Soft pools of goo\n \n\n   \n  The cheeses were divided up across 110 rows of white-clothed tables under the scrutiny of two- or three-person judging teams. All wearing matching yellow aprons, they were drawn from the community of makers, mongers and mavens who make up the ranks of the international cheese cognoscenti.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 10 a.m., they began the Herculean labor of trying to find bronze, silver, gold and “super gold” contenders among the milk-based marvels — stripped of identifying features so they can be blind tasted — stretching before them.\n \n\n   \n  Holes were bored in giant waxy wheels, slivers shaved from wedges, spoons dipped into soft pools of goo. In between tastings, palates were cleansed with sips of water, bites of crunchy apples and, in some cases, emergency swigs of Coca-Cola.\n \n\n   \n  There were cow, sheep, buffalo, camel and donkey milk   cheeses. Manchegos, Bries, Camemberts, cheddars, Parmesans, Goudas. Orange cheeses, blue cheeses, green cheeses. Cheeses covered in wax. Cheeses covered in flowers. At least one cheese doused in whiskey and red apple juice.\n \n\n   \n  Some were hard. Some crumbly. Some dense. Some were light and fluffy. Some were so soft they needed to be in jars. Some, their tops cut off to reveal a moist interior glistening with mold, looked as if they might teem with lifeforms as yet unknown to science.\n \n\n   \n  All were awarded points based on appearance, smell, taste, texture and the feeling it gives in the mouth — not always a pleasant experience, apparently.\n \n\n   \n  “There were a couple of no-swallows today,” said Emma Young, a UK cheesemonger and author judging the wares laid out on table 26, pointing out a cheese that she thought might have encountered problems during the making process.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t all bad.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s bonkers,” Young added. “I’ve tasted some of the best cheeses I’ve had in my life — and some of the worst. It’s been so much of a palate workout.” She pointed to a cheese that earned top marks thanks to a “complexity” she put down to the varieties of milk used.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Biting into a cloud’\n \n\n   \n  “If only it tasted as beautiful as it looks,” said Ashley Morton, a judge on table 11, where an unusually bright blue cheese, made using spirulina algae, was attracting camera phones. Morton, a “cheese ambassador” originally from New York who goes by the nickname Brieyoncé, favored a raw goat cheese coated in a gray substance that was “almost like biting into a cloud.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look at the fruit level here,” said Jen Shelton, an organic milk expert originally from Kansas, discussing a large wheel of cheese covered in pressed grapes with fellow table-52 judge Charles Beauquesne, from France. The cheese then scattered onto the table. “It’s very crumbly,” she added. “Milky, but quite dry. The grapes give it a little bit of sweetness, but it’s claggy.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair made a note of the cheese’s score, wiped down their utensils with a paper towel   and moved on to the next candidate.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, many of the judges had made their final selection, carrying “super gold” winners to a separate judging area where a team of seasoned cheese experts pared the field down to 14 finalists. These were then tasted and scored live on stage, like an aromatic “Dancing with the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  The shortlist included a Japanese soft goat’s cheese with a texture like whipped cream, a UK hard cheese the color of a deep sunset, one US cheese and, inevitably, several more Swiss cheeses. It’s widely recognized that entries from the host country have a home advantage — cheeses are not great travelers — but locals don’t always take the crown. A Gruyère won in 2022 when the contest was staged in Wales.\n \n\n   \n  John Farrand, managing director of the event’s organizers, the UK-based Guild of Fine Food, said the World Cheese Awards stand out above other dairy contests around the planet because it can claim to be truly global — staged in different countries and involving such a diverse cast of entrants and judges. In 2026, the contest will move to Córdoba in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  The winning cheese of 2025 was championed by Perry Wakeman, one of the top-level judges who normally is found aging cheese at Rennet & Rind, near Cambridge, England. The Gruyère was a worthy winner, he said, describing its complexity: “Butterscotch, caramel. Savory, some fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal. The length was unbelievable. Three cheeses on, we could still taste it.”\n \n\n   \n  For onlookers, the cheese judging could be a frustrating process. Concerns over foot and mouth disease and other agricultural health problems meant that only judges who’d signed a waiver were permitted to sample the produce under the terms of the contest’s special import license.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the day, the auditorium tables were still groaning with leftover cheese that would sadly never be eaten. The contest organizers said that the remnants don’t completely go to waste, but would be recycled locally and “turned into energy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a 43-day shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — President Donald Trump signed a compromise bill that ended the government closure.

Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:15 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  longest federal government shutdown  in history is over.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump on Wednesday night  signed  the compromise bill that ended the 43-day shutdown soon after the legislation  passed the House .\n \n\n   \n  The  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the bill extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the package, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions will continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The package fully funds the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance. Agriculture Sec. Brooke Rollins  told CNN  that all recipients should see their full funding by Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also replenishes SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund will also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one, though they should receive their  back pay  in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, slammed the inclusion of the measure, saying it would provide millions of dollars to eight senators investigated in a probe around the fake elector scheme from the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson posted on X Wednesday that Republicans lawmakers are introducing a standalone bill to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n    Hemp products ban\n \n\n   \n  The package includes a controversial measure that prevents the unregulated sale of hemp-based or hemp-derived products from being sold online, in gas stations or in corner stores.\n \n\n   \n  The measure does not affect non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.\n \n\n   \n  Hemp, a variety of cannabis, was  legalized  as part of the 2018 Farm Bill.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/alina-habba-office-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00-04:00","title":"Person Ransacks New Jersey Federal Prosecutor’s Office After Being Denied Meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A person attempted to meet with US Attorney Alina Habba at the New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office building but was denied entry initially due to carrying a baseball bat.

House seats \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration moved Thursday to challenge California’s effort to redraw the state’s  congressional maps  ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, throwing the full weight of the Justice Department in the high-stakes battle over control the House of Representatives next year.\n \n\n   \n  After voters in the Golden State approved a ballot measure last week that allows state Democratic lawmakers to replace congressional lines drawn by the state’s independent commission  with new ones  that make five Republican-held US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the California Republican Party and others raced to court to block the redistricting effort.\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s move to join that lawsuit is a dramatic escalation in the legal challenge, which, if successful, could scramble Democrats’ plan to push back against a nationwide effort by Republicans, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to boost the party’s chance of holding on to their House majority through rare, mid-decade redistricting ploys across several states.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the Trump administration told the federal judge overseeing the case in the Central District of California on Thursday that days after the case was brought last week, the “federal interest” in the matter became clear given the constitutional issues and claims of race-based discrimination at stake in the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that the redistricting plan was sold to voters as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  “Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,” the Justice Department lawyers  wrote in court papers . “Because the Proposition 50 map does, the United States respectfully requests that this court enjoin defendants from using it in the 2026 election and future elections.”\n \n\n   \n  “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,” said Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, cast California’s plan as a “brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process.”\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    64% of voters backed Newsom plan\n \n\n   \n  Democrats argued the measure, Proposition 50, was necessary to counter Texas’ new congressional map, which Republicans redrew in a bid to gain five seats at Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  While Texas Republicans were able to draw new lines with legislation, California Democrats needed voters to pass a constitutional amendment to temporarily override the state’s non-partisan independent redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  Over  64% of voters  approved the plan.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats significantly outraised and outspent Republicans in the state. Newsom became the face of the measure, arguing that Democrats needed to “fight fire with fire” to prevent the president from skewing the 2026 midterm election map. Other key surrogates, including former President Barack Obama, joined the effort, which Democrats see as key to their chances of retaking the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not usual for the federal government to get involved in election-related cases. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department had its hands in litigation over state efforts to purge voter rolls and certain restrictive voting measures enacted in GOP-led states.\n \n\n   \n  The California case hasn’t developed much since it was brought last week. Newsom and the other stare officials named as defendants have yet to file responses to the allegations and the judge randomly assigned to the case has not scheduled any major court hearings. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been allowed to join the case to defend the redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n    Trump has backed pro-GOP efforts\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s decision to  join the California lawsuit  is noteworthy given Trump’s call for Republicans state lawmakers to redraw their maps ahead of next fall’s elections to help the very thin GOP majority in the House.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department’s involvement in the California effort is not the first time this year that it has inserted itself into the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  In July, as attention was turning to Texas’ congressional maps, a top DOJ official sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton that raised “serious concerns” about the “legality” of four districts in the state.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ official, Harmeet Dhillon, urged the state to “rectify” the issues or risk legal action from the department. The following month, several of the districts flagged by Dhillon were impacted by the state’s redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/takeaways-lindsey-halligan-comey-james-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:55:00-05:00","title":"Pointed questions and gasps in courtroom: Takeaways from hearing on fate of Trump’s handpicked prosecutor Lindsey Halligan","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a courtroom hearing on November 13, 2025, attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James challenged the Justice Department over the legality of appointing Lindsey Halligan, a White House adviser, as interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Halligan \n       \n  By Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn  Polantz, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:55 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James battled the Justice Department in court Thursday over whether President Donald Trump lawfully appointed a prosecutor to go after his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  The two cases suffer from “a fundamental defect,” Comey’s attorney, Ephraim McDowell began the hearing, arguing that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan for the Eastern District of Virginia brought his client’s case before a grand jury alone despite having “no authority to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, then a White House adviser, was appointed after the previous interim US Attorney for the district was pressured to pursue indictments against the two, who Trump repeatedly has attacked and demanded be charged.\n \n\n   \n  One lawyer for the Justice Department, Henry Whitaker, argued Thursday that Comey and James were trying to “elevate what is at best a paperwork error.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey is charged with making a false statement to Congress and James with bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    The limit does not exist, DOJ argues\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of Thursday’s dispute is whether the 120-day limit imposed for interim US attorneys is truly a limit or a guidance for when the attorney general needs to reassess their selection.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorneys argue that following the limit, an interim appointee must be confirmed by the Senate or have their appointment extended by the judges of the district they serve.\n \n\n   \n  If Halligan can be appointed as the head prosecutor of the Alexandria, Virginia, office despite the limit on individuals serving in the job on an interim basis, McDowell argued, then that guardrail is useless.\n \n\n   \n  Her appointment, he said, acted as an “evasion of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued Thursday that the “government’s reading” of the federal law at issue requires the judge “to add words” to it.\n \n\n   \n  The underlying statute, Whitaker said, doesn’t say the attorney general can only “cram multiple appointments” in one, 120-day period, but instead can continue to select and re-evaluate.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not argue that the attorney general,” Whitaker continued, has a “fire and forget” authority. “The idea that we are going to try to evade Senate confirmation,” is “fanciful.”\n \n\n   \n     US v Trump  \n \n\n   \n  The Judge presiding over the issue of Halligan’s appointment, Cameron McGowan Currie, pressed Whitaker Thursday on whether the government believed the classified documents case in Florida against Donald Trump was incorrectly dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in that case,  Aileen Cannon,  found that then-special counsel Jack Smith was wrongly appointed in part because the Senate had not confirmed him to the role.\n \n\n   \n  The question drew gasps from the audience in the courtroom and came toward the tail end of the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker proceeded to walk a tight legal rope by arguing that Smith would not have even met the qualifications for a US Attorney and enjoyed “unique and broad” powers as a special counsel.\n \n\n   \n  “You wouldn’t have appointed Jack Smith” as a US attorney, Whitaker said, adding that “the attorney general has full authority” to appoint those who qualify.\n \n\n   \n     Missing time  \n \n\n   \n  Currie also laid into Whitaker during the hearing on whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had reviewed the grand jury transcript in James Comey’s case, noting there was no record of anything that happened after 4:28pm ET that day. Comey wasn’t indicted for nearly two hours after that, according to available court transcripts.\n \n\n   \n  “It became obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the entire proceeding, Currie said, adding that it appeared “there was no court reporter present” at the time of the missing portion.\n \n\n   \n  In preparation for Thursday’s hearing, Currie privately reviewed the transcripts and said previously that she thought looking at the transcripts was “necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN following the hearing, a representative for the Justice Department denied that there was anything missing from the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no ‘missing two hours.’ That time period refers to when the jurors were deliberating behind closed doors, which would not be included in a transcription,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ, however, did not offer an explanation for the gap in court.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said she would issue a decision over Halligan’s appointment before Thanksgiving, with both trials currently set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/20th-strike-us-military-boats-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:58:00Z","title":"US military carried out 20th strike on alleged drug boats, killing 4, official says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted its 20th strike on an alleged drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing four people, bringing the total number of fatalities to 80.

Caribbean and four narco-terrorists were killed, no survivors,” the official confirmed in a statement to CNN. Trump administration officials  have acknowledged  they do not necessarily know the identities of the individuals aboard the vessels before they are targeted.\n \n\n   \n  The strike occurred on Monday, the official said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously announced two Sunday strikes, the 18th and 19th conducted by the US military, on two vessels each with three people aboard. Hegseth said in a post on X the following day that those strikes killed all six. The 20th strike was first reported   by CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  The attack   brings the total number of people killed by the US military’s strikes on the alleged drug boats to 80. CNN  has reported  that the military is using a variety of fighter jets, drones, and gunships to carry out the strikes in the campaign officials say is meant to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has  told Congress  the administration does not need its approval to carry out the strikes, which some experts have said could violate US and international law. The ongoing campaign has also begun to surface tensions with allies; the United Kingdom has stopped sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels to avoid being complicit in the strikes,  CNN reported this week , which the UK believes are illegal. The president of Colombia also said this week that he had ordered his country to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the attacks stop.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/donald-trump-epstein-political-danger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:56:00Z","title":"The Political Danger of the Epstein Files for Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes how Donald Trump’s association with Jeffrey Epstein—reflected in newly released emails from 2011 and 2019—has created political suspicion, even in the absence of formal charges.

(The White House said the emails “prove absolutely nothing.”)\n \n\n   \n  In one of those emails from 2011, Epstein expressed surprise to accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump’s name hadn’t surfaced amid accusations involving Epstein. Epstein added that Trump had at one point spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2019, Epstein appeared to signal Trump was quite aware of Maxwell recruiting girls from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 2000s, saying “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  While some have claimed these emails show Trump had knowledge of or even involvement in Epstein’s crimes, it’s not nearly so evident. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has acknowledged meeting Trump and never accused him of wrongdoing. And Trump has acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees including Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. (The big question there is whether Trump had any inkling about what Maxwell was recruiting a minor female like Giuffre  for .)\n \n\n   \n  But also notable on Wednesday was Trump’s reaction.\n \n\n   \n  As all this was going down, he and his White House seemed preoccupied with what appeared to an  11th-hour campaign to thwart  a House discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing the full Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  With the petition due to get a decisive 218th signature when a new Democratic member of Congress was sworn in later that day, the White House held a meeting in the Situation Room with a key GOP lawmaker who’d signed on, while another said she was playing phone tag with the president. Both GOP congresswomen later told CNN Trump hadn’t personally lobbied them to remove their names. But the president also  publicly pressured  Republicans who sided with Democrats on forcing Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  It was a weird move, to be sure. No Republicans removed their names from the petition, and Speaker Mike Johnson quickly said he would schedule a vote for next week on compelling the Justice Department to release the full files.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the measure passes in the House, that’s not the end of the story. The GOP-led Senate would still have to take it up, and Trump would still have to sign it. So it’s not like this will cause the imminent release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s resistance to something his base has long clamored for – and the optics of the Situation Room meeting in particular – would only seem to deepen the huge suspicions that a large number of Americans already harbor about the government covering up Epstein-related matters.\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at the big point here – and the political danger for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  This is merely the latest baffling episode in the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. Among  the others :\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump doesn’t have anything to hide, the danger here is in making it look a whole lot like he does.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are primed to believe there’s a real conspiracy beneath the surface, and Trump’s actions risk making him own it.\n \n\n   \n  The polling tells the tale.\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps Trump’s worst issue, by the margin who disapprove. Americans generally disapprove of his and the administration’s handling of the Epstein matter by around a 3-to-1 margin in most polls. The most recent poll, a Reuters-Ipsos survey from last month, showed Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of it 57%-19%. Independents disapproved 59%-10%.\n \n\n   \n  And like virtually every other survey on the topic, not even a majority of Republicans said they approved: 44%.\n \n\n   \n  Americans are also quite unhappy with the administration’s transparency and disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  An August  Pew Research Center survey  showed 63% of Americans and even 38% of Republican-leaning Americans had little or no trust in what the Trump administration was saying about the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, an  August Quinnipiac University poll  showed voters said 73%-16% that the Justice Department wasn’t being transparent about its investigation.\n \n\n   \n  All of that said, this is clearly not a top-tier issue for most Americans. Relatively few have seemed to be paying close attention. Only about one-quarter were following it “extremely” or “very” closely in the  Pew survey .\n \n\n   \n  But crucially, it’s also something Americans are liable to believe the worst about.\n \n\n   \n  To wit:\n \n\n   \n  That same poll showed even 33% of Republicans said Trump hadn’t gone far enough to get to the bottom of Epstein matters.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, only 26% of Americans and just 55% of Republicans were willing to rule out that Trump had engaged in crime with Epstein. (Trump hasn’t been charged with any crimes related to Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s a lot of Americans who are inclined to believe the worst here – or are at least willing to entertain it. People also seem to have very little confidence and trust in what the administration is doing or saying about all of this.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s conduct just keeps giving them reason to be suspicious.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/health/covid-vaccine-federal-recommendations-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00Z","title":"Conflicting advice on Covid shots likely to ding already low vaccine rates, experts warn","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Covid vaccine uptake in the U.S. has declined significantly, with only 23% of adults vaccinated during the 2024–25 season, despite ongoing public health risks.

About 75% of Americans had received  at least one dose  of the first versions of the vaccine by early 2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. But only about 23% of American adults got a covid shot during the 2024-25 virus season, well below the 47% of American adults who got a flu shot. The vaccination rates for  flu ,  measles , and tetanus are also going down.\n \n\n   \n  Yet covid remains a serious, potentially deadly health risk, listed as the primary cause of death on roughly 31,400 death certificates last year. By comparison, flu killed  about 6,500  people and pneumonia, a common complication of the flu, killed  an additional 41,600 ,  CDC data shows .\n \n\n   \n  As millions of Americans decide whether to get a covid shot this season, public health researchers worry vaccination rates will slide further, especially because Hispanic and Black Americans and those under 30 have lower rates, exposing them to serious complications such as long covid. Under the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the federal government has narrowed its recommendations on the covid vaccine, leading to a hodgepodge of rules on pharmacy access, with Americans living in Republican states often facing more barriers to getting a shot.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of misinformation is going around regarding covid,” said  Alein Haro-Ramos , an assistant professor of health, society, and behavior at the University of California-Irvine. “Vaccine hesitancy is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Food and Drug Administration  narrowed approval  for covid vaccines to those 65 or older and to adults and children with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for serious complications from covid.\n \n\n   \n  A month later, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  voted to recommend  “shared clinical decision-making” on the vaccine, pulling back from advising all adults to get vaccinated. The committee advised doctors to emphasize to adults under 65 and children that the benefits of the vaccine are greatest for those with underlying health conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance is rebutted by infectious disease experts who say most adults and children should get both the flu and covid vaccines, which are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. Several independent medical organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have reiterated their support for broad adoption of covid vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen states have taken steps to ensure most people can get a covid shot at the pharmacy without a prescription, with many states tying their policies to the advice given by medical organizations. And many of those states require insurers to cover vaccines at no cost, according to  a KFF analysis . In several other states, predominantly Republican, pharmacy access to vaccines may require a prescription.\n \n\n   \n  Among the most commonly cited reasons for covid vaccine hesitation are fears about side effects, long-term health consequences, the effectiveness of the vaccine, and mistrust of pharmaceutical corporations and government officials, according to  a 2024 review  of multiple studies, published in the journal Vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Covid vaccine hesitancy in the 2024-25 virus season was higher among Latinos; African Americans; men; uninsured people; and people living in Republican-leaning states, CDC data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Latino adults were significantly less likely than adults from most other racial and ethnic groups to get a covid shot last season, with a vaccination rate around 15%.\n \n\n   \n  Some of that may be due to age: A  disproportionate share  of Latinos are young. But public policy actions may also be a factor. The first Trump administration, for example, tied Medicaid to “public charge,” a rule allowing the federal government to deny an immigrant a green card or visa based on their dependence on taxpayer-funded programs. Some Latinos may be afraid to sign up for social services even after the Biden administration reversed those first-term Trump actions.\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos co-authored  a study  published in 2024 that found many Latinos were hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears about their immigration status, and that experiencing health discrimination like care denials or delays increased their vaccine hesitancy.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you trust the health care system, broadly speaking? Do you want to provide your information — your name, your address?” Haro-Ramos said. “Trust is critical.”\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos said the problem has likely worsened since her study was published. The Trump administration  revealed this summer  that it would give the personal information of Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many Latinos are  canceling doctor appointments  to head off possible confrontation with immigration enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  “People are avoiding leaving their homes at all costs,” Haro-Ramos said.\n \n\n   \n   Janani Rajbhandari-Thapa , an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, recently  co-authored a study  of covid vaccination among nearly 1,500 African Americans living in south Georgia. The study found that participants were more likely to listen to their health care providers than faith leaders or co-workers when seeking advice on getting vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of those studied had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but those who were unvaccinated were more likely to agree with false statements that tied vaccines to miscarriages, components’ remaining in the body for a long time, or even to the conspiracy that they implant a computer chip in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the clinicians who can take the messages about vaccination — that these are myths,” Rajbhandari-Thapa said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though covid hospitalization and death rates have fallen dramatically since the worst days of the pandemic, fatal complications related to covid remain most common among older people.  Around 89%  of U.S. covid deaths last year were among people 65 and older, compared with  about 81%  of flu and pneumonia deaths.\n \n\n   \n  As the pandemic falls into the rearview, young people have developed a sense of invincibility. Only 11% of Americans 18 to 29 received a vaccine during the 2024-25 virus season, the lowest vaccination rate among adult age groups. That’s far below the  70% of young adults  who got at least one dose of the initial covid vaccines by November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  While many people get covid after receiving a covid shot, because the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection wears off pretty fast, some misunderstand the purpose of the shot, said  Otto Yang , an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health.\n \n\n   \n  “They think, ‘Well, the vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting covid, so the vaccine didn’t work,’” Yang said. “And what they’re not seeing is that the vaccine prevented them from getting severely ill, which is ultimately the most important thing.”\n \n\n   \n  And the vaccine can help prevent long covid, which is a problem for all ages, Yang said. A recent Northwestern University study  found that  younger adults suffer worse symptoms of long covid than older adults.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Yang said, it is not a consistent choice to get a flu vaccine but forgo a covid vaccine, since both are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. It is clear, he added, that people with compromised immune systems and those at higher risk should get a covid shot. The decision is “a little bit less clear” for others but “probably most adults should be getting vaccinated, just like it’s recommended for the flu vaccine, as well as most children.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/venezuela-military-us-tensions-explainer-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"How Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era military stacks up against US forces in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the growing US military presence in the Caribbean, particularly with the arrival of the USS Gerald R.

Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The buildup of US naval forces in the Caribbean, boosted by the recent arrival near Latin America of the  USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier , has raised speculation that both the United States and Venezuela may be  preparing for a larger conflict. \n \n\n   \n  While the US has characterized the buildup as aimed at combating drug trafficking, some experts have questioned why so much firepower is needed if the sole aim is targeting drug boats. They note that the ship’s arrival marks the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself – described as the US Navy’s “ most lethal combat platform ” – the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the region alongside more than a dozen warships – including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship and amphibious assault vessels – and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  That sort of firepower brings into sharp relief what experts characterize as the aging Soviet-era equipment Venezuela would be relying on if US President Donald Trump  were to decide  on military action inside the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the forces at Caracas’ disposal:\n \n\n   \n    A tough, but aging, Soviet image\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), has built a reputation over the past two decades as a regional military power a cut above most of its neighbors in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that image was forged through the sustained acquisition of Russian equipment under Maduro’s predecessor, the late President Hugo Chávez, a former professional soldier who owed his ascent to power to the revolutionary movement he founded within the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  After Chávez became president in 1999 (seven years after he organized a failed military coup), he funneled the country’s massive oil resources into the military, buying Russian equipment due to an informal US embargo and placing military men in key government positions.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, weapons systems such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 battle tanks, S-300, Pechora and Buk anti-aircraft missiles, portable Igla-S systems and Kalashnikov rifles – all designed in Soviet times, have come to define the FANB’s image. The arsenal distinguishes the Venezuelan forces from other militaries in the region, which tend to rely more heavily on US or European weaponry (though Venezuela still has some aging US-designed equipment from pre-Chávez days).\n \n\n   \n    A paper tiger?\n \n\n   \n  The problem for Venezuela is that while on paper it has a relatively well-equipped military, question marks hang over the maintenance of its equipment and the training of its personnel – not least because the country has suffered more than a decade of economic hardship, one of the world’s  highest rates of inflation  and a drop in oil production, all made worse by US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Partly due to this economic collapse, about 7.9 million Venezuelans – many of them young people of military service age – have left the country, according to UN data.\n \n\n   \n  Though the government “recently resumed modest maintenance and modernization efforts,” according to a 2024 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), years of underinvestment have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  “The FANB has a rather low level of operational capability and asset availability, partly because they’ve been through more than a decade of economic crisis in the country,” Andrei Serbin Pont, an analyst specializing in defense at the CRIES think tank, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Military and militia: In numbers\n \n\n   \n  Currently, the FANB has about 123,000 active personnel. The army  has 63,000, the navy 25,500, the air force 11,500 and the national guard 23,000, according to the IISS. These are supplemented by about 8,000 reservists.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to its regular military units, Venezuela can call on the Bolivarian Militia – a reserve force made up of civilians. It was created by Chávez and named after Simon Bolívar, the revolutionary who secured the independence of numerous Latin American countries from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  However, the true size of the militia is opaque. Prior to the recent US buildup, the IISS estimated its number at 220,000, but in August Maduro claimed he would deploy 4.5 million militiamen in response. Weeks later, he said he expected to call up a total of 8.2 million – though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of their training.\n \n\n   \n    Army: Loyal, but top heavy?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower:  With its 63,000 members, Venezuela’s ground forces account for the greatest chunk of its active personnel. They also have the longest history and are most politically aligned with the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Chávez, both the current interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, passed through the army – and Padrino is still an active four-star general.\n \n\n   \n  One indicator of how entwined the government and army have become is the unusual number of generals and admirals, with promotions being doled out for political loyalty. In 2019, that number was estimated at about 2,000 by Adm. Craig Faller, then chief of the US Southern Command, in a speech to the US Congress. “More than in all of NATO,” he pointed out. (In comparison, in 2025, the US had  about 850  for an armed forces 10 times larger).\n \n\n   \n  “Ecuador is a convent, Colombia is a university, and Venezuela is a barracks,” goes an old saying, attributed to Bolívar, that sums up the relationship of Venezuelans with the army.\n \n\n   \n   Weaponry:  Notable systems bought from Russia in recent years include 92 T-72B1 tanks – similar to those being used in Ukraine – and 123 BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, which equip the armored brigades alongside 81 AMX-30 tanks previously acquired from France, according to the IISS. Artillery systems include the Russian Msta-S self-propelled howitzer and Smerch rocket launchers.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿Led by:  The operational strategic commander of all of Venezuela’s armed forces is Domingo Antonio Hernández Lárez. His brother, Maj. Gen. Johan Alexander Hernández Lárez, is in charge of the army.\n \n\n   \n    Air Force: High standard\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  With 11,500 members, the Bolivarian Military Aviation, or air force, is the smallest of the country’s forces but takes pride of place due to the acquisition of Russian equipment that has set it apart among regional competitors in the Caribbean and most of Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  At the center of this arsenal are Sukhoi Su-30MK2s, high-performance twin-engine fighters that, even though developed in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, are unmatched in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-September, the FANB  shared videos  of two of its Su-30s armed with Kh-31 anti-ship missiles, also Russian-made, in a show of what remains its most advanced weapons system.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is thought to have had 24 of these planes at one point, but at least three have crashed, according to the IISS. The Venezuelan NGO Control Ciudadano says the accidents highlight “problems of system obsolescence and of maintenance and lack of spare parts.”\n \n\n   \n  The Su-30s coexist with a few old US F-16 fighters that Venezuela bought before Chávez came to power.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela also has Russian-built air defenses that include 12 batteries of long-range S-300 missiles; nine Buk systems and 44 Pechora units, both medium-range; and numerous portable Igla-S launchers, according to the IISS.\n \n\n   \n  These defenses, while advanced, would likely be the first targets of an opponent if a conflict were to break out, said Serbin Pont, the CRIES analyst.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Maj. Gen. Lenín Lorenzo Ramírez Villasmil.\n \n\n   \n    Navy: Weak point?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  The Bolivarian Navy, whose 25,500 members are tasked primarily with operations in the Caribbean, has lagged the other services in terms of arms purchases in recent decades.\n \n\n   \n  It currently operates only one Mariscal Sucre-class frigate (manufactured in Italy) and one Type-209 submarine (manufactured in Germany) in its sea fleet, according to the IISS. It also has nine oceanic and coastal patrol vessels, including four purchased from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  “The navy lost many of its assets that it had prior to (Chavez), and these were not fully replaced. The corvettes bought from Spain were never equipped with weaponry, until a few years ago when Chilean and Iranian anti-ship missiles were installed, but they do not have viable anti-aircraft defense systems,” said Serbin Pont.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Adm. Ashraf Suleimán Gutiérrez.\n \n\n   \n    And the militias?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Maduro has repeatedly played up the role of the Bolivarian Militia, formed in 2008 by Chavez to provide a loyal paramilitary force that, while technically part of the armed forces, comes directly under the control of the president.\n \n\n   \n  A definitive account of how many people belong to the Bolivarian Militia, an umbrella term for various groups that range widely in experience and ability, is hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  Days after news of the US naval deployment broke, Maduro said in August he was going to “activate … more than 4.5 million militiamen” taken from “all the factories and workplaces of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Missiles and rifles for the working class, so that they may defend our homeland,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He later suggested that the militia has more than 8 million members.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the discrepancies in number, Serbin Pont said that while there were some traditional militias composed of reservists with military experience, most of the groups showcased by the government on television and social media were too inexperienced to play a decisive fighting role.\n \n\n   \n  “Those people do not have sufficient training. There is no real armed structure to mobilize those elements, and those elements would not be effective in combat,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Their real use, Serbin Pont suggested, was serving “as an intelligence network and a repressive threat against the civilian population precisely because they are based on a network that penetrates the whole of society.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00-05:00","title":"Wall Street has its worst day in a month as traders dial back expectations for Fed rate cuts","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street suffered its worst day in a month on November 13, 2025, as investors sold technology stocks and volatility surged due to uncertainty over delayed economic data from the government shutdown.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US stocks closed sharply lower Thursday as investors sold shares in technology companies and volatility picked up on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow fell 798 points, or 1.65%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.66% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.29%.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also assessed how long it might take for economic data releases to be rebooted after the  end of the government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The House on Wednesday evening approved a funding measure that had been passed by the Senate. The bill was signed by President Donald Trump in the late evening, officially ending the longest US government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  Now Wall Street is focused on the  backlog of government data  that was delayed because of the shutdown — and how it might impact the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Lacking fresh economic data, markets have become increasingly jittery in recent weeks,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note. “Now, as the government shutdown ends, each long-awaited data release or policy announcement will have the potential to move markets dramatically.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq each had their worst day since October 10, when a flare up in  US-China trade tensions  sent stocks lower.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Fear and Greed index  moved from “fear” into “extreme fear.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 18% as volatility picked up.\n \n\n   \n  “The gears of the government should be working again soon, and while that is a relief for markets and the economy, there is still plenty of uncertainty, particularly around the missed inflation and jobs data and how these fronts have been faring,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Traders on Thursday were pricing in roughly a 52% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 63% chance on Wednesday and a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The data blackout has made the Federal Reserve’s job difficult, but we still expect them to cut interest rates again in December,” Schleif said. “We expect markets to grind higher — though likely with continued volatility.”\n \n\n   \n  The sell-off in stocks worsened in the afternoon. The third-quarter earnings season is also winding down, meaning there are fewer fundamental catalysts, and markets are more susceptible to moves based on investor sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Tech woes continue\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors have voiced concerns about relatively expensive valuations. There has been rising skepticism about whether AI companies will be able to produce enough profits to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla shares ( TSLA ) fell 6.6%. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) fell 6.5%, and Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 3.6%. Oracle shares ( ORCL ) fell 4.15%.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are reevaluating the prices they’re paying for big tech and AI stocks,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong tech rally in recent months, investors have been taking profits and rotating into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq has dropped nearly 5% since closing at a record high on October 29. The tech-heavy index has shed almost $2 trillion in market value across that time period.\n \n\n   \n  Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he recently trimmed some of his exposure to tech.\n \n\n   \n  “It just had such a monstrous run that it just made sense to take the profits and find other opportunities,” Samana said.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow’s Thursday decline comes after back-to-back days of record highs. The blue-chip index closed above 48,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors moved into sectors including financials and health care.\n \n\n   \n  Walt Disney shares ( DIS ) fell 7.8% on Thursday after the company reported earnings that did not impress Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, bitcoin fell roughly 3.3% on Thursday and traded around $98,250.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington took to the floor to launch the process of sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire — which meant that his hand-picked successor was the only person registered to run for his seat.\n \n\n   \n  Gluesenkamp Perez announced on the floor that she intends to force a vote to condemn García for the move, accusing him of “undermining the process of a free and fair election.” She is using special procedural powers — known as privilege — that mean her resolution is likely to get a vote on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement after her floor speech, Gluesenkamp Perez said García is attempting to “anoint an heir.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences. Americans bled and died to secure the right to elect their leaders. We can’t expect to be taken seriously in the fight for free and fair elections if we turn a blind eye to election denial on our side of the aisle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The move by the Washington Democrat shocked her own party. Multiple members told CNN that their party — including leadership — had no idea it was coming. Some were angry, insisting that Gluesenkamp Perez was going after García at an already fragile moment for the Democratic party, which was splintered over the ending of the 43-day government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But some Democrats have also called out García for the timing of his decision not to seek reelection in a way that effectively meant no other candidate could enter the race. That includes Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey — who succeeded former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was forced out of Congress because of a corruption scandal.\n \n\n   \n  “Rep Chuy García’s decision to end his re-election at the last second and plant his chief of staff as the only candidate to succeed him was undemocratic and should not be allowed. Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim  posted on X  after Gluesenkamp Perez announced her petition on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  García announced on November 4 that he would not run again for his House seat, citing the health of his wife, the death of his daughter in 2023 and his formal adoption of his grandchild just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, filed petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections to run for the seat that same day, just ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline for filing. But the congressman had already planned not to run, according to a report by  the Chicago Sun-Times.  (Patty Garcia has no relation to the congressman.)\n \n\n   \n  The congressman addressed the criticism  in an interview  with a local Illinois political publication, Capitol Fax, saying “I think I followed the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  As for his decision, García said many in his family were “begging” him not to run again after the adoption of his grandchild and his daughter’s death two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Those were just really big factors in me deciding that I could not, in good conscience, do it again, and decided in Washington one of those nights that the only recourse we had was to look at an option. And that’s when I thought that we could try to get my chief, Patty Garcia, on the ballot,” García told Capitol Fax.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN for comment, García’s office referred to a statement in which he said he “followed every rule and every filing requirement laid out by the State of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “Congressman García made a deeply personal decision based on his health, his wife’s worsening condition and his responsibility to the grandchildren he is raising after the death of his daughter,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  And some of his colleagues have defended the congressman.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois  called  García an “an unwavering fighter for our democracy and our communities,” in response to the move to sanction him.\n \n\n   \n  “It is disappointing that someone willing to compromise working families’ healthcare would use this moment for a cheap political stunt aimed at distracting people from an indefensible vote on tonight’s CR,” she said, referring to the fact that Gluesenkamp Perez  voted in favor of the bill  to reopen the government, which did not include an extension of expiring health care subsidies – a key demand from Democrats in the funding fight.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/28/entertainment/holiday-movies-bingo-game","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00-05:00","title":"Holiday Movie Bingo: A Peaceful Thanksgiving Game for Families","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes 'holiday movie bingo' as a fun, non-controversial game for Thanksgiving gatherings, using celebrity references like Drew Barrymore and Lacey Chabert to add cultural appeal.

By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Artificial intelligence is playing a greater role in everything from homework to jobs and even romantic companionship — all without much oversight to guarantee the tech is being developed and used safely.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a pair of state attorneys general are teaming up with two of the biggest companies in tech to change that.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, and Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, a Republican, announced on Monday the formation of the AI Task Force. OpenAI and Microsoft have already signed on to the effort, and the attorneys general expect other state regulators and AI companies to join, too. The group will work to develop “basic safeguards” that AI developers should implement to prevent harm to users, especially children, and to identify new risks as the technology develops.\n \n\n   \n  There is no overarching federal law regulating AI, and some federal lawmakers have even sought to restrict regulation of the technology. Jackson and Brown were among the 40 attorneys general who earlier this year successfully  pushed for the removal  of an  AI regulation moratorium  from Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cuts package that could have blocked enforcement of state laws for a decade. (One federal AI law did pass this year: the  Take It Down Act , which specifically cracks down on non-consensual deepfake pornography.)\n \n\n   \n  Concerns about AI safety risks have only escalated in recent months, amid a growing  string of reports  about the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Facebook-parent Meta have also been scrambling to block young people from accessing adult content.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said he’s not hopeful Congress will move quickly to regulate AI.\n \n\n   \n  “They did nothing with respect to social media, nothing with respect for internet privacy, not even for kids, and they came very close to moving in the wrong direction on AI by handcuffing states from doing anything real,” Jackson told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of the task force announcement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the leading AI companies have begun to diverge in their approaches to safety. For example, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  said last month  that the company’s investments in child safety protections would enable it to “treat adults like adults,” including allowing verified adult users to engage in erotic conversations. Shortly after, Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  told CNN  his company would not allow sexual or romantic conversations, even for adults, and that he wanted to make “an AI you trust your kids to use” without a separate, young user experience.\n \n\n   \n  “This effort reflects a shared commitment to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while working collaboratively with stakeholders to understand and mitigate unintended consequences,” Kia Floyd, Microsoft’s general manager of state government affairs, said in a statement on joining the task force. “By partnering with state leaders and industry peers, we can promote innovation and consumer protection to ensure AI serves the public good.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever guardrails the task force develops will technically be voluntary. But the group will have another benefit, too: bringing states’ top law enforcement officers together to track AI developments and risks, potentially making it easier for them to take joint legal action if tech companies harm consumers. That makes this effort different from “a group of think tanks coming together” to create AI safety principles, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson would still like Congress to pass more AI legislation. But, he said, “Congress has left a vacuum and I think it makes sense for AGs to try to fill it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/trump-administration-designates-european-antifa-groups-terrorists","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Trump administration designates four European Antifa groups as terrorists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has designated four European Antifa groups—Antifa Ost (Germany), Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI), Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice (both in Greece)—as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, placing them in the same category as extremist groups like ISIS-K and al-Shabaab.

terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday he was classifying four groups in Germany, Italy, and Greece as Specially Designated Global Terrorists and intends to designate them as foreign terrorist organizations effective next week.\n \n\n   \n  The designations put the groups – Antifa Ost, Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI), Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice – in the same category with groups like ISIS-K and al-Shabaab.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes  amid a push  by President Donald Trump to target the Antifa movement, which often leans to the political left and lacks centralized structure or defined leadership.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump signed an order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and directing federal agencies to take action against it.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio on Thursday accused Antifa groups of ascribing to “revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, ‘anti-capitalism,’ and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas.”\n \n\n   \n  According to a State Department fact sheet, Germany-based Antifa Ost conducted attacks on individuals it deemed as “fascists” in Germany between 2018 and 2023 “and is accused of having conducted a series of attacks in Budapest in mid-February 2023.” It was designated as a terrorist organization in Hungary earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “FAI/FRI has claimed responsibility for threats of violence, bombs, and letter bombs against political and economic institutions, including a courthouse and other ‘capitalist institutions,’” the State Department fact sheet said.\n \n\n   \n  The fact sheet said Revolutionary Class Self-Defense had “claimed responsibility for two IED attacks targeting the Greece Ministry of Labor (February 3, 2024) and the Hellenic Train offices (April 11, 2025),” and that Armed Proletarian Justice “claimed responsibility for planting a bomb near the Greek riot police headquarters in Goudi, Greece on December 18, 2023.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result of the designations, any assets in the US from the groups will be blocked, and Americans are prohibited from “knowingly” providing material support to them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

said a statue of the Virgin Mary cried tears of blood and claimed she could multiply gnocchi for her followers, has been charged with fraud, along with her husband. They are due to stand trial in April.\n \n\n   \n  For years, faithful Catholic pilgrims flocked to a field outside Rome, belonging to Gisella Cardia – born Maria Giuseppa Scarpulla – and her husband Gianni Cardia, to pray in front of the statue of the Madonna of Trevignano. The statue was said to weep blood and transmit messages Gisella Cardia claimed were both from God and Satan, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who have been denounced by the Vatican, created a shrine to the Madonna statuette and regularly held prayer events, during which Gisella Cardia would take to the stage and preach.\n \n\n   \n  Her followers have told media that, although Gisella Cardia did not multiply bread and loaves, she would often show up with one box of pizza or a plate of gnocchi that somehow multiplied to feed the masses.\n \n\n   \n  The couple also collected nearly €400,000 ($465,000) between 2018 and 2024 from those who came to pray in front of the statue, promising that the money would go to children’s hospital, the prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia, which has charged them with fraud, confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor’s office has alleged that the money was used to spruce up the pilgrimage site and for a $40,000 car, and was not taxed in accordance with religious donations.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who will face trial in April, are accused of staging “apparitions” to make it seem that blood was flowing from the Madonna statue’s eyes for money.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged scam came to light in 2023 after a former follower contacted police. In an interview with state broadcaster RAI, he said he told officers that he’d found a coffin in his car following an alleged confrontation with Gisella Cardia.\n \n\n   \n  Police launched an investigation, testing the blood which turned out to match Gisella Cardia’s DNA, geneticist Emiliano Giardina of the public prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia said in a court report.\n \n\n   \n  At that time,  the Vatican  released a statement warning pilgrims to be wary of “the alleged apparitions and revelations reported by Mrs. Gisella Cardia… and by Mr. Gianni Cardia,” which it said had been judged to be  not supernatural .\n \n\n   \n  The couple’s lawyer Solange Marchignoli told CNN Thursday: “(Gisella) Cardia is relieved, as she believes this moment represents an opportunity to transparently reveal the truth of the facts and to definitively put an end to all forms of speculation, misunderstanding, and controversy that have, despite herself, involved her in recent months.” Marchignoli added that the couple “welcomed the trial and said it would be a necessary step to finally clarify, in the appropriate venues, every aspect of the case involving her.”\n \n\n   \n  One woman told a local news channel in an interview later broadcast by RAI that she witnessed Gisella Cardia multiplying pizza.\n \n\n   \n  “We were at her house for a rosary, and there were about 20 or 25 of us. After the rosary, we decided to stay there for a while to talk. At one point, someone brought a box of pizza. A person near us cut it and each of us went over there and took a little piece at a time… We all ate it. The pizza was never ending and this is all the work of Divine Providence through Gisella,” the woman said.\n \n\n   \n  Gisella Cardia herself also recounted a similar instance in an interview with La Repubblica newspaper when allegations of into fraud first surfaced in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “There was lunch left over, consisting of gnocchi and a bit of rabbit,” she said. “Everyone ate the gnocchi and rabbit, 15 people, and it’s incredible.

limits get a bump up \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:20 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you plan to max out your contributions to your 401(k) or IRA next year, you will get to save a little more than you could this year.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS on Thursday announced cost-of-living adjustments to federal contribution limits for 2026 for key retirement savings vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  401(k) participants will be allowed to   put away up to $24,500 next year, a $1,000 increase from the current limit. The same increase will apply to 403(b)s, governmental 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone 50 or older in those plans can save more. Next year the so-called “catch-up contribution” limit rises to $8,000 from $7,500, for a total of $32,500. But those who are ages 60, 61, 62, and 63 may save even more – up to an additional $11,250, which is the same limit as this year, for a total of $35,750.\n \n\n   \n  There is another change, however, for the highest-earning older savers. Starting in 2026, if in the prior year you made more than $145,000 in FICA wages — that is income subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes — any catch-up contributions you make will  automatically be subject to income tax . So they essentially will be treated as  Roth 401(k)  contributions.\n \n\n   \n    New savings and income limits for traditional and Roth IRAs\n \n\n   \n  If you are eligible to put money into a tax-deductible IRA or an after- tax Roth IRA, you will be allowed to save up to $7,500, which is $500 more than you can sock away this year.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit if you’re at least 50 will be $1,100, up from $1,000 today.\n \n\n   \n  The income thresholds to determine whether you’re eligible to save in those IRA vehicles are also being adjusted.\n \n\n   \n  Those thresholds differ based both on your marital status and whether or not you’re covered by a retirement savings plan at work. (Here are the IRS’ new  income threshold breakdowns  across those categories.)\n \n\n   \n    Limits for Saver’s Credit and SIMPLE Accounts also change\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a low- or moderate-income worker, you may be eligible for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, also known as the  Saver’s Credit . It’s essentially a government-provided match on at least a portion of your retirement contributions to an IRA or workplace retirement plan.

Kevin Stitt has spared the life of a death row inmate just before he was set to receive a lethal injection on Thursday, commuting the man’s sentence to life in prison without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt formally granted clemency to Tremane Wood, 46, who was scheduled to die for the stabbing death of a man during a botched robbery in 2002. It is just the second time the Republican governor has granted clemency during his nearly seven years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation to commute Tremane Wood’s sentence to life without parole,” Stitt announced.\n \n\n   \n  “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” the governor said.\n \n\n   \n  In his executive order commuting Wood’s sentence, Stitt says Wood shall not be eligible to apply for or be considered for a commutation, pardon or parole for the rest of his life.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt previously granted clemency to  death row inmate Julius Jones  in 2021, but had rejected clemency recommendations in four other cases. A total of 16 men have been executed during Stitt’s time in office.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment with the governor’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I am disappointed that the governor has granted clemency for this dangerous murderer, but respect that this was his decision to make,” Drummond said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Wood was scheduled to die for his role in the killing of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farmworker from Montana, during an attempted robbery at a north Oklahoma City hotel early on New Year’s Day in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves, said she and her legal team are “profoundly grateful” for Stitt’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace,” her statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Wipf grew up in a Hutterite religious community in Montana, and his family and the surviving victim of the attack supported his clemency, Castro Alves said.\n \n\n   \n  George Burnett, one of the original prosecutors, said he’s concerned that a five-member parole board can have such a profound impact on a case that has been litigated for more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “Ronnie Wipf is buried on a lonely hill somewhere on the plains of Montana, and when his family visits him, they wonder what might have been,” Burnett said.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma’s Pardon and Parole Board  voted 3-2 last week  to recommend that the governor grant clemency.\n \n\n   \n  During the clemency hearing, Wood’s attorneys didn’t deny that he participated in the robbery but maintained that his brother, Zjaiton Wood, was the one who actually stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood was sentenced to life without parole. Before he died in prison in 2019, he admitted to several people that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.\n \n\n   \n  Castro Alves told the panel Tremane Wood had an ineffective trial attorney who was drinking heavily at the time and who did little work on the case. She also said trial prosecutors improperly concealed from jurors the benefits that witnesses received in exchange for their testimony. Wood’s attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution on these grounds, but were denied.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while in prison, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering attacks on other inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Wood, who testified to the panel via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but denied being the one who killed Wipf.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a monster. I’m not a killer. I never was and I never have been,” Wood said.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorneys also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution, but the court denied that request early Thursday. His attorneys had argued, among other things, that trial prosecutors didn’t properly reveal details of a plea agreement with a key witness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:35:00-20:35","title":"Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 80","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military conducted 21 strikes between September 2 and November 10, 2025, killing 80 people and destroying 21 boats, under the Trump administration's claim of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels.

have destroyed 21 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory.

prison release date set for 2028 \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wagmeister, Josh Campbell, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:04 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sean “Diddy” Combs will be staying in prison at least one month longer than he thought.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Prisons pushed Combs’ release date to June 4, 2028, according to the agency’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ original release date – first reported in October, more than three months after a jury delivered a mixed verdict in his federal trial – had been scheduled for May 8, 2028.\n \n\n   \n  No explanation was given by the Bureau of Prisons for the pushed back date  and representatives couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The change could reflect an updated calculation or punishment if an infraction, if any, occurred.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ spokesman Juda Engelmayer told CNN they have not been given an explanation for the changed date yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still trying to find out what the dates mean and why and what the issue is, if there is one” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs was accepted into the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program, known as RDAP, at the low security prison in Fort Dix, NJ. Inmates who participate in the program often receive credits that can reduce time from their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “His only goal is he wants to work on himself, do better, be better, and get back to his family and be the father that they need. He’s not going to do anything to hurt that,” Engelmayer said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs had been sentenced to 50 months (roughly more than four years) by a judge after a two-month trial ended with him being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs was acquitted by a jury of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering for which he was facing decades and possibly life in prison if convicted.\n \n\n   \n  He has already served 13 months in jail and that will be credited to his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  He had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest. In late  October , Combs was transferred on Thursday to  Fort Dix , a low-security federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is appealing his conviction and sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ defense previously told CNN that they had approached President Donald Trump’s administration about a potential pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ attorney Nicole Westmoreland  told CNN  in August that it was her “understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon.” At the time, a White House official told CNN they “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any clemency request.”\n \n\n   \n  In October after Combs’ sentencing, Trump confirmed that Combs had requested a presidential pardon in connection with his federal criminal case,  telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins  “a lot of people have asked me for pardons,” including Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously indicated that he was unlikely to pardon Combs during an  interview  with Newsmax, saying, “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.” Trump said that this made pardoning Combs “more difficult to do.”\n \n\n   \n  During his trial, Combs’ defense admitted to his pattern of violent behavior against women with whom he was in romantic relationships over the years. The jury was repeatedly shown footage — first published in 2024 by CNN — of Combs violently beating his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016. The jury was also shown images of bloody gashes and bruises on Ventura’s body during trial.\n \n\n   \n  Ventura was the star witness of the case and testified that she was repeatedly abused by Combs and forced to take drugs and have sex with other men against her will throughout their 10-year relationship, during which he controlled her career and finances. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” also recounted psychological, financial and physical abuse by Combs who she said forced her to have sex with other men while she was under the influence of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  At his sentencing, judge Arun Submaranian  admonished Combs  for his abuse and rejected the defense’s “attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate consensual experiences or just a sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll story.” Submaranian said that the prosecution’s case “showed that (Combs) abused the power and control (he) had over the women (he) professed to love dearly.”\n \n\n   \n  “You abused them physically, emotionally and psychologically and you used that abuse to get your way,” he said, addressing Combs. “This was subjugation, and it drove both Ms. Ventura and Jane to thoughts of ending their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs is also facing roughly 70 civil lawsuits where most of the dozens of accusers — some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged incidents — claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs has denied all of the civil claims. Some of the lawsuits have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.

Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doctors at NYU Langone Health say two new studies show that they are a significant step closer to making kidney transplants from other species a real option in the near future.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have been searching for years for an alternative to human transplants because the donor supply cannot keep up with demand, particularly where kidneys are concerned.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90,000 people in the US are waiting for a kidney transplant, and about 11 of them die every day,  according to UNOS , the nonprofit that manages the nation’s organ donation system. But with an aging population and the rise in conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, the need will only grow.\n \n\n   \n  Dialysis can keep a person with end-stage kidney disease alive, but the process can be hard on the body and  can typically  sustain someone for only about five years, on average.\n \n\n   \n  In the search for an alternative, scientists have been turning to cross-species organ transplants, called xenotransplantation.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest hurdles they have to overcome is the body’s tendency to reject an organ transplant. New studies published Thursday in the journal Nature offer more information on how to prevent the body from rejecting the pig kidney, and the researchers say they think they’ve had a breakthrough in understanding how the immune system handles these kinds of transplants.\n \n\n   \n    The rejection issue\n \n\n   \n  The human immune system protects the body from threats like fungus or bacteria, but it can sometimes be a little overprotective.\n \n\n   \n  The immune system cannot distinguish between a bad foreign object that enters the body, like a virus, and a good one, like a donor organ. When either is introduced, the immune system goes into full protection mode, sending antibodies to attack whatever it identifies as the problem. Those antibodies can damage the donor organ and ultimately make a transplant fail.\n \n\n   \n  Even with human-to-human transplants, rejection is a big concern. For the rest of their lives, recipients must take powerful anti-rejection drugs that suppress the immune system. When the donor is a pig, scientists also genetically alter the organ to make it more compatible with the human body.\n \n\n   \n  The new studies aimed to take the closest look possible at how the human body rejects a pig organ.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at NYU transplanted an organ from a genetically modified pig into a person who was brain-dead: Maurice Miller, 57, who died from a mass in his brain in July 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors said Miller had always wanted to donate his organs but could not do so because he had cancer. Instead, they asked Miller’s family if they would donate his entire body to research.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers thought an organ transplant into a brain-dead person would allow them to test tissue samples and blood in ways that would be too intrusive with a living recipient or even with a non-human primate, said study co-author Dr. Robert Montgomery, chief of the New York University Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “This decedent might be the most highly studied human in history,” Montgomery said of Miller.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors removed Miller’s own kidneys and transplanted a genetically modified kidney from a specially bred pig from the biotech company Revivicor. Miller’s body was kept alive on a ventilator in the ICU for two months. During that time, doctors biopsied the kidney regularly, monitored his blood and tested other tissue samples.\n \n\n   \n  There were two episodes in which Miller’s body tried to reject the pig kidney, but for the first time in history of xenotransplantation, Montgomery said, they had success with   available rejection medication, and the organ continued to function. They stopped the experiment at day 61.\n \n\n   \n  This part of the work, Montgomery explained, would help doctors better understand what immunosuppressive medications would work best in other people who receive pig organs.\n \n\n   \n  “It also will give us a sense of relief moving forward in the clinical trials that we’re in the middle of right now, to know that when you put a pig kidney in a human, from a physiological standpoint, it just does its thing,” Montgomery said. “The kidney is capable of doing most of the things that a human kidney can do, and the things that it doesn’t, we either have redundancy and we don’t necessarily need it, or there’s a few drugs that we need to supplement. But other than that, we’re good to go.”\n \n\n   \n  The new research, he said, “brings us measurably closer to safe pig-to-human organ transplants.”\n \n\n   \n    Creating a detailed map\n \n\n   \n  During the episodes in which Miller’s body started to reject the organ, the doctors were able to create a detailed map of exactly how his immune system reacted to the pig organ and identify the pathways the body was using to reject it. They also were able to map out the genomics associated with those pathways, mapping 5,100 expressed pig and human genes and pinpointing every immune cell in the body to track immune behavior at this uniquely granular level.\n \n\n   \n  “We really were able to tease apart what happened on a nearly daily basis,” said study co-author Dr Brendan Keating, a member of the faculty in the Department of Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  They could also see   the differences in immune reaction to a pig organ versus what happens with a transplanted human organ.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers said they identified biomarkers in the blood that eventually may be used to detect organ rejection much earlier, before damage could be done.\n \n\n   \n  Although the study is a major step forward, Montgomery said, it involved just one person, so the findings will need to be replicated in others to see whether the reactions are consistent. The researchers just got funding to test immune suppression techniques in 20 additional patients, he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We’re getting better at this’\n \n\n   \n  In the past year alone, scientist have made enormous progress in understanding how pig kidney transplants work.\n \n\n   \n  The most notable success involved the case of Tim Andrews of New Hampshire, the fourth living person in the US to get a kidney from a genetically modified pig.\n \n\n   \n  Andrews set a record when his pig kidney continued to function ﻿for 271 days.  Doctors had to remove  the organ at the end of October, after they noticed a decline in function. But before that point, the transplant had worked so well that Andrews was able to take long walks and even throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game.\n \n\n   \n  The kind of research found in the new studies is important for the field, said Dr. Minnie Sarwal, co-director of the Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program at the University of California San Francisco.   \n \n\n   \n  “Sixty-one days of stable renal function is novel proof of concept, and I think it confirms that genetically engineered pig kidneys can sustain physiological function in human circulation,” said Sarwal, who was not involved with the new research. “As a first step, proof of concept, clearly, is very important, because it is bridging the gap between what we were previously worked working on with short lived preclinical models, and we are able to go to true clinical feasibility, even though it’s obviously not long-term. But 61 days is better than, let’s say, hours, or maybe a few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Sarwal, who focuses on therapeutic innovations for immunosuppression drug design, said the new studies also demonstrated that rejection was treatable.\n \n\n   \n  “That part’s not groundbreaking, but I think it’s very comforting that our current treatments would work in that model, which we expected they would, but confirmation is great to see,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Mapping immune reaction may give researchers other “druggable molecular checkpoints” so they can develop better immunosuppression options for transplant recipients, Sarwal said.\n \n\n   \n  Montgomery thinks his experiment can also give hope that xenotransplantation will be a more viable option someday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting better and better at this, and I think that’s the message that I would like to deliver,” Montgomery said. “There’s going to be ups and downs. Nothing worth doing isn’t fraught with some complications.”\n \n\n   \n  But, he added, “it’s all solveable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/gorsuch-children-book-declaration-of-independence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00-04:00","title":"Justice Gorsuch to co-author children’s book about the Declaration of Independence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Justice Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Supreme Court has announced he will co-author a children’s book titled 'Heroes of 1776: The Story of The Declaration of Independence' with Janie Nitze, set for release in May 2026 to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

Justice Gorsuch to co-author children’s book about the Declaration of Independence \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Justice Neil Gorsuch said Thursday he will co-author a children’s book next year focused on the Declaration of Independence, a departure from the headier book the conservative jurist authored last year that  targeted burdensome government  regulations.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be titled “Heroes of 1776: The Story of The Declaration of Independence” and is set to publish in May, which Gorsuch indicated is timed to correspond to the 250th anniversary of the document’s signing.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the next year we’ll celebrate a lot of dates and events with fireworks and   I wanted to share with children some stories about the courage and sacrifice of the heroes behind 1776 who gave us our Constitution and our liberties,” Gorsuch told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be published by HarperCollins.\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch, who was President Donald Trump’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, published a decidedly adult book just last year that lamented out-of-control government bureaucracies and told the stories of Americans he said had been hampered by overzealous regulations and red tape.\n \n\n   \n  In that book, Gorsuch told the story a commercial fisherman in Florida who was threatened with a 20-year prison sentence for tossing undersized grouper overboard – a case that was decided by  the Supreme Court  in 2015. He also wrote about Marty Hahne, a Missouri magician who became a  cause célèbre for anti-regulation advocates   a decade ago when the US Department of Agriculture required him to draft an emergency disaster plan for Casey, a rabbit he pulled out of a hat at his shows.\n \n\n   \n  In June,  Gorsuch reported receiving a little over $250,000 in book royalties  – a roughly equal amount to what he reported a year before. Supreme Court justices, who earn more than $300,000 a year, are barred from receiving more than about $30,000 in outside income annually. But book revenue is exempt from that policy, creating an incentive for the nine to put pen to paper beyond their opinions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, has authored several children’s books, including one this year. Sotomayor reported nearly $134,000 in book-related income in her most recent financial disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett both zigzagged across the country this fall promoting new books.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh is working on book now. So is Justice  Samuel Alito .\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch is writing the book with Janie Nitze, who also co-authored Gorsuch’s book last year. It will be illustrated by Chris Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  In a promotional statement, HarperCollins said the new book would “dive into the stories of ordinary people willing to do extraordinary things” around the time of nation’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to know our shared history, and I think if we do that we’ll come to realize that all the things that separate us pale in comparison to the things that unite us,” Gorsuch told Fox. “I wanted to be part of America’s celebration and bringing us together again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/europe/ukraine-zelensky-energy-corruption-scandal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-13:00","title":"Energy Scandal Spells Trouble for Zelensky as Ukrainians Face Another Winter of Power Cuts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is under growing political and public pressure due to a major corruption scandal involving energy sector contractors.

Ukraine’s ability to withstand the  Russian campaign , and carefully ration its power supplies, served only to cement its leader Volodymyr Zelensky’s credibility at home.\n \n\n   \n  Three years on, the picture is rather more difficult. Ukraine’s president finds himself under fire over a burgeoning energy sector corruption scandal, while his people face a fourth tough winter, with power cuts and heating outages as severe as ever.\n \n\n   \n  On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces find themselves losing ground across the east, most critically in the one-time  logistics hub of Pokrovsk , as key Western allies appear to be focused elsewhere. The war may still be Ukraine’s overriding priority, but corruption is likely Zelensky’s most immediate concern.\n \n\n   \n  The scandal, which centers on alleged kickbacks from contractors including those working to protect critical energy infrastructure, has already taken down two of Zelensky’s ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the government announced it was suspending German Galushchenko, the justice minister, who previously served as energy minister. Galushchenko said he would defend himself in the face of the allegations. Both he and his successor as energy minister have since submitted their resignations at Zelensky’s urging; swift parliamentary approval is expected.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Ukraine’s anti-corruption body announced it had carried out searches on dozens of properties – including one linked to Galushchenko – as part of an investigation into the alleged kickbacks.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said about $100 million had been siphoned off – between 10-15% of the value of the contracts – as state-owned businesses including Energoatom, which operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, paid companies for work done to enhance security at key sites.\n \n\n   \n  That the latest corruption scandal involves the energy sector gives it a particular edge. People in Kyiv are currently without electricity for eight to 11 hours per day, a result of Russia’s improved ability to strike  power plants and substations .\n \n\n   \n  Diesel generators, purchased during the first blackouts three years ago, have reappeared outside shops and cafes. Candlelit dinners have again become part of the daily routine.\n \n\n   \n  The blackouts can also mean heating is off, lifts in high-rise buildings do not work, and water supply is interrupted. The situation is usually worse in towns and cities outside the capital.\n \n\n   \n     Zelensky name-checked in court \n \n\n   \n  Court hearings on the investigation – live streamed on the public broadcaster’s website – have been underway in Kyiv since Tuesday and look set to continue for at least the next few days. They include snippets of what investigators say are 1,000 hours of recorded conversations between the suspects in the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a potentially damaging first, one of the conversations released Wednesday name-checked Zelensky himself. In a transcript read out in court, the man accused of masterminding the corruption scheme, Timur Mindich, appeared to suggest he had influence over the president, boasting to Galushchenko of his success in getting Zelensky to call the then-energy minister on the phone and invite him for a meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript contained no details of that alleged call, and Zelensky has made no comment. It is believed to be the first time his name has been mentioned, albeit indirectly, in a corruption case in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is Mindich himself, perhaps the most awkward element in all this as far as Ukraine’s leader is concerned.\n \n\n   \n  Given the codename Carlson by his alleged co-conspirators, Mindich is a former business partner of Zelensky, dating back to his previous career as a highly successful entertainer and producer.\n \n\n   \n  Mindich himself has made no comment on the accusations against him and has left the country, Ukraine’s state border agency said in a statement late Wednesday. The agency noted he had left legally, adding they had not received an order to stop him. Zelensky’s cabinet has now introduced sanctions on Mindich, which include a block on his business interests and bank accounts.\n \n\n   \n     Defeating Russia and tackling corruption \n \n\n   \n  Corruption allegations are nothing new in Ukraine. During the first months of Moscow’s full scale invasion, there was an unwritten understanding among Ukraine’s journalists and civil society that corruption investigations were not a priority. Defeating Russia was the only thing that mattered.\n \n\n   \n  That consensus began to decay after about a year. Since 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) has opened investigations into a series of scandals, including an illegal land development project involving a deputy prime minister and the embezzlement of public funds allocated to pay for soldiers’ food.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Zelensky has managed to avoid getting dragged into the scandals, though Ukrainians put him on notice in the summer with large anti-government protests – the biggest since the full scale invasion – after he approved a parliamentary move to neuter NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office. He backed down under pressure from key international allies, who have made anti-corruption an important plank of their long-term support for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister under Zelensky and now head of the Kyiv School of Economics, told CNN the president had to “act as harshly as possible” if he wanted to maintain popular support among Ukrainians. “(People) say, ‘Let’s see how he acts… if he’s not acting, then he’s with them (the accused). We’ll know if he’s acting… but if he really sanctions them, arrests them, prosecutes those who allow this to happen, then, okay, he’s good.’”\n \n\n   \n  Until Tuesday, Mylovanov was a member of the supervisory board of Energoatom, before resigning his position over what he said was the failure of company executives to act rapidly on the scandal, though he blamed the foot-dragging on cluelessness rather than corruption.\n \n\n   \n  It is too soon to assess whether this corruption scandal will cause any lasting  damage to Zelensky’s support among Ukrainians. Recent polling conducted by  the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, albeit before the latest allegations, shows popular levels of trust in the Ukrainian leader remaining at around 60% – down on the figures for earlier this year, but consistent with the levels enjoyed in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Tolerance of corruption has declined over the same period, though not dramatically.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hunder, who leads the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said it was essential that those who were stealing from the state were held fully accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a critical moment for Ukraine’s leadership to show that its commitment to integrity and accountability is unwavering,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mylovanov took a more pessimistic view of how the corruption scandal would likely play with the Trump administration, regardless of how Zelensky acts.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if they care or not,” he said. “But they will use it as a leverage point over Zelensky.”\n \n\n   \n   Victoria Butenko and Svitlana Vlasova contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/how-to-help-food-insecurity-iyw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"09:26:00-05:00","title":"How to Help Those Facing Food Insecurity","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After the end of a government shutdown, millions of Americans are still facing food insecurity due to delayed SNAP benefits.

CNN has reached out to Andrew for comment following the latest release of material from the House committee.\n \n\n   \n  In what appears to be a separate email chain between the former Duke of York and Maxwell on the same day, discussing a response to the press enquiry from the Mail on Sunday newspaper, he wrote: “Hey there! What’s all this? I don’t know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can’t take any more of this.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew sent his messages after he was forwarded a right-to-reply email by Epstein from the newspaper, in which, he featured in several claims. The email alleged that a woman, whose name has been redacted in the released documents, worked as a masseuse for Epstein and met and had sex with Andrew at Maxwell’s London home in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  It alleged that the masseuse met Andrew again at Epstein’s New York residence where she and another girl were directed by Maxwell to sit on his knee, and he groped them before Maxwell directed the girls to have sex with him.\n \n\n   \n  It also alleged that the woman was later directed to stage an orgy for Andrew and Epstein on the financier’s private Caribbean island, Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  The emails appear to be referring to the claims of Virginia Giuffre, who has spoken extensively about her years of being sexually trafficked, allegedly at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein who  died by suicide  in April, repeatedly claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew while underage on three occasions – in London, New York and on Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  She alleged that third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein’s island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English,” as detailed in her posthumous memoir.\n \n\n   \n  She claimed that the-then prince  was aware  she was underage in the US when they were introduced.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew told the BBC in a television interview in 2019.  He said in the same sit-down that visiting Epstein in 2010  was the “wrong decision”  and that he regretted acting in a manner that was “unbecoming.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein confirms Andrew photo\n \n\n   \n  In another email exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein also appeared to discuss Giuffre and the now infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then-17-year-old. The now former royal has repeatedly said that he has  no recollection of the photograph  being taken and has suggested the image could be fake.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The disgraced financier also appeared to ask the journalist to investigate Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  “I never misled you, this girl is a total liar,” Epstein wrote in the email.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe your paper should jump on and show that (redacted)’s allegations re andrew (sic) are the same, she also accused numnerous (sic) people of having sex with her,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew reached an  out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, after  Giuffre’s memoir  reignited public attention on Andrew’s links to Epstein, he was officially  stripped of his titles  in an extraordinary move by his brother, King Charles III.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee  requested Andrew answer questions  as part of the panel’s investigation into Epstein and his accomplices. Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC that he has not responded yet to the committee’s invitation to testify.\n \n\n   \n    Mandelson in contact with Epstein until 2016, emails show\n \n\n   \n  The new cache of documents from the House committee also seem to shed further light on the extent of the contact between Epstein and Peter Mandelson, who was  recently fired  as British ambassador to the United States over his ties to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein’s birthday two weeks earlier. “63 years old. You made it,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that “you were right about staying away from Andrew.”\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson responds, “Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly what the two men are referring to. CNN has attempted to reach out to Mandelson for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson was fired as Britain’s ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship.\n \n\n   \n  Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson’s ties to Epstein were known prior to his appointment to the post in Washington in 2024. But the September emails sparked a crisis for Britain’s Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with many questioning why he appointed Mandelson despite concerns about his past.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Foreign Office told CNN at the time that the emails showed that “the depth and extent” of the now-ex-ambassador’s relationship with Epstein is “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  Following his dismissal two months ago, Mandelson said in a letter to embassy staff reported by the BBC that he continued “to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/holiday-travel-spirit-airlines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Flying Will Stay Rough After the Shutdown. Why? Spirit Airlines","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Spirit Airlines, once a major force in keeping domestic airline fares low through aggressive discount pricing, has significantly reduced its flight schedule due to financial distress and bankruptcy reorganization. With nearly 11,000 fewer flights scheduled during the holiday season compared to last year — a one-third reduction — its competitive pressure on larger carriers like American, Delta, and United has weakened. This reduction is directly contributing to a 6% price increase over Thanksgiving and a 7% rise during the holiday period. Although Spirit remains operational, its diminished presence and route cuts mean it no longer exerts the same downward pressure on airline pricing, which benefits the larger carriers and leads to higher consumer costs.

Why? Spirit Airlines \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Relatively few people fly Spirit Airlines – but the company could still affect how much you pay for your holiday travel, even if recent government-mandated flight cancellations end.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Spirit has had an outsized effect on fares across the industry. The discount carrier’s rock-bottom fares forced much larger carriers, such as American, Delta and United Airlines, to keep their prices lower. That includes offering lower-priced seats at the back of planes, often on the same no-frills basis as Spirit.\n \n\n   \n  But Spirit, facing severe financial hardship, is now a fraction of the size it was just a year ago. That is impacting fares this holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  Even if flight cancellations because of the government shutdown are restored, there will be nearly 11,000 fewer Spirit flights this holiday season compared to last year, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium analyzed by CNN. That includes the period six days before Thanksgiving through the Sunday after New Year’s Day. The drop represents a one-third reduction in Spirit’s schedule, or a loss of nearly 2 million available seats.\n \n\n   \n  US domestic flights are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site Going.com.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I can’t pinpoint that and say all of that is attributable to Spirit,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for Going.com. “But it definitely is contributing to the higher prices we’re seeing.”\n \n\n   \n  Like most other low-cost carriers, Spirit has continually lost money since 2020, when the pandemic hit. Now in the midst of its  second bankruptcy reorganization,  the company once again warned investors on Tuesday there was “ substantial doubt ” over its ability to stay in business over the next 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Spirit is shuttering immediately. But the airline has been slashing flights in a desperate effort to stem losses, offering far fewer routes.\n \n\n   \n  The routes of virtually every US airline now have less overlap with Spirit than before, Raymond James airlines analyst Savanthi Syth said in a note to clients this week.   And with Spirit flying on fewer routes, the carrier won’t put nearly as much downward pressure on the fares of larger airlines.\n \n\n   \n  In August, when Spirit  first warned investors  about possibly being forced out of business, Spirit CEO Dave Davis told   employees the airline remained “critical” for flyers.\n \n\n   \n  “We have saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, whether they fly with us or not,” he wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/middleeast/west-bank-settler-violence-arson-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:39:00-05:00","title":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launched a violent arson attack in the West Bank, specifically targeting the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory in Beit Lid, east of Tulkarm.

Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge \n       \n  By Zeena Saifi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:39 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of  Israeli  settlers launched an arson attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian economy ministry on Wednesday called on the international community to take action to stop the attacks. In Tuesday’s incident, perpetrators set fire to four trucks loaded with products from Al-Juneidi, and smashed windows and other property, it said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Anarchist fringe youth’\n \n\n   \n  A senior official from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) condemned the violence. “The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious,” Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth said in a statement shared by the IDF on Wednesday. “It must be dealt with firmly.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued it was unacceptable for “lawbreakers” to “harm property and innocent civilians” while diverting the IDF’s focus “away from its mission of security and counterterrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/nfl-week-11-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-05:00","title":"5 Things to Watch in the NFL’s Week 11: Spain Debut, Revenge Games, MVP Race, and a Mega Showdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NFL is making history by hosting its first regular-season game in Spain, with the Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders playing in Madrid at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

Here are the 5 things to watch in the NFL’s Week 11 \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:30 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The NFL’s passport is getting another stamp, but the drama back home is just as intense.\n \n\n   \n   From revenge games to division battles, here are five things to know heading into Week 11.\n \n\n   \n    NFL heads to Spain\n \n\n   \n  For the first time ever, the NFL is headed to the Spanish capital.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders will square off in Madrid in the league’s first regular-season game in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The historic matchup will take place at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, home of Real Madrid, and will close out this year’s international slate. Spain becomes the seventh country outside the United States to host an NFL regular-season game, joining Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil and Ireland.\n \n\n   \n  So set those alarms early on Sunday – kickoff from Madrid is at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n    Falcons out for revenge\n \n\n   \n  The Atlanta Falcons will have extra motivation Sunday when they host the Carolina Panthers. The last time these two met in Week 3, Carolina rolled to a 30-0 win.\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta has dropped four straight and sits at 3-6. The offense has been brutal, converting just three third downs in its last three games – 3 for 29 in that span. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will need to steady the ship if the Falcons hope to stop the slide.\n \n\n   \n  The good news? Their next three opponents – Panthers, Saints and Jets – are all beatable.\n \n\n   \n    Stafford’s MVP case\n \n\n   \n  Matthew Stafford is on a tear. The Los Angeles Rams quarterback is rewriting the record book, becoming the first in NFL history to throw 20 touchdown passes without an interception over a six-game stretch.\n \n\n   \n  In his last three outings alone, Stafford has tossed 13 touchdowns. He’s now tied with New England’s Drake Maye as a favorite for league MVP.\n \n\n   \n  Another milestone: By beating the 49ers last week, Stafford’s career record finally hit .500 at 115-115-1. After all those rough years in Detroit, that’s no small feat. A win Sunday against the 7-2 Seahawks would give him a winning record for the first time – and first place in the NFC West.\n \n\n   \n     More Mile High Magic? \n \n\n   \n  Every week, the Denver Broncos seem to pull another rabbit out of the hat.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payton’s team has punted more than any team in the league, yet they have won a league-high seven straight and sits atop the AFC West at 8-2.\n \n\n   \n  During this streak, Denver’s margin for error has been razor-thin – wins by 4, 3 (twice), 2 and 1 point.\n \n\n   \n  At some point, the one-score magic runs out… or maybe this team just has it.\n \n\n   \n  But this week’s test is different: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs visit Mile High.

Now he has an affordability problem \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump says he is going to \"make America affordable again.\" It's a pledge he made frequently during the campaign. And now, after dropping it from his lexicon for more than eight months, he's saying it again as polls show voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concern and  blame Trump's policies  for making things worse. A senior administration official tells NPR Trump will soon travel around the country with a message that while some things have improved, there is more work to do to help people feeling economic strain. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, added that when it comes to affordability, \"there's no finish line.\" Thus far, Trump has spent far more time boasting about how great the economy and stock market are doing than acknowledging any economic anxiety. \"Record high, record high, record high,\" Trump said of the stock market last week at a business event in Florida. \"Costs are way down,\" Trump said at a late night signing ceremony in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"My administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy and make America affordable again for all Americans.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's affordability challenge marks a dramatic reversal of fortune for a president who returned to office on a promise to bring costs down and whose greatest political strength was on the economy. Now his approval rating on the economy is severely underwater. After sweeping wins by Democrats in last week's elections where the cost-of-living was a key issue, Trump suddenly had a lot to say about \"affordability.\" But he has frequently come across as dismissive and defensive. \"The affordability is much better with the Republicans,\" Trump said last week. \"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.\" But earlier this week when Fox News' Laura Ingraham pressed Trump on rising costs of things like coffee and ground beef, he called it a \"con job by the Democrats.\" Asked why people are anxious about the economy, Trump responded by questioning whether people really are saying that. \"I think polls are fake,\" Trump said. \"We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To support his positive outlook, Trump points to the booming stock market, his tariff policy and pledges by companies and countries to invest in the U.S. Inflation this year has been persistent but not dramatic, at about 3%. Eggs have gotten cheaper since Trump took office, but other staples like ground beef and coffee are up. According to  Gas Buddy , the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $3.09 per gallon, slightly higher than this time last year. \"Consumer confidence is the lowest it's ever been,\" said Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard. \"People are really negative about inflation.\" It's a political truth — and a pitfall for presidents — that people don't want to hear that everything is awesome if they are struggling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Furman, who served in the Obama administration, says the messaging team in that White House was very cautious not to brag about the economy, as the nation emerged from the Great Recession. \"Because they thought anything we said positive about the economy risked people thinking President Obama was out of touch,\" said Furman. \"I didn't see that type of reserve when Biden was president. He bragged about it quite a lot, and I think that [rang] hollow with a lot of people. And President Trump is even less reserved about his bragging.\" Trump's insistence that the economy is great earned him a rebuke from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Appearing on  the Sean Spicer Show on YouTube , Greene said she gives Trump credit for holding inflation steady. \"But that doesn't bring prices down,\" said Greene. \"And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping. It's actually infuriating people because people know what they are paying at the grocery store, they know what they're paying for their kid's clothes and school supplies. They know what they're paying for their electricity bills.\" She called for compassion rather than lecturing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says there are three major cost issues that have to be addressed: grocery prices, home prices and health care costs. \"It is true factually that the average family has more purchasing power today than they did when Biden left office,\" said Moore. \"And yet people don't feel it. You know, they're not feeling the love. And I can't explain why that is except that people tend to focus on things where their prices are rising.\" In fact, purchasing power also grew during the Biden administration, because wages rose faster than costs. But voters didn't want to hear it then, and they are in no mood to hear it now. \"People are kind of in a crabby mood right now when it comes to the economy,\" said Moore. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607041","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-05:00","title":"Scientists pull ancient RNA from a woolly mammoth's body","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a groundbreaking discovery published in the journal Cell, scientists led by paleogeneticist Love Dalén from Stockholm University successfully extracted and analyzed ancient RNA from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth named Yuka, found in Siberian permafrost.

It doesn't look like it died yesterday, but you can't believe your eyes because it's so well preserved. It's a kind of holy hell moment when you see this.\" The animal had been found thawing out of a permafrost cliff near the Siberian coastline — not quite the entire body of a juvenile mammoth that lived during the last Ice Age some 39,000 years ago. It had remained buried and frozen for millennia. Now, in a paper published in the journal  Cell , Dalén and his colleagues report that they managed to extract something remarkable from that ancient mammoth — RNA, the molecule that translates genes into proteins and which tends to degrade rapidly. The results offer a glimpse into what was happening inside this ancient mammoth's cells when it died. The molecules that maketh a mammoth The Russians named the animal — which they believed to be a female based on visual inspection — Yuka. \"It does have deep scratch marks on its hindquarters,\" says Dalén. \"It either was attacked by cave lions while it was alive, probably chasing it down, or maybe cave lions were scavenging on it after it had died.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over the years, various researchers had studied and sequenced Yuka's DNA, \"which is kind of a recipe for how to make a mammoth,\" explains Dalén. (That DNA contains genes, which carry instructions for building specific proteins.) But he and his collaborators wondered about the mammoth's  RNA  — the flurry of little messenger molecules that translate that recipe into the building and operating of an actual mammoth. \"The RNA molecules instruct the cells how and when to make proteins,\" says Dalén. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most every cell in an organism's body has the same DNA. And yet — depending on where they are and what they do in the body — those cells can look and behave differently from one another. \"What makes these cells different is the RNA activity in them, which genes are turned on and off,\" he says. \"That is what separates liver cells from muscle cells and so on.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The whole set of RNAs contained in a cell at a given time point is very much dynamic [and] can also quickly change in response to many factors, like stress, daytime, feeding, sleep, contaminants, infections, etc,\" says  Emilio Mármol Sánchez , a geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen. Dalén, Sánchez, and their team figured that if they could get RNA out of that ancient mammoth, they'd have a snapshot of the genes that were in use around the moment when it died. The only problem was that RNA doesn't usually hang around for very long. RNA tends to survive mere minutes or hours — generally not millennia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It felt like a very high-risk project,\" says Dalén. \"It seemed like a completely crazy thing to try to do.\" Still, there have been a smattering of studies that have turned up ancient RNA. \"So we knew that there was a chance, if we had some really well-preserved samples, to get this to work,\" he says. RNA reveal party Dalén and his colleagues collected tissue samples from ten different mammoths, including Yuka, and painstakingly worked to extract RNA. The resulting fragments were all very short, either because they were small to begin with or because, despite being frozen, they had broken down with time. Then came the challenging task of piecing those segments together, validating that they really were mammoth RNA. \"The big bulk of the work is on the computational side to make sense of all these gigabytes of data,\" says Dalén. On the other end of that analysis was something unmistakable, he says — woolly mammoth RNA. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most of it was too fragmented to know what it was or where it came from, but three of the mammoths had sufficient material to analyze. That included Yuka, whose muscle had been sampled. The resulting RNA was related to slow-twitch muscle function and development. That was a reassuring confirmation but not surprising. The team also found RNA that would have been produced in response to some kind of stress. \"That would be consistent with an animal being chased down by cave lions, but of course there could also be other explanations,\" says Dalén. \"If you get stuck in mud, your muscles would be stressed out from trying to get out. So we can say that the muscles were stressed at the point of death, but we don't really know why.\" In addition, some of Yuka's RNA came from a Y chromosome. A closer look at the animal's DNA confirmed it had one X and one Y chromosome. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Genetically, Yuka was definitely a male,\" says Dalén. \"In theory, Yuka could have developed as a female. But more likely those critical morphological parts were missing when they did the visual inspection, let's put it that way.\" All told, Dalén says the results are a stunning proof of principle — that it's possible to know which genes were active in a now-extinct animal. \"You're actually seeing processes going on inside the cells right around the time it died,\" he says. \"And these processes have then been frozen in time for 40,000 years.\" Maanasa Raghavan , a paleogeneticist at the University of Chicago who didn't participate in the research, notes that the samples studied here were well-preserved and came from a fairly pristine environment. She's less certain whether the same techniques could be applied to specimens collected in temperate and tropical areas that are richly biodiverse but where preservation tends to be worse. Still, Raghavan called the work \"fabulous in terms of all sorts of technological barriers being shattered.\" She says future work with RNA in these and other mammoth specimens may offer insights into what drove the species to extinction. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       María Ávila Arcos , an evolutionary genomicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who wasn't involved in the study, says the approach provides a new layer of insight into a species that vanished long ago. \"Having this information adds to our understanding how these creatures lived and how they adapted to their environment,\" she says. She's excited by the results — and not just for mammoths. She says they point the way to the potential study of ancient RNA viruses. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"A lot of very important pathogens like Ebola, COVID, influenza — they have RNA genomes,\" says Ávila Arcos. \"They mutate so rapidly. But if we want to understand their evolution or how these viruses have impacted populations in the past, we need to be able to recover the genetic material, which is RNA, from ancient samples.\" In other words, Yuka's RNA has opened a window for us to consider its past, while allowing scientists to dream about all the discoveries that lie ahead. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities have announced plans to deport approximately 89 sick Palestinian patients from East Jerusalem, including children and elderly individuals with life-threatening medical conditions, back to Gaza.

I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities have decided to send all Gazan patients back home next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen and his mother are among at least 89 Gazan patients and their companions due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization has been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients early next week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT about the potential deportation of sick Palestinians to Gaza but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.”\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been update to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-cemetery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Black Soldiers in WWII Removed from U.S. Military Cemetery Spark Controversy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2024, a memorial panel at the Margraten U.S. military cemetery in the Netherlands, which honored the contributions of Black soldiers like 1st Lt.

Jefferson Wiggins, along with hundreds of other Black soldiers, were tasked with burying the dead in the southern Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  What was once a fruit orchard would become the final resting place for thousands of fallen US service members. It was difficult, gruesome work, done in near-constant rain and snow with only pick axes and shovels. Years later, Wiggins would recall how soldiers under his command in the 960th Quartermaster Service Company cried as they lowered the bodies of men into their graves.\n \n\n   \n  The site, in the village of Margraten located in the southeastern part of the Netherlands, became  one of the largest American military cemeteries  in Europe. And for months, visitors to the cemetery, which is run by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), haven’t been able to learn about the soldiers’ work.\n \n\n   \n  In March, the small, little-known federal agency took down a display from the cemetery’s visitor center that commemorates the contributions of Black soldiers like Wiggins, who ultimately reached the rank of first lieutenant and died in 2013, and highlights the discrimination they faced. Most Black soldiers were limited to non-combat roles during World War II.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a matter of a panel that has my husband’s name on it. That’s not the issue,” Wiggins’ widow, Janice, told CNN. “The issue is that these are a group of men who contributed to their country, who, like almost every soldier during World War II, went through great trauma and bore that for the rest of their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins, who learned of the display’s removal in October from two Dutch filmmakers, said her late husband would “be disappointed, but not shocked.”\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t naive about the world he lived in,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC, which  oversees 26 permanent US military cemeteries , told CNN in a statement that the panel in question was taken down following “an internal review of interpretive content” under the agency’s previous secretary, Charles Djou, and there are currently four other displays highlighting individual African American servicemembers buried at the cemetery.\n \n\n   \n  Djou, a Biden appointee who says he was dismissed by President Donald Trump in April, told CNN in an email the panel’s removal was “done via an internal agency review at the prompting of the Trump administration.” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC said, “The panel was initially added upon request by the former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was determined by the previous secretary, following the internal review in March, that while 1st Lt. Wiggins’ quote represented the immense contributions of many African American service members during the creation of the site, portions of the panels were outside the scope of ABMC’s commemorative mission. There was no external consultation or direction regarding its removal.”\n \n\n   \n  The panel, which was added to an exhibit at the cemetery’s $6.7 million visitor center in 2024, was titled, “African American Servicemembers in WWII: Fighting on Two Fronts.” It described how Black service members, “despite the ongoing fight for civil rights at home during an era of racist policies” enlisted in every military branch and faced “the horrors of war.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins pushed for a panel shortly after the center opened in 2023, when she learned that none of the information or exhibits included any mention of the African American soldiers who buried the dead there. She worked with the former US Ambassador to the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal, and Mieke Kirkels, a Dutch oral historian, and the panel was installed months later.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The stark reality’\n \n\n   \n  Wiggins waited until the late 2000s to revisit the memories of his service, which he would recount to Kirkels for an oral history after learning that he was the last known Black member of his unit alive.\n \n\n   \n  The first person they buried was a young German girl, Wiggins recalled in the oral history  rereleased in 2025 . Her body had been mangled by machine gun fire; her head deformed by a grenade blast. As the Allied forces pressed on, more and more bodies of young American men arrived on trucks for Wiggins and his men to lay to rest. Many had been killed during airborne operations in the east or in the course of advances into German territory.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a permanent arrival of bodies, the whole day long. Sundays included, seven days a week,” Wiggins said. “I find it difficult, even now, to read in the paper that soldiers ‘gave their lives.’ … All those boys in Margraten, their lives were taken away.”\n \n\n   \n  “And here we all were - this group of Black Americans having to deal with these bodies of White Americans,” he said. “The stark reality was we had to bury those soldiers although we couldn’t sit in the same room with them when they were alive.”\n \n\n   \n  For Wiggins, remembering what he saw was a painful, but necessary act. Janice Wiggins said he would often tell her that “people should know.” The contributions of Black soldiers during the war had been frequently overlooked — and in some cases lost forever. A fire at the  National Personnel Records Center  in 1973 destroyed millions of files.\n \n\n   \n  “He never ever wanted the story to be about him. He saw his story as a vehicle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, a sharecropper’s son who had lied about his age to enlist in the military, became a lifelong educator and civil rights activist. He was 87 when he died.\n \n\n   \n    Removal causes local uproar\n \n\n   \n  Theo Bovens, a Dutch politician who leads the  Black Liberators in the Netherlands  project, told CNN that local and regional politicians have asked the ABMC to reinstall the panel, along with another that highlights Technician 4th Class George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier from Camden, New Jersey, who died while trying to save a fellow soldier who had fallen into a river in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC told CNN on Monday that the Pruitt panel is “currently off display, though not out of rotation.” The part of the exhibit featuring Pruitt and other African American servicemembers at the cemetery, the agency said, has panels that were “designed to be removed and rotated.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins told CNN that the “panels were never intended to be part of a traveling exhibit or rotation” and “were intended to be a permanent part of the Visitors Center exhibits.”\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Eijsden-Margraten has formally asked the ABMC to reinstall the panels, insisting that the community values the contributions of Black American soldiers that helped liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis 80 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The governing body of the Limburg Province said it hopes to make a direct appeal to US Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo Jr. who was confirmed in October.\n \n\n   \n  “The displayed panels depicted a history we must never forget, and from which we can learn a great deal—especially now, as global divisions are being increasingly magnified,” the body said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/government-shutdown-ends-federal-workers-return","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:16:00.000Z","title":"The government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government shutdown, which lasted 43 days, has officially ended, but federal operations remain severely disrupted.

Cohen, Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:16 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is over. But hundreds of thousands of federal workers   are coming back after 43 days to anything but normalcy, employees from across the country told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Workers who haven’t received a paycheck in weeks will still have to wait for back pay. Research grants will be delayed. Economic reports are likely to be scrapped. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through.\n \n\n   \n  And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers said that the shutdown has been an exclamation point on top of months of chaos as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and, in some cases, entire agencies since the president   took office in January. The administration  sought to fire  more federal workers when the shutdown hit, but the short-term funding deal halted those dismissals until the end of January.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it’s going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.”\n \n\n   \n  For the American public, the lingering effects of the shutdown could be felt for months or even years to come at the nation’s airports. Meanwhile, those receiving government assistance like food stamps are eagerly awaiting the government to finally get funds out the door.\n \n\n   \n    A slew of backlogs\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers back on the clock Thursday will need to assess how to address more than six weeks of   backlogs. Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee.\n \n\n   \n  A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check   their emails at approved times to look   for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn’t lock down after 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  It was “heart wrenching” to see the emails piling up, the person said, including with desperate pleas from parents of disabled children who filed discrimination cases with the department’s Office for Civil Rights. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency’s testing labs, said one worker at the agency’s   Human Foods Program.\n \n\n   \n  Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said.\n \n\n   \n  And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You’re talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.”\n \n\n   \n  A big focus at the National Park Service will be assessing any damage that occurred to parks during the shutdown, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n \n\n   \n  Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said.   But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, many parks didn’t get damaged,” Brengel said. “But this is unsustainable and everyone knows it.”\n \n\n   \n  At NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given,  CNN recently reported .\n \n\n   \n  Some of the sources CNN recently spoke to said they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by the Trump administration to quietly gut the Goddard campus during the shutdown — a claim a NASA spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA   engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.”\n \n\n   \n    When will employees receive back pay?\n \n\n   \n  When the  roughly 1.4 million federal workers  who have been furloughed or working without pay will receive their back pay may vary by agency. Many have  missed  two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, it only took a few   business days for workers to   be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left   amid the administration’s downsizing efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the complexity is that federal workers are not all paid at the same time since the government uses multiple pay systems, said Stier of Partnership for Public Service.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a huge undertaking on top of a lot of other things that the federal employees are going to have to be doing,” he said, though it should take a matter of days, not weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But   “until we get paid, everyone’s going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben   Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\n \n\n   \n    Effects on air travel could linger for years\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown brought chaos to US airports, and the impact   could linger well beyond  the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more   coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n   In May,   the Department of Transportation said   it would replace the decades-old Federal Aviation Administration infrastructure with a new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  At a Wednesday press conference at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said the software and upgrades the new system requires “would take longer than the three-year period,” originally promised.\n \n\n   \n    When will safety net programs be funded?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown wreaked havoc on the  nation’s safety net programs , most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly  42 million Americans  to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  Just when enrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will receive their  full benefits  for November will depend on where they live. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court  paused  a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending  partial benefits  last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month’s aid.\n \n\n   \n  After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. Some, however, could take up to a week to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The spending agreement signed into law takes the threat of another lapse of SNAP off the table in January when another shutdown could occur: The bill funded several agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, for the entire fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n \n\n   \n  It typically takes at least 30 days for the HHS to calculate states’ allocations and get the money out the door for LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. And he fears it will take even longer this year since  HHS laid off its LIHEAP staff  in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  Federal grants for the roughly 140 Head Start programs – serving more than 65,000 children and families – that were affected by the shutdown could take up to two weeks to distribute, said Tommy Sheridan, deputy director at the National Head Start Association.\n \n\n   \n  The funding lapse forced 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico to close. Other programs have been able to maintain their operations thanks for local and philanthropic support.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the timeline for getting funds to LIHEAP and Head Start programs, an HHS spokesperson said that the agency will “work swiftly” to administer LIHEAP annual awards. Head Start recipients can expect to receive communications that will include a timeline for the release of federal funds.\n \n\n   \n    Economics reports delayed\n \n\n   \n  Economic data released by the government — which is used by business leaders and the Federal Reserve to assess the state of the US economy — has been suspended throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Monthly employment reports for September and October haven’t been released, and neither has the first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Once the government reopens, statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release updated schedules on data releases.\n \n\n   \n  But this is the first time there have been two delayed jobs reports. And it’s likely that October’s report will never be released, as data for the month was not collected, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period,” Leavitt told reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Headed for the exit?\n \n\n   \n  Caitlin Lewis, who runs  CivicMatch , which connects federal employees with jobs in state or local governments, said the shutdown has pushed many federal workers to the exits.\n \n\n   \n  There was a 74% spike in federal workers signing up for the platform during the first five weeks of the shutdown, she said, compared to the five weeks before the shutdown. Last week was one of the platform’s busiest weeks in months.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year.\n \n\n   \n  “People want to stick it out as long as they can. But this is the latest in a deep cycle of instability that is pushing public servants out of the government since the inauguration,” Lewis said.\n \n\n   \n  When the last government shutdown ended in 2019, a USDA employee returned to find dozens of emails from state agencies with policy questions, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her work and how much she is needed.\n \n\n   \n  But the stress of this year’s record-long impasse has forced her to start looking for other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “This has been the worst six weeks that I can remember,” said the staffer, who had planned a career with the government. “I cannot afford to go through this again, mentally or financially.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/solar-storm-northern-lights-forecast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:14:00-04:00","title":"Millions saw unexpected northern lights, as a wild solar storm unfolded across the world","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful solar storm, caused by two coronal mass ejections from sunspot AR 14274, led to unexpected auroras visible as far south as Florida and the UK.

storm unfolded across the world \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:14 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For two nights, dazzling auroras delighted sky-gazers in unexpected places, including in the US as far south as Florida. The cause: dual solar storms unleashed by the sun reaching Earth.\n \n\n   \n  A severe storm was initially predicted for Thursday as well, with the potential for the northern tier of the US to see auroras again in the evening. Forecasters at the National Weather Service’s  Space Weather Prediction Center  now believe Wednesday night might have been the last opportunity for the most intense conditions.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to creating auroral displays, geomagnetic storms can disrupt   communications, the power grid and satellite operations. The Space Weather Prediction Center said it had otified power grid and satellite operators in the US so they could prepare.\n \n\n   \n  The British Geological Survey initially believed the current solar activity could lead to a G5, or an extreme geomagnetic storm — the highest level on the scale. The survey also dubbed Tuesday’s event a “cannibal storm” that disrupted communications and GPS satellite accuracy.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, two Coronal Mass Ejections lifted off the sun a few hours apart,” the survey’s geomagnetism team explained. “The first one was moving more slowly than the second  …  and so the second one caught up with the first one and they amalgamated together by the time they reached Earth. Hence, the term ‘cannibalised,’ as the second one gobbled up the first one.”\n \n\n   \n  Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in geomagnetic storms.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters at the Space Weather Prediction Center believe that the arrivals of the first two of three anticipated coronal mass ejections caused   Tuesday evening’s auroral display.\n \n\n   \n  “One of them packed a much stronger punch than we would have imagined originally,” said Shawn Dahl, forecaster at the center.\n \n\n   \n  When a storm reaches satellites stationed 1 million miles from Earth, forecasters can measure its speed, the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic orientation, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it pointed opposite Earth, or is it pointed the same as Earth?” Dahl said. “If it turns opposite Earth, then activity really quickly escalates, and those storm levels can dramatically increase very quickly. That’s what happened last night.”\n \n\n   \n  The third solar storm arrived at Earth Wednesday afternoon at 2:17 p.m. ET, with solar wind speeds over 2.1 million miles per hour (950 kilometers per second).\n \n\n   \n  But Earth appears to have been struck by a far flanking edge of the storm, meaning most of the magnetic cloud likely missed our planet, according to an  update from the center .\n \n\n   \n    Solar storm disruptions\n \n\n   \n  Among those feeling the storm’s effects is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The company was  expected to launch  NASA’s  Escapade mission  — twin satellites   set to head on a long journey to Mars — aboard its New Glenn rocket Wednesday. But the increased solar activity blocked that launch attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch,” according to a  post by Blue Origin  on social media platform   X. The company confirmed on X Wednesday evening that another launch attempt is now scheduled for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of activity around our sun   sparked the storms. Three X-class flares, the most intense type of solar flare, have released from the sun this week, followed by a series of coronal mass ejections.\n \n\n   \n  The recent surge in activity stems from an active region of sunspots on the sun called AR 14274, according to Ryan French, a solar physicist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  “AR 14274 still has the potential to produce more X-class solar flares,” French said. “However, the region is now rotating away from us, so any eruptions from future flares are increasingly less likely to hit us as the days pass.”\n \n\n   \n  An X-class flare released Tuesday created a large solar particle storm, the largest since 2005, according to the British Geological Survey. Tuesday’s solar activity also created the largest measured geoelectric field since the survey’s records began in 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field can reach the ground, which triggers electricity in rocks and essentially creates an electric field in the ground. “This is usually tiny on the order of 0.001 Volt per kilometer but during geomagnetic storms it can be much larger,” the survey team noted.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, experts documented a value of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, an unusually large number that “has not been recorded before,” according to the geological survey’s team.\n \n\n   \n  Large geoelectric fields can interfere with transformers and may even cause them to shut down or overheat.\n \n\n   \n    A changing solar cycle\n \n\n   \n  The sun has an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity. Heliophysicists believe the peak, called  solar maximum , occurred in October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we are still in a period of heightened solar activity, we are entering the decay phase of the solar cycle,” French said.   “(Although) sunspots and solar flares are fewer during this time, this is the period where the strongest solar flares typically occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up.\n \n\n   \n  For those in areas   with clear dark skies, keep an eye out for auroras, which could dip over the US. In the UK, sky-gazers in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland had a good chance of seeing them as well, according to the survey.\n \n\n   \n  The last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in  May 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  The storm was a historic one, but fortunately it didn’t reach the level of the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire and remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded.\n \n\n   \n  During the May 2024 geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.\n \n\n   \n  Before May 2024, the last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The recent outburst of activity reminds French of a severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth in  October 2024 . Tuesday night’s storm clocked in as third strongest solar storm of the current solar cycle, French said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting musical performances from various artists on NPR's Tiny Desk series.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Music","Featured Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582812","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:12:00-05:00","title":"This oil-producing country is moving away from oil.

Here's how it's going \n         By Julia Simon \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 1:12 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea. A few years ago , oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there. It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last. Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2023, Petro pledged to  stop approving new exploration contracts  for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step. Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going? When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil. But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says  Ana Carolina González Espinosa ,  senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says. \"I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,\" she says. \"But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.\" \"It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,\" she says. Why Colombia is doing this Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy. Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector. But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to  a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes . The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050. Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says  Guy Edwards , who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop. \" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,\" González Espinosa says, \"then we are going to be in trouble.\" Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol. The year before Petro took office, the company  acquired an electricity transmission company . In recent years, they've acquired more  solar  and  wind projects . And they're investing in  geothermal energy , drilling deep into the earth to create electricity. \"The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,\" Lemos says, \"but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.\" \"We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.\" Renewable progress and failures A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro. Solar made up around  9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024 , according to data from XM,  Colombia's electricity market operator . That's up from  roughly 1.5% in 2022 . Petro's government has introduced something called \"energy communities,\" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract  international financing  for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently  streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar  making it more efficient, says  Manuel Schulte , chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy. But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says. Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors  have given up on renewable projects ,  particularly wind projects . The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has  acquired some of these abandoned wind projects . Losing the messaging fight Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the \"myth,\" she says, that the country's energy transition \"will be an economic hindrance.\" \" The opposite,\" Muhamad says. \"What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.\" Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press.  His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines  have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as \"disastrous for the Colombian economy.\" Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels. \" They didn't resonate with the national audience,\" González Espinosa says in an email. \"It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.\" Looking to the future  Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote. As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal,  Estefanny Pardo , mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it. \"The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,\" Pardo says in Spanish. An upcoming conference Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023. Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production. Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels. If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through. \"Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   This week, world leaders are in Brazil for the annual U.N. climate conference to talk about how to cut planet-heating emissions. Scientists say a key way is for some fossil fuel-producing countries to stop exploring for new fossil fuels. One country's government decided to do just that - Colombia. NPR's Julia Simon went there to learn more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In a fishing village on Colombia's Caribbean coast, music plays in cafes lining the beach. It is cooler by the sea, where the wind blows through the trees. Out past the fishing boats, out in the turquoise sea, oil companies found deep water natural gas and planned to drill gas wells there. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, wants those wells to be among the country's last. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers, and President Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on climate change. Two years ago, at the U.N. climate conference, Petro took the stage and said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT GUSTAVO PETRO: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: \"Colombia,\" he says, \"has stopped signing exploration contracts for coal, oil and gas.\" This was a big deal. Stopping new exploration for fossil fuels is a key way to transition away from fossil fuels. Now the question is, how is Colombia's energy transition playing out? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: OK. To find out, I went to a leafy neighborhood in central Bogota, in the high-rise office of Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol. There I met... JULIAN LEMOS: Julian Lemos. SIMON: ...Corporate vice president of strategy and new business. Lemos says the oil company is diversifying. Ecopetrol has acquired an electricity transmission company, more solar and wind projects, and they're investing in geothermal, drilling deep into the Earth to create electricity. LEMOS: The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company, but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power transmission. SIMON: Energy experts say this isn't just a good move for the climate. It's a good move for Colombia's economy. Colombia has manufacturing, tourism and agriculture, but the government is still very reliant on the oil and coal sectors for revenues. Ana Carolina Gonzalez Espinosa, at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute, says as Colombia's oil reserves shrink and demand for oil and coal eventually fall, that will be a problem. ANA CAROLINA GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: If we don't think about how we'll diversify the economy, then we are going to be in trouble. SIMON: Key to diversifying the energy sector is solar and wind. Solar, in particular, is growing - both large-scale and small-scale projects for communities lacking electricity. But the sector has problems too. In some parts of Colombia, the grid still isn't big enough to handle all the new solar and wind. Many projects are on land belonging to Indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve them in planning, says Margarita Nieves, a renewable energy researcher. She says some renewable developers have left. MARGARITA NIEVES: Each project has its own challenges. SIMON: Petro's term ends in 2026, and that raises another question. Will his energy policies outlast him? Petro's government hasn't awarded new licenses to explore for fossil fuels, but this isn't signed into law. A new, right-wing government could change gears and bring in more companies to explore for coal, oil and gas. So is Colombia's energy transition story a happy one? Gonzalez Espinosa has thoughts. GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: It is not a happy story. It is not a sad story. It's just a real story. SIMON: Julia Simon, NPR News, Bogota, Colombia.

Now she's been put on leave \n         By Andrea Hsu \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 2:09 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institutes of Health, says she has been put on paid leave following the end of the government shutdown. \"I was not given a reason for being put on leave, but I strongly suspect it is because I have been speaking up in my personal capacity about the harms that I have been witnessing inside the National Institutes of Health,\" she said in  a video posted to TikTok . The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\" She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize  a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists , pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. In  an interview with NPR in early October , Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes. \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\" Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\" Agriculture Department employee also on leave On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave. Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about SNAP cuts in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.  \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\" MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity. A right to speak on matters of public concern Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest. She points to a  1968 Supreme Court decision  that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights. \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\" Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out. \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away.

How to find what works for you and get outside \n         By Gabrielle Horton, Audrey Nguyen \n        \n           Tuesday, April 19, 2022 • 12:03 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Being \"outdoorsy\" can stir up images of big beautiful national parks, snowy slopes or lush, green forests. But smaller moments in nature, like walking my dog around the neighborhood or even listening to a rain sounds playlist as I fall asleep, have been just as valuable — and don't require the time, money or physical mobility of a big trip.  No matter how you access it, a  growing body of research  shows that nature has enormous emotional and cognitive benefits on people \"including improved attention, lower stress, better mood, reduced risk of psychiatric disorders and even upticks in empathy and cooperation,\" according to the American Psychological Association.  \n       \n      Related Story:  New To Camping? Here's How To Get Started \n       Whether you're gearing up for a backpacking trip or a virtual aquarium tour, here are five small steps you can take to get closer to nature: 1. Think of time in nature as a \"multivitamin\" — it's best to take it every day   Getting your daily dose of nature is vital to your well-being, says  Ming Kuo , who runs the  Landscape and Human Health Lab  at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \"Nature helps our mental muscles relax and recover,\" she explains. For example, if you're spending hours staring at a computer screen or reading something difficult, you might feel pretty exhausted afterward. \"If we get our breaks or even our micro restorative moments\" by getting outside, Kuo says, \"we recover some capacity to use that mental muscle so we can do things that are hard to do.\" And it's not just our brains that benefit from nature. Kuo says our immune systems need it, too. \"Our research suggests that it's not a luxury,\" says Kuo. \"It's actually what you need to function well. ... It's kind of like a multivitamin.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  Why does my plant look sad? 6 tips for raising happy houseplants  \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  North American birds are in decline. Here are 8 simple ways you can help \n       If you can't physically get outside, you can still access nature and reap the benefits: Take a break to  watch the birds  from your window or  tend to your houseplants .  \"Nature includes everything from 'capital N' beautiful, spectacular, untouched wilderness all the way to a window box,\" says Kuo. 2. Find your people Finding a crew who enjoys the same activities you do takes some of the pressure off trying to navigate the outdoors alone, and it's an important way to stay safe in more remote areas. In a world where we're constantly inundated with images of what an \"outdoorsy person\" should look like, finding your people might feel like a challenge.  Ash Manning  is a plus-size explorer who hasn't always felt welcomed on whitewater rafting excursions or overnight hikes. \"I think being bigger, it's always been like, 'Am I the only one doing this?' The answer is no, absolutely not,\" Manning says.  Eventually, the Appalachian native found  Unlikely Hikers , a nationwide hiking group for \"adventurers who are plus-size & fat, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, queer, trans and non-binary,  disabled , neurodivergent and beyond.\"  Looking to find your people? Check out groups like  Disabled Hikers ,  Black Men with Gardens ,  Fat Girls Hiking ,  Textured Waves  and more.  3. Bring the outdoors into your world Remember, you don't have to  be  outdoors to experience its wonder. We are a part of nature, and nature is a part of us — regardless of where we are.  Need a quick break from your \"work screen time\" for some \"fun screen time?\" There's a nature fix for that: Check out the  #FindThatLizard  game on  Twitter  and  Instagram . Science communicator and herpetologist  Earyn McGee  posts a picture of a lizard \"camouflaged in its natural environment, and people have to find the lizard in the photo.\" You don't even have to leave your couch to play.  Trying to get off screens? You can barbecue in your yard or the park, enjoy natural scents with an aromatherapy diffuser or open a window to get some fresh air. These are great options if you're living in a city, or if you're disabled, immunocompromised or on a budget. 4. Learn about the origins of \"our\" outdoors and celebrate Indigenous history  Before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, most people of color were  legally denied access to or segregated  at state and national parks. \"[Parks] were actually  designed  to be exclusive, so if you can't get to them, it's not your fault,\" McGee explains. That exclusion extends to the erasure of Indigenous peoples from these lands and the environmental movement at large.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Yellowstone turns 150. Here's a peek into the national park's history \n       Recognizing the Indigenous history of the land we're on can really ground our experiences in the outdoors, says Oregon State University (OSU) anthropologist  Spirit Brooks . As a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Brooks' focus is on \"shifting this dominant narrative of wilderness and conservation and those ideas being rooted in settler colonialism.\"  Learn about which tribes are local to you and \"the Indigenous place names in your area for streams, for mountains, for parks,\" Brooks says. Apps like  Native Land  and  Whose Land  are great places to start.  Ultimately, deepening our appreciation for nature, in whatever ways, is good for ourselves today and for future generations, too.

As a kid growing up in Los Angeles, I loved being outside. Making mud pies, doing cartwheels and collecting roly-polies were some of my favorite ways to enjoy the outdoors. But as I got older, something shifted, perhaps a mix of what I was seeing in magazines and on TV, plus other people's ideas of what makes someone an outdoorsy person. I started noticing that my love for the outdoors - well, it got complicated. It felt like only big-N nature mattered - you know, the national parks, ski trips, overnight camping, all fun things but activities that require a certain level of physical mobility, lots of travel time and, of course, money. While I could save up or plan for some of those bigger experiences here and there, I also realized just how deeply I felt about little-N nature - the smaller day-to-day moments that gave me a chance to bring nature in my way and with greater ease. And over the past two years, as we've all had to renegotiate our relationship with the outdoors, I've been thinking about this a lot. For this episode of LIFE KIT, I got a chance to talk to several nature enthusiasts about ways that all of us might find our footing outdoors. And as you can tell, it won't be a conversation just about sweeping wilderness views and weeklong safaris. It will include ways to honor Indigenous land practices, find an outdoor community group and even play your way through nature. In the fall of 2021, I embarked on one of my biggest big-N nature excursions yet. I headed off to Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. And to be honest, I've never been a national park girl, per se, but it was hard to deny the sheer beauty of it all. My time away in the Canadian Rockies was everything. But more than that, being out there, exploring new hiking trails - it just felt so good. And when I got back to LA, I found myself smiling and laughing more, going through my camera roll full of flowers, and I just couldn't shake this feeling. But the good news is that we don't have to go to Banff every weekend to reap these benefits because the thing is, nature is all around us, and it means something different to all of us. So I reached out to Ming Kuo, an associate professor of natural resources and environmental sciences to get her thoughts on it all. MING KUO: I define nature the way the scientific literature does, which is that originally, you know, when people studied nature, they were studying capital-N nature - wilderness. HORTON: At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Ming's research focuses on how being in green environments affects our quality of life and social behavior. And over the years, her work has expanded to create a much more comprehensive view of nature, too. KUO: Nature includes everything from capital-N beautiful, spectacular untouched wilderness all the way to a window box or having a view of squirrels from your office window or the little tiny bits of nature that are part of our potentially very urban lives. HORTON: So whether you're tapping into big- or small-N nature, professor Kuo shares that there are enormous benefits for our mind and body, which leads us to our first takeaway - nature is the ultimate multivitamin. So go out and get it. KUO: If you wanted to summarize all of my work - and really, a huge number of researchers' work - in a single sentence, it's that nature is an essential component of a healthy human habitat. HORTON: I know. You're probably like, human habitats? But people forget - we're animals, too. KUO: We know from ethology, the study of animals in the wild, the study of animals in zoos and in labs, that when animals are housed in settings that are appropriate to them, that fit them, they do better socially and psychologically and physically. And that's basically what we see with people. HORTON: Ming tests out this theory often in her own habitat. KUO: One thing I've done over the years because of my research (laughter) is that I walk to campus. It's about a 15-minute walk. And my neighborhood is tree-lined because I chose a place that was - with tree-lined streets. And I walk with my chin up and my eyes in the canopy, kind of flowing through the river of trees, both to and from campus. HORTON: But I was still curious, though. What exactly does nature do to the brain? Why is it so essential? KUO: One is that nature helps our mental muscle relax and recover. HORTON: For instance, if you're spending hours at a computer screen or reading something difficult, you're pretty exhausted afterwards. So there's a reason why you're encouraged to get some fresh air to give yourself a mental break. KUO: If we get our breaks or even our micro-restorative moments through the view outside, we recover some capacity to use that mental muscle so we can do things that are hard to do, and we can do them more easily and less painfully. HORTON: When we spoke, Professor Kuo also mentioned how pivotal nature is in building up our immune systems. And to put it simply, nature heals. It's not some add-on bonus. It's something we all need to make room for. KUO: But what our research suggests is that it's not a luxury. It's actually what you need to function well. It's kind of like a multivitamin. So you should get it (laughter) even if it's nice. You know, just because it's nice, doesn't mean you don't need it. HORTON: With all the benefits that nature has to offer us, why does it seem to be so hard to access it or that it's a luxury for a select few? Speaking with herpetologist and science communicator Earyn McGee really helped to put it all into perspective for me. EARYN MCGEE: I think the biggest thing to remember is you still count as an outdoors person and a nature person even if you can't get to these big national parks. They were not designed to be inclusive. They were actually designed to be exclusive. HORTON: Earyn's right. This history of exclusion from public recreational sites like state and national parks has had a big impact on how people like Earyn, a Black woman, even connect to the outdoors today. And don't worry, we'll get a chance to hear more from her later on. But prior to the 1964 civil rights bill, most people of color were legally denied access to or segregated at these outdoor sites, especially big national parks. But even before that, don't forget that these lands were originally stolen from Indigenous peoples. And as poet Karenne Wood reminds us, nothing was discovered. Everything was already loved. And this sentiment couldn't be more true for anthropologist Spirit Brooks. Her work considers how we can acknowledge the ancestral homelands we're hiking, running and living on. SPIRIT BROOKS: I think it kind of reframes our relationship to land and place, maybe in a different way than traditional approaches to, say, environmental education. So if we're emphasizing our relationship to land as a foundation for instruction or how we center the well-being and the futures of Indigenous nations, we're really sort of shifting this dominant narrative of wilderness and conservation and those ideas being kind of rooted in settler colonialism. HORTON: That leads us to our second takeaway - recognize the history of the land. It will truly ground your experiences in the outdoors. A citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Nations, Spirit's work seeks to expand the lens of nature from something that is often white-centered to something that's much bigger than us humans. BROOKS: I really think about nature as Mother Earth. And what I think about when I think about earth as the mother and land is really land as first teacher. And I think about nature as kind of more than human, right? And possibly, that's because of my Indigenous worldview. So I think of plants and animals as our brothers and sisters on this earth, and it's just kind of a part of who I am. HORTON: At Oregon State University, Spirit is able to share Mother Earth with students across the state. There, she works with the Outdoor School, a publicly funded statewide outdoor science program for fifth and sixth graders. This approach to land-based education centers Indigenous history and traditions. And that weeklong coursework might look different depending on if kids live in the mountains or if they live along the Pacific Coast. BROOKS: It might be curriculum related to salmon and streams, and it might focus on land-based education that centers the Indigenous peoples that live on the coast in Oregon. HORTON: There are six P's that guide Spirit's work, but we're going to just focus on three that you can even incorporate into your own nature appreciation. So there's place, which, in practice, might look like a land acknowledgement. BROOKS: I think this could be as simple as learning about the Indigenous place names in your area for streams, for mountains, for parks, and then making an effort to learn about contemporary efforts to steward local native lands in sustainable ways by tribes. HORTON: Then there's presence, which recognizes that there is still very much a vibrant Indigenous presence in our communities and across the U.S. And then there's perspective. BROOKS: We ask educators that we work with to think about some critical questions about their outdoor education curriculum. Whose perspectives are represented? Who benefits from those representations? And how are those perspectives valued or devalued? And then, I think, really importantly, what perspectives are missing? HORTON: So the next time you're at a state or national park, pick up a brochure, read the plaques or even check out apps like Native Land to get started because there's just so many perspectives missing. And it's something that outdoor professional Ash Manning didn't even realize as a young kid. ASH MANNING: I am from Appalachia, and I was born in Athens, Ga., but I was raised in the holler. HORTON: Even though Ash was always a bigger kid, they never second-guessed their love for nature. It wasn't until they went away to college when that love started to change. MANNING: I questioned being in the outdoors for a long time when, in reality, my entire childhood was in the outdoors. It was so odd. Like, you know, everyone has a right to be out there. But it's like, why did I ever think that I didn't have a right to be out there when my entire childhood was just me rolling around in some grass and making mud pies? HORTON: And the messages that they didn't belong were coming from those around them. MANNING: I started to realize that there was a lot of, like, gatekeeping on trails. There was a lot of, like, weird feeling towards plus-size people when it came to the outdoors. HORTON: Eventually, one of Ash's friends invited them to a whitewater rafting excursion in the Grand Canyon. Ash was hesitant at first, but ultimately decided to join the group, which leads us to our third takeaway - dive into the outdoors with others. MANNING: And it was pivotal because I went down the grand, and I, like, found myself just eating it up and loving every second of it and learning how I work in a boat and how to read water better and how to be a better guide and how to be a better oarsman or how to paddle better for myself and the people around me. HORTON: With her faith in Mother Nature restored, Ash wanted to find nature groups where being plus-size wasn't an anomaly. MANNING: I think being bigger - it's always been like, am I the only one doing this? The answer is no, absolutely not. There's so many of us. And I really started to kind of see that when I kind of figured out who the Unlikely Hikers were, which was started by Jenny Bruso. HORTON: Unlikely Hikers is an outdoor community featuring the underrepresented outdoors person, meaning adventurers are plus-size and fat, Black, Indigenous, people of color, queer, trans and nonbinary, disabled, neurodivergent and beyond. You can find Unlikely Hikers on Instagram, but you can also meet nature guides like Ash on hiking trails all over the U.S. And as you can probably tell, doing nature in community as a white plus-size person has given Ash a whole new confidence and freedom. MANNING: And I think that there's something refreshing for me, knowing that I can take my body into the outdoors, and it does not matter what anyone else's opinion is or was. It does not matter, like, what I've been through to even try to be out there because I can just commune with nature and just kind of be out there and just exist. HORTON: Getting out there and trying things out in a group setting can also be a lot less daunting. You can figure out what you like and don't like in the company of others. Not to mention, going out with a crew is a practical way to stay safe in more remote areas and to connect with others that have similar interests and backgrounds as you. So check out groups like Melanin Base Camp, Disabled Hikers, Outdoor Asian, Brown People Camping - just to name a few. MANNING: I think you have to ask yourself, like, does the physical side of it appeal to you? Does the meditative part of it - like, is that what draws you in? Or is it - you know, is it the adrenaline? You want cool Instagram photos? I don't know. I mean, like, there's so many questions that you can ask yourself. HORTON: So what do you want out of nature? When you stop and ask yourself that question, it's like a whole new world opens up. Given the limited access many have to big-N Nature, finding other ways to connect to the outdoors is critical and just as worthy. But you don't have to take my word for it. Here's Ming again. KUO: There's a kind of famous study in which they looked at people recovering from gallbladder operations. And it turns out that if you were in an identical room to recover but one room has a view of a brick wall and the other one has a little view of a small bit of trees, then you recover faster, in general, in the room with the green view. HORTON: This leads us to takeaway No. 4 - bring nature in - into your room, into your life, and even into the palm of your hand. As a herpetologist, Earyn McGee is constantly thinking about ways to bring her research on lizards and climate change to her followers on Twitter and Instagram, where she's best known as the creator of the #FindThatLizard game. MCGEE: #FindThatLizard is a game that I run every Wednesday. And essentially, I post a photo of a lizard camouflaged in its natural environment, and people have to find the lizard in the photo. They don't have to go outside. HORTON: And she's not just talking science, y'all. Earyn uses the game as a way to connect what's happening in lizard habitats with today's news headlines, kind of like that time she wanted to raise awareness about student protests at her alma mater, Howard University. MCGEE: I talked about how lizards were being impacted by habitat loss. And then I said something along the lines of, in addition to making sure that we have proper habitat for these lizards, we also need to make sure that we're having proper housing for students. HORTON: As everyone so far has gotten at, we are a part of nature and it's a part of us. And we can have fun with what that relationship looks like with other online games like Crow or No and Just the Skull. There's even things like live wildlife webcams and virtual aquarium tours. And don't worry, we'll link to some good ones on our episode page. But these are just some ways that we can bring the outdoors to us. And it's especially useful for those who might be disabled, immunocompromised and/or unable to spend money on fancy gear and travel. MCGEE: I'm also super into houseplants, and that's a way of bringing nature into your house. So either you can have, like, houseplants or you can start, like, a small garden or something. And that's a really great way to start thinking about ecosystems and the environment. HORTON: Other ways to immerse yourself in the outdoors can include, but are absolutely not limited to, barbecuing in the backyard, opening the windows to get fresh air, using an essential oil diffuser or even taking a walk in the neighborhood, something me and my puppy Tex love to do. But no matter how you decide to engage with nature, it's important that the generations after us can do so as well. And, no, you don't need to solve climate change on your own by next year. But that leads us to our fifth and final takeaway, which is to appreciate the outdoors for our todays and our tomorrows. BROOKS: The world is kind of a [expletive] show right now. It's a mess. And with climate change and the impact of pollution and greed on communities of color specifically, I feel like it's more important than ever for all of us to have a connection to nature and the outside. HORTON: This is it, y'all. This is our home that we share with other animals and our plant siblings, and we should start getting to know each other really well. If nothing else, it's a reminder to get to know ourselves and get back to our inner child, who's very eager to make some more mud pies. So I hope this has been helpful and a whole lot of fun because finding your footing in the great outdoors is a wonderful experience that we all need and deserve. So whether you've climbed to new peaks in the Rockies or you've started sharing photos of your favorite flowers in the group chat, all of it counts. So before we go, let's recap. Takeaway 1 - nature is the ultimate multivitamin, so go out there and go get you some. Takeaway No. 2 - recognize and celebrate the Indigenous history of the land we are on. It will truly ground your experiences in the outdoors. Takeaway No. 3 - explore the outdoors with others. Take a friend. Find new friends. But just don't feel like you've got to go about it alone. Takeaway No. 4 - bring the outdoors into your world, whether it's caring for houseplants or playing that #FindThatLizard game. And our final takeaway, No. 5 - create a legacy that inspires others around you to appreciate the outdoors, too.

Busting 6 popular myths about hangovers \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Tuesday, November 26, 2024 • 2:56 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Hangover cures are a dime a dozen. Guzzle a few raw eggs. Take an aspirin before bed. Chug a beer in the morning. These remedies promise to banish some of the nasty symptoms that can come with drinking way too much alcohol: headache, nausea, vertigo, anxiety — or all of the above. But is there truth to any of these claims? Unfortunately, no, says  Dr. Ryan Marino , a medical toxicologist and an emergency physician at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. \"I wish there was some magic drink everyone could have, but there isn't.\"  The only surefire way to prevent a hangover is to abstain from drinking, he says. And once you have a hangover, the only thing that will get you over it is time. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you plan to drink alcohol and want to reduce potential symptoms, practice moderation, he says. That means limiting your alcohol intake to one drink a day or less for women, and two drinks a day or less for men, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Experts break down the science behind six common hangover myths — and explain how alcohol affects your body. Myth: All hangovers are the same. The symptoms and severity of your hangover — like your alcohol tolerance — depends on many factors, says Marino. That includes age, weight, gender, ethnicity, family history, nutritional status, smoker status, mood, health conditions or whether you're taking any medications. \"Your hangover is going to be different from everyone else you know,\" he says. For example, while one person might experience headaches and vomiting after just one drink, another might throw back whiskey gingers all night and wake up feeling tired but otherwise unscathed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In fact, some people may not experience any symptoms. According  to one study , about 25% of people who drink to intoxication don't have hangovers at all. The length of hangovers can also vary. They can last 24 hours or longer depending on how much you drank, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Myth: You can prevent a hangover by drinking water or using hydration supplements. Alcohol increases urine production, so it's true that dehydration can often contribute to the hurt of a hangover. But that's only one symptom of over-imbibing, says Marino. Drinking can cause inflammation, gastrointestinal irritation, disrupted sleep and low blood sugar. It also exposes you to acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct produced when your body metabolizes alcohol, that can damage your cells and tissues. Don't expect products like sports drinks, vitamin-infused patches or hydration packets to work any miracles before or after a night on the town, says Marino. While they may keep you hydrated, they likely won't address any other hangover symptoms. But drinking water or other hydrating beverages during a night out is still a good idea, he says. It can help you practice moderation and remind you to space out your drinks. Myth: A \"hair of the dog\" can stop a hangover in its tracks. Some people think that a \"hair of the dog,\" an alcoholic beverage consumed the morning after a night of heavy drinking, can help cure a hangover. It may offer some temporary relief by raising your alcohol levels and masking symptoms like jitteriness or anxiety, says Marino. \"But your hangover is just going to be pushed down the road.\" A hangover can be a mild form of alcohol withdrawal, according to the NIAAA. Hangover symptoms peak — and likely, feel their worst — when the body's blood alcohol concentration returns to zero. Eventually, that bloody mary you had at brunch will leave your system, and you'll have to deal with the aftermath. You're not doing yourself any favors by piling on, says Marino. Myth: Beer before liquor, never been sicker. Liquor before beer, in the clear. Some people swear by this adage. But in general, it's not the order of alcohol that determines the severity of your hangover, says Marino. It's how much you consume. You're likely to drink more alcohol in a shorter amount of time if you kick off your night with hard liquor, he says. It makes you inebriated faster -- and you may feel inclined to drink more than you would slowly sipping a beer. Some kinds of liquors may make hangovers more unpleasant. According to research, dark liquors like bourbon and brandy contain higher levels of congeners, or the chemicals produced during the fermentation process that give an alcohol its distinctive taste, smell and color. Generally speaking,  the more congeners an alcohol has, the worse the hangover is likely to be. Myth: Taking painkillers before bed can help you get ahead of hangover symptoms. While it's a common practice to reach for over-the-counter pain relievers to try and minimize your headache in the morning, Marino says you could potentially do a lot more harm than good. Consuming just one alcoholic drink a day with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil, Aleve or aspirin can increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding by 37%,  according to the NIAAA. When you combine alcohol with drugs containing acetaminophen, like Tylenol, you run the risk of liver damage, according to the NIAAA. Ingesting too much of one or both substances can be toxic to the liver. For that reason, the Food and Drug Administration advises against drinking when taking any medicine that includes acetaminophen. If you're taking any type of medication, proceed with caution, says Marino.  \" Even if your medication doesn't have a label that says 'Do not take with alcohol', that doesn't mean you can't be affected.\" Myth: Hangover symptoms are physical. It can also affect your mental health. Drinking too much can make you feel overwhelmed, irritated or on edge. And there's a term for it that's been trending on social media: \"hangxiety.\" While alcohol can initially have a calming effect, your body can rebound as it leaves your system, causing a surge in adrenaline, a racing heartbeat or feelings of worry or stress, says  Dr. Nzinga Harrison , a physician specializing in psychiatry and addiction medicine. It's a tricky symptom to identify. You can experience hangxiety after even just one drink, says Harrison. And \"it can come before physical symptoms or without physical symptoms at all.\" To combat hangxiety, Harrison suggests doing activities to bring down your adrenaline levels, like mindfulness and meditation, and bring up your dopamine — like spending time with friends and getting lots of sunshine. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And while the only way to fully prevent hangxiety and hangovers is to abstain from alcohol, she says it helps to go into social situations in the best possible headspace. Before you go to that party, drink water, eat well and make sure you're surrounded by people who make you feel positive and connected. \"All of that biologically and psychologically may not prevent the hangxiety entirely, but will decrease the severity of the hangxiety,\" says Harrison. A quick note: If alcohol is causing you stress or harm, seek medical advice. There are a variety of treatments, including counseling, medications and support groups, to help people who want to end that dependency. This includes Alcoholics Anonymous, which has helped countless people. This  NIAAA guide  can help you find a program that's right for you. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. Today we're talking about that awful morning-after feeling. And if you're listening to this episode, you probably know what I'm talking about. You wake up, and the sun's too bright. Your head is throbbing. Your heart's racing. Maybe you've got body aches or nausea or dry mouth or, if you're really going through it, all of the above. You start replaying the night before in your head and panicking. What did I say to that person? Was I being too loud? Hangovers, man - they are not pretty. And I think intuitively, we know that it's not good for our bodies when we drink that much. But to be honest with you, drinking alcohol in smaller amounts isn't exactly good for us, either. RYAN MARINO (PHYSICIAN, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS CLEVELAND MEDICAL CENTER): Not to say that people need to give up their one drink with dinner. That's not my point. It's just that there is no safe amount. A small amount is not healthy. SEGARRA: Dr. Ryan Marino is a medical toxicologist and emergency physician at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MARINO: Alcohol is a toxin. All forms of alcohol are directly toxic to pretty much every cell in your body. SEGARRA: According to the CDC, alcohol is a leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. It's linked to several cancers, cardiovascular disease and driving fatalities. And yet, we can hear the stats and still head out to happy hour with friends. And I'm sure I don't have to spell out why. NZINGA HARRISON (CO-FOUNDER, ELEANOR HEALTH): If you want to loosen up at a party, alcohol works. If you want to go to sleep - for most people - alcohol will make you sleepy. If you have anxiety, alcohol will take the anxiety off. If you want to de-stress after a long day, alcohol will do that. And so it's effective until it becomes the problem. SEGARRA: Dr. Nzinga Harrison is a physician specializing in psychiatry and addiction medicine. She's also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Eleanor Health, a company that provides mental health and substance use disorder treatment services. Now, this doesn't mean she came to this story riding on a high horse, though. HARRISON: I have definitely had a hangover. I am personally familiar as well as professionally. SEGARRA: We want to acknowledge something upfront. There is some thought in the medical community that by offering advice on hangovers, we might be glorifying alcohol or even enabling people to misuse it. But both Dr. Harrison and Dr. Marino agree not talking about hangovers isn't going to make the problem of binge drinking or alcohol misuse go away. MARINO: I am not in denial enough to think that people are going to hear that there's no safe amount of alcohol and everyone can stop drinking or is going to want to stop drinking. People really just need to know their risk-benefit profile. SEGARRA: So on this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to help you with exactly that. Reporter Andee Tagle will share helpful insights from doctors Harrison and Marino on how to be smarter and more mindful about your drinking before, during and after a night on the town. We'll walk you through some alcohol science, help you understand your personal risk factors when you drink, and give you tools for assessing your relationship to alcohol. ANDEE TAGLE (BYLINE): OK. Some quick trivia I just have to share to start - the medical term for a hangover is veisalgia, which is a combination of the Greek word for pain and a Norwegian word meaning uneasiness following debauchery. It's a little on the nose but a fittingly large umbrella because, takeaway one, hangovers, like alcohol, affect everyone a little differently. And heads up - it's not just a battle against dehydration. So we know there's no such thing as healthy consumption, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does have a definition for safe drinking. And it's probably less than you think. One drink a day or less for women and two drinks a day or less for men. HARRISON: And one drink is like one shot or one four-ounce glass of wine, not these mega glasses that we have these days. TAGLE: The recommendation is actually five ounces of wine these days, but the point still stands here. So that's your baseline to start. But... MARINO: Every person is going to have a different experience from their consumption from drinking, as well as their kind of hangover experience on top of that. So, like, your water volume hydration status, your body composition, body fat to muscle tone. TAGLE: Your tolerance to alcohol can vary from day to day and from setting to setting based on a bunch of different characteristics. Your age, weight, gender, ethnicity, family history, nutritional status, smoker status, your mood, if you have any health conditions, big or small, or if you're taking any medications. And if we're just talking hangovers, according to one study, about 25% of people who drink to intoxication don't experience them at all. For some people, one evening glass of wine could lead to vomiting, muscle aches and anxiety. But for their sibling at the same dinner table, an entire night of mixed drinks could equal tiredness, dehydration and not much more. MARINO: And so even though we recognize this universal experience of a hangover, your hangover is going to be very different than everyone else that you know. TAGLE: What is universal? Most hangovers are a pain that can last in range from eight to 24 hours, although even that isn't a hard and fast. And they peak when your blood alcohol concentration returns to zero. End of list. Why is there so much variance in the hangover experience? The answer isn't super satisfying. MARINO: The short answer is nobody really knows. But the better answer is that we do know there are a lot of factors involved. TAGLE: See, every hangover is a multipart equation. MARINO: The most important thing is the alcohol itself. And so there is no way to completely avoid a hangover if you're going to be drinking. And that is because one of the metabolites of alcohol, acetaldehyde, which is what your body first breaks the alcohol down into, causes these feelings that we describe as a hangover. TAGLE: Then there's sleep deprivation. Alcohol wrecks your sleep and not just for people staying up late barhopping. MARINO: The quality of sleep that you get if you have alcohol in your system is very low. People get less REM sleep. TAGLE: Next up, let's talk sugar and salt. MARINO: Alcohol also causes pretty significant effects, especially in, like, binge drinking or chronic drinking, on the way your body metabolizes sugars, sugars that are kind of the primary metabolic component for functioning of all processes within your body. And so you can be very low on sugar, and that's why people don't feel good after drinking. TAGLE: To be specific here, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia. That's when your blood sugar levels drop below standard range. Essentially, your liver chooses to process the alcohol instead of maintaining your blood glucose levels, so your blood sugar drops and that can give you some of those classic hangover symptoms - the shakes, the sweats, lightheadedness. So if any of those feelings sound familiar, it might be a good idea to lay off mixers or super sweet cocktails. Alcohol can also famously cause dehydration and throw off your body's sodium balance, certainly another factor of why hangovers can hurt. Dr. Marino says, yeah, it's important to stay hydrated. A Gatorade, Pedialyte or similarly electrolyte-infused beverage before you go out or the morning after certainly won't hurt. But you shouldn't expect them to work miracles either. Now, what about alternating between alcoholic drinks and water during a night out? The doctor says having a nonalcoholic drink for every alcoholic beverage is definitely a good starting tip. But... MARINO: That ends up then kind of encouraging people to drink more or just drinking large volumes of water or something, which can also have risks. TAGLE: And this brings us to the myth-busting portion of our story because there's, like, a lot of so-called hangover cures out there these days. So I asked Dr. Marino could preventing a hangover be as simple as a pre-game vitamin, a party patch or super-duper hydration packets? MARINO: So the short answer, I would say, is no. And the long answer, I would say, is no. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Fair enough, funny guy. MARINO: I'm sorry. That was a terrible joke. But none of these are evidence-based, and there's no reason to believe that any single proprietary supplement is going to treat or prevent a hangover. The only way to reduce your hangover is to drink less alcohol. TAGLE: And that's Takeaway 2. The only cure for a hangover is to abstain from alcohol. But there may be some things that could make that hangover better or worse. Let's start with the old adage beer before liquor couldn't be sicker - liquor before beer, in the clear. What say you, doc? MARINO: In general, that's not going to affect anyone's ability to get or recover from a hangover. TAGLE: So Dr. Marino's verdict - there's no truth to this little ditty. Start with what you want. Mix things up if you like. It's the quantity, not the type of alcohol, that will make the difference for most people. That said, everyone reacts to alcohol differently. And some people will have sensitivities that others don't. For example, an estimated 8% of the global population experience facial flushing when drinking. You might've heard of this as Asian glow because this reaction, caused by a specific genetic mutation that makes it more difficult for the body to process acetaldehyde, largely affects people of East Asian descent. Red wine is often cited as a source of headaches, potentially due to sulfites or histamines, although no one's exactly sure. And in one study, it was found to be a common alcoholic trigger for people who suffered from migraines. There's also some research that points to a specific troublemaker in hard liquor. Studies have shown that darker liquors, like bourbon and brandy, can make hangovers worse because they contain higher levels of congeners. These are the chemicals produced during the fermentation process that give an alcohol its distinctive taste, smell and color. And generally speaking, the more congeners an alcohol has, the worse the hangover. So that buddy that swears by vodka just might have a point. Now, what about popping a couple of painkillers before bed to get out in front of that headache? Short answer - not a good idea. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, consuming just one drink a day with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil, Motrin or Aleve can increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding by about 37%. When it comes to combining alcohol with drugs containing acetaminophen, like Tylenol, you can run the risk of liver damage if you ingest too much of one or both substances. That's why the FDA advises against drinking when taking any medicine that includes it. And just in general, it's good to be mindful when you're on any meds. MARINO: Even if your medication doesn't have a little sticker on the label, it doesn't mean that you can't be affected. TAGLE: Now let's turn to food. Having a hearty meal before you drink is definitely a good idea. You don't want to drink on an empty stomach. Eating after a night out won't soak up the booze, as some people might claim - the only thing that sobers you up is time - but it should help with that blood sugar crash we were just talking about. Now, are salty, carby, fatty foods the best for hangovers? Could French fries be the magic cure? Wishful thinking, I'm afraid. MARINO: So I am a big fan of greasy food myself, but this is not going to help the hangover. TAGLE: It's natural to crave fatty, calorie-dense comfort foods, but those won't help you get up and running any faster. Instead, opt for bland foods or the BRAT diet if you're feeling queasy - bananas, rice, applesauce, toast. Or if stomach problems aren't an issue, go for vitamin-rich foods like fruits and vegetables to replenish what you might have lost. Finally, what about hair of the dog - you know, cracking open in a beer or ordering a tall Bloody Mary to drink away the pain of the night before? MARINO: That's definitely not going to help your hangover. It might make people feel better because you're kind of getting some of the desirable effects from alcohol on board. And a lot of the hangover effects are kind of those things people don't like feeling - fight or flight reactions. And so having any sort of anxiety or that kind of thing, the alcohol might help with that temporarily, but you're kicking the can a little bit. TAGLE: And this brings us to takeaway three. Be aware of and tend to anxiety. Thus far, we've talked a lot about the physical side of a hangover. Now let's move into the realm of mood and emotions. Ever wake up after one too many and just feel like crying - lump in your throat, butterflies in your stomach, an amorphous, roving sense of guilt or dread? Dr. Harrison says hangover anxiety symptoms like these are a common experience because of how alcohol works in the body. Without getting too technical, alcohol binds to certain receptors in your body - called GABA receptors - that help you feel calm and uninhibited by slowing down certain signaling. So when that alcohol is eventually cleared out of your system... HARRISON: You get that rebound phenomenon. GABA was turning down that heart rate. Once that alcohol is gone, the heart rate bounces back up. It was turning down that blood pressure. The blood pressure bounces back up. It was turning down that churn in your stomach. It bounces back up. This is the basis for hangxiety (ph). TAGLE: And what makes hangxiety extra tricky is that it doesn't require excessive or even heavy drinking to happen. So you might not even place it as a hangover symptom when it pops up. For some people - especially those who already experience things like anxiety, depression or any other mental health condition - feelings like sadness, hopelessness, worry or panic the day after drinking may be acute and therefore more obviously linked to alcohol consumption. But for others... HARRISON: It can come before the physical symptoms come. It can come without physical symptoms at all, and you're just like, I don't even have a hangover, but why do I feel so on edge? Why do I feel so irritable? Why am I worrying about things? This is hangxiety. TAGLE: Just like physical hangover symptoms, the only way to fully prevent hangover anxiety is to not drink. But one first step to keep your dark cloud from getting too heavy is to simply realize that your hangover can come with significant emotional side effects. And they'll need care, too. HARRISON: Just knowing arms people with the information to say, like, oh, I know what this is. OK, I'm going to hydrate. I'm going to take some electrolytes. I'm going to go be with friends so that I can get dopamine from nurturing. I'm going to eat some delicious food so I can get dopamine from food, right? TAGLE: Dr. Harrison says if you have lead time for an event where you know drinking is involved, prepare accordingly. That means practicing good health and getting yourself in the best possible headspace. HARRISON: Like, try to go into that cruise well-slept, well-hydrated, eating regularly around the clock, with a good sense of connection, you know, feeling a sense of belonging, feeling positive. All of that biologically and psychologically may not prevent the hangxiety entirely but will decrease the severity. TAGLE: From there, she says, if you find yourself going through the ringer, you might start with a warm bath. That'll help wash away the night before and feel more soothing than the potentially harsh sounds of a shower. Throw in some aromatherapy, if you like. Her recommendation - lavender and citrus because they can help the turnover of dopamine. HARRISON: So that's going to bring up that dopamine crater that you're experiencing. Mindfulness and meditation brings down adrenaline. And so if you have a meditation practice or a mindfulness practice or a yoga practice, this will actually help your hangxiety. TAGLE: Now, something you might note here - sometimes nourishing your emotional needs will be at odds with your physical ones. Only you can do the triage there. Like, OK, maybe your body is asking you for a dark, quiet morning and a lot of time in bed. But at the same time, your brain won't stop yelling about all of last night's mistakes and worrying about the next month's problems. In this case, rather than sitting in the dark berating yourself, the healthier choice might be to don some sunglasses, brave some movement and ask your most soft-spoken friend if they're free to join you for lunch somewhere. You can get some comfort food and some sun. HARRISON: And it's not just, like, because sunshine is nice. No, like, actually, the UV rays change your brain chemistry. Actually, the vitamin D changes your brain and body chemistry. TAGLE: Now, maybe you're wondering, when is hangxiety or a hangover cause for concern? Well, medically speaking, they're not usually. Alcohol poisoning, however, is very much a serious matter. Dr. Marino says if someone is vomiting uncontrollably, so intoxicated they can't protect their airway or their mental status is off, maybe they're confused, coming in and out of consciousness, it's time to call 911. On the emotional side, if someone's behavior is putting them at risk of harming themselves or others, you can call or text 988 for free, confidential support for people in emotional distress 24 hours a day. If your scenario doesn't quite meet those extremes but something is still worrying you, Dr. Marino says you can and should still ask a professional about it. You know your own brain and body best. And with that, we've reached takeaway four - consider the cage. Now that we've thoroughly dissected the effects of alcohol and hangovers, we want to introduce you to a tool to help you interrogate your relationship with alcohol - something both doctors agree is a great thing to do, whether or not you're at all worried about your drinking. It's called the CAGE questionnaire. It's an acronym for four simple questions. If you answer yes to at least two questions... HARRISON: This is a real signal that I want to try to change the way I am drinking alcohol. TAGLE: Now, if you only answer one question with a yes... HARRISON: Even though you don't meet diagnostic criteria, it's telling you that the way you're using alcohol is presenting some risk to you. So, like, now, this is an opportunity. TAGLE: The first question, C, stands for have you ever thought about cutting back? HARRISON: A stands for annoyed. Have you ever been annoyed when someone else mentioned your drinking to you? TAGLE: G stands for guilt, as in, you said you were only going to drink one glass, but you drank the whole bottle. You had a few too many and said something you shouldn't have. HARRISON: And then E is for eye opener. Have you ever needed to take a drink the moment your eyes open? TAGLE: Dr. Harrison's score, for example, was two because she's thought about cutting back, and she did, actually. She and her husband stopped drinking entirely about a year ago. And she's felt guilt from drinking in the past. The example she gave us was the time she, as captain of her cheerleading squad, once passed out from binge drinking the night before the big homecoming game. HARRISON: So two represents a significant risk about the way I was drinking back in college and in medical school, right? I can use that information as an opportunity to make a different decision about the way I'm drinking, thankfully, before I developed an alcohol use disorder. TAGLE: So if your score makes you feel like wanting to make a change of some kind, Dr. Harrison has some very simple advice. HARRISON: Just tell at least one other person because that secret makes it scarier than it has to be. And if you have support, that support is nurturing, gives you a dopamine signal that helps your brain think differently about your decisions around alcohol. TAGLE: That could be a best friend or a faith leader, a primary care doctor or EAP at work - anyone who makes you feel safe. And it doesn't have to be some big formal conversation. HARRISON: You don't have to be like, I have trouble with drinking. If you drink every day, I would say, just try not drinking every day and see how it is. And if you notice a difference in yourself, then maybe that's the beginning of thinking about how to make different choices. TAGLE: Of course, it might not just be that easy. Dr. Harrison says it can be really hard to talk about this stuff with loved ones because there's so much misunderstanding around alcohol use disorder. But maintaining that stigma only hurts people. HARRISON: The majority of people with alcoholism recover to controlled use. You don't have to go to 30-day rehab. You don't have to go to AA. Like, the things that work for people are very different, and I just want people to know there are lots of options, and whether you give yourself a label or not, you have the right to choose the role that alcohol plays in your life. TAGLE: And this is the exact message you can pass on if there's anyone in your life who might need it. Just make sure to lead with compassion. HARRISON: You just say, you know what? I was listening to NPR. I heard this doctor talking about the CAGE, and she said, think about somebody you might be worried about. And I thought about you. And I just want you to know if you're worried about it at all, I'm a person you can talk to about it. TAGLE: Then just leave the ball in their court. HARRISON: And they might take you up on it in the moment. They might take you up on it later. They may never take you up on it. But what you did was plant a seed of compassion, which has an opportunity to grow. TAGLE: And even if you feel entirely unconcerned or simply neutral about your own alcohol consumption, it's worth remembering cutting back on alcohol is a game of inches, not yards. Meaning every bit less can be to your benefit. MARINO: If someone's able to drink one less drink a day, I mean, this might be the difference between going into liver failure in 10 years or something like that. And so if people are open to having those nuanced discussions and conversations, there are plenty of ways we can modify the way people consume alcohol to better protect them. TAGLE: Ready for terrible hangovers to be a thing of the past for you and your people? Dr. Harrison says we have to start deprogramming from our alcohol-obsessed culture and start practicing positivity around sobriety. HARRISON: When somebody says, I'm sober curious, be like, yeah, that's awesome. If somebody's like, I'm just only going to drink two drinks tonight, be like, cool. When you - I see you get into that third drink, I'm going to be like, you said you're only going to drink two, right? Like, how can we be supportive about this curiosity and just making it a normal part of the conversation? TAGLE: OK, let's recap. Takeaway one - hangovers hit different for everyone because we're all different and because alcohol wreaks havoc on your body in a lot of different ways, which is why Takeaway two - the only sure cure for a hangover is to abstain from alcohol. However, there may be a few factors, like congeners or sugar content, that may affect the severity of your hangover. Takeaway three - hangxiety is real. Prepare accordingly, and don't forget to nourish your emotional needs, too. Takeaway four - consider the CAGE questionnaire, and share widely. You never know who you could be helping. And don't forget to spread some sober positivity where and when you can. And you're sure the answer still isn't French fries? MARINO: (Laughter) I mean, I think French fries can help a lot of my anxiety. I'm not going to lie about that. SEGARRA: That was LIFE KIT reporter Andee Tagle.

They broke records \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:32 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The first of 30 Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — have been auctioned off to support public television. Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show  The Joy of Painting . More than 400 half-hour episodes aired on PBS (and eventually the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) from 1983 to 1994, the year before Ross died of cancer at age 52. Ross' impact lives on: His show still airs on PBS and streams on platforms like Hulu  and Twitch . It has  surged in popularity  in recent years, particularly as viewers searched for comfort during COVID-19 lockdowns. Certified instructors continue teaching his wet-on-wet oil painting  technique to the masses , and the  Smithsonian acquired  several of his works for its permanent collection in 2019. But his artwork rarely goes up for sale — until recently.  In October, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) announced it would auction off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. It pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide. Auction house Bonhams is calling it the  \"largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market.\" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting and some activists have  even invoked him  in their calls for restoring federal funding to it. \"It's a medium that Bob just cherished,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc., in a phone call with NPR. \"With the cuts, it's just a natural inclination to support public television.\" The first three paintings sold in Los Angeles  on Nov. 11 . for a record-shattering $662,000. Bonhams says the works attracted hundreds of registrations, more than twice the usual number for that type of sale. Each sold for more than its estimated worth, led by  Winter's Peace,  which fetched $318,000 to set a new Ross auction record.  \"As anticipated, these paintings inspired spirited bidding, achieved impressive results and broke global auction records, continuing the momentum we've seen building in [Ross'] market,\" said Robin Starr, the general manager of Bonhams Skinner, the auction house's Massachusetts branch. \"These successes provide a solid foundation as we look ahead to 2026 and prepare to present the next group of Bob Ross works.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The next trio of paintings will be auctioned in Massachusetts in late January. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston. How the offering could benefit public broadcasters  At President Trump's direction, Congress voted in July to  claw back $1.1 billion  in previously allocated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), leaving the country's roughly 330 PBS and 244 NPR stations in a precarious position. CPB began  shutting down  at the end of September, PBS has  already cut 15%  of its jobs, and several local TV and  radio stations  have also announced layoffs and closures. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think he would be very disappointed\" about the CPB cuts, Kowalski said of Ross. \"I think he would have decided to do exactly what we're doing right now ... I think this would have probably been his idea.\" Kowalski, whose parents founded Bob Ross Inc. together with the painter in 1985, said Ross favored positive activism over destructive or empty rhetoric. \"That just was his nature,\" she said. \"He was like that in real life. So I think this would have been exactly the thing that he would have chosen. I suddenly got really emotional thinking about that.\" The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the  national TV channel Create , which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including  The Best of the Joy of Painting  (based on Ross' show),  America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and  Julia Child's  French Chef Classics . Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them. \"This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,\" the auction house says. Ross' paintings rarely hit the market The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all \"previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes\" of  The Joy of Painting,  according to Bonhams. Many have remained in secure storage ever since. They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and \"happy trees\" that became his trademark. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,  he later said , his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service. Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just \"happy accidents,\" talent is a \"pursued interest,\" and it's important to \"take a step back and look.\" \"Ross' gentle teaching style and positive philosophy made him a cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the art world,\" Bonhams says. While Ross was prolific, his paintings were intended for teaching instead of selling, and therefore rarely go on the market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, Bonhams sold two of Ross' early 1990s mountain and lake scenes as part of an online auction of American art. They fetched $114,800 and $95,750, surpassing expectations and setting a new auction world record for Ross at the time. Kowalski says that's when her gears started turning.  \"And it just got me to thinking, that's a substantial amount of money,\" she recalled. \"And what if, what if, what if?\"  Bonhams officially estimates that the 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million. But Starr, of the auction house, predicted in October that they will continue to exceed expectations, based on their artistic value, nostalgia factor and more.  \"Now we add in the fact that these are selling to benefit public television, I think the bidding is going to be very happy,\" she said. \"Happy trees, happy bidding.\"  Disclosure: This story was edited by general assignment editor Carol Ritchie and managing editor Vickie Walton-James.

Now the late painter's company wants to give back. It is auctioning off dozens of his original works - many of them painted live on a show - to support public TV after federal funding cuts. NPR's Rachel Treisman reports. RACHEL TREISMAN, BYLINE: Bob Ross brought his soothing voice, sunny outlook and trademark afro to over 400 episodes of \"The Joy Of Painting,\" which aired on PBS between 1983 and his death in 1995. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") BOB ROSS: We don't make mistakes, you know. We have happy accidents. TREISMAN: Decades later, viewers are streaming it online and still watching it on public TV. It's a medium that Ross cherished, says Joan Kowalski, the president of Bob Ross, Inc. JOAN KOWALSKI: He used to talk about that a lot. He felt like he was in someone's living room and it was just that one person. TREISMAN: At the direction of President Trump, Congress voted in July to claw back over $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, slashing funding for PBS and NPR stations across the country. The next month, the auction house Bonhams sold two Bob Ross paintings for over $200,000 combined, exceeding their estimated value to set a new record. KOWALSKI: And it just got me to thinking, you know, that's a substantial amount of money, and what if? What if? What if? TREISMAN: Kowalski, along with Bonhams and American Public Television, came up with a plan. They will auction off 30 of Ross' original paintings, with all net proceeds going to APT and PBS stations nationwide. They hope the money raised will help stations pay the licensing fees to air popular programs like \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Rick Steves' Europe\" and \"The Best Of The Joy Of Painting.\" Kowalski says if Ross were alive today... KOWALSKI: I think this would've probably been his idea. TREISMAN: It's rare for Ross' paintings to make it out of storage and onto the market. He painted most of these 30 works on TV, while some are from his instructional books. They won't all be sold at once. The first three paintings are going up for auction in Los Angeles in November. Here's Robin Starr, the general manager of the auction house's Massachusetts branch. ROBIN STARR: Throughout the next year or so, we will be metering out the other 27 works, and those will be coming up out of our California, New York and Massachusetts galleries. TREISMAN: Many are Ross' trademark landscapes, with vibrant mountains, lake views, lush forests, and his signature happy little trees. Here he is working on \"Home In The Valley,\" a 1993 painting that will be up for auction in November. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") ROSS: It's very simple, and it will teach you how to use all the equipment. And it's a lot of fun. TREISMAN: The auction house estimates the paintings could bring in up to $1.4 million, but organizers are hoping they will once again exceed expectations. As Starr said, happy trees, happy bidding. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") ROSS: And with the old signature on here, I think we're going to call that one finished. TREISMAN: Rachel Treisman, NPR News.

  By Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 12:58 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is upending its homelessness policy, with deep cuts to funding for long-term housing. Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said  the new policies  will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing  Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that. In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups. The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled. \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement. The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments. \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement. The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets. But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels. Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an  executive order he signed in July , which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction. \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer. \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own. There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help. \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles. For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608894","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:42:00-05:00","title":"Comey and James seek case dismissal, arguing prosecutor was illegally appointed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James are seeking dismissal of their indictments, arguing that the interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan was illegally appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, bypassing Senate confirmation and judicial oversight.

\n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 1:42 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a judge Thursday to dismiss the cases against them, saying the prosecutor who secured the indictments was illegally installed in the role. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. That decision could help determine the fate of the politically charged cases, which were both shepherded by the hastily installed Halligan and together have amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being used as a weapon to target President Donald Trump's perceived adversaries. Halligan was installed in the job at Trump's urging by Attorney General Pam Bondi in September, just days before Comey was indicted, in what defense lawyers say was an end-run around the constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of U.S. attorneys. They say the maneuver was designed to ensure indictments against the president's political opponents after the prosecutor who had been overseeing the two investigations, but had not brought charges, was effectively forced out. \"Ms. Halligan was the sole prosecutor in the grand jury room, and when the sole prosecutor lacks the authority,\" said Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey's defense lawyers, \"that's not going to be a harmless error.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. attorneys, top federal prosecutors who oversee regional Justice Department outposts across the country, are typically nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. Attorneys general do have the authority to name an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James argued that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges the exclusive say of who gets to fill the vacancy. The interim US attorney resigned under pressure After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Bondi installed Halligan, a White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience. The appointment followed a Trump post on Truth Social in which he complained to Bondi about the lack of prosecutorial action against his political enemies and said, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role. But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do. \"If the government were to prevail here,\" McDowell said, then it \"would never need to go through Senate confirmation again for U.S. attorneys.\" He said any dismissal of the indictment must be permanent, with no opportunity to bring the case again, to avoid rewarding the government for a violation. The Justice Department defends Halligan's appointment The Justice Department maintains that the law does not explicitly prohibit successive appointments of interim U.S. attorneys by the attorney general. Henry Whitaker, a lawyer for the department, argued that the indictment was properly returned by a grand jury and should not be dismissed over what he described as at most a paperwork or clerical error. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The grand jury made a decision based on the facts and the law, and they followed their oath,\" Whitaker said. He also said that even if there were questions about Halligan's appointment, they were resolved by the fact that Bondi had personally ratified the indictment and reviewed the grand jury proceedings. But Currie, the judge, questioned whether that was possible given that a section of the grand jury proceedings that were produced to her was, for unexplained reasons, missing a section. A Justice Department spokesperson later said that there was no missing time and that the time period in question concerns when the grand jury was deliberating, which \"would not be included in a transcription.\" Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. The challenges to Halligan's appointment are part of a multiprong effort to get the prosecutions tossed before trial. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed. Trump's history with Comey and James Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump \"unethical\" and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an \"untruthful slime ball\" and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598474","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Community Engagement in Cultural Projects: A Path to Sustainable and Inclusive Development","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article from April 2023 discusses the growing importance of community engagement and public participation in shaping cultural projects.

Trump himself has used the word against his own opponents. Others have used the word to denounce Skinny-Tok as \"body fascism.\" But why are Americans so willing to use the word? And is its ubiquity making it lose its meaning? In this episode, Brittany is joined by Nicholas Ensley Mitchell, a professor of education and policy at the University of Kansas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Episode Highlights Why \"fascism\" has become a go-to term LUSE: What are people trying to point out when they return to the term \"fascism\"? What are they really trying to say? MITCHELL: Danger. Fascism as a meme is closely synonymous with danger. [It communicates that] there is a threat and it's an active threat. Whenever you call someone a fascist, you call a group a fascist, you are not just saying that, \"Oh, they just exist.\" No. These guys are trying to take something away from you. They are trying to repress you. So it's a recognition that there is danger, and it's coming after me. It's an ingrained alarm in American culture. And I think despite all the changes in how it's been used in American history, it retains that sense of urgency. That this is not something to sleep on. The keys to fighting fascism could be in American history MITCHELL: When you think of Jim Crow as fascism, then that makes Black history and the resistance to Jim Crow an example of how you fight fascism. We have this image of the Civil Rights Movement: the bus boycotts, Rosa Parks is tired so she won't give up her seat, Martin Luther King gives a speech where he just talks about the content of character. What it actually was, in many regards, and how segregationists saw it, was a revolt. Black people have been calling — I mean, we've been talking about fascism [since] the thirties. Langston Hughes, he says in 1937, \"We Negroes in America do not have to be told what fascism is [in action]. We know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Is \"fascism\" the right term for our current moment?   LUSE:  [Responding to Mitchell saying \"cultural upheaval\" more aptly describes our current moment]  I mean, when you say \"cultural upheaval,\" that phrase is so neutral. I think that makes sense. But I will say, that when you say that to me, I understand why some people, regardless of where they are in the political spectrum, would reach for fascism because \"social upheaval\" doesn't satisfy the feeling of fear and discomfort that I think many people feel when these big moments of change are happening. MITCHELL: I would agree. And I think that's why you see this term get used so much. I think being afraid and being anxious, that is a normal reaction. That is not people overreacting. Because [cultural upheaval] is the environment into which European fascism emerged. But also, it's the environment that the civil rights movement really worked its power to force America to be a democracy. That is the outcome of the civil rights movement. I use the term cultural upheaval because these are tectonic shifts happening in the culture. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         BRITTANY LUSE, HOST:   Over the past few weeks, we've been breaking down the history, subtext and evolving meanings of the buzzwords you hear all over the news and social media. This is the ABCs of the culture wars. Our final word is F for fascism. NICHOLAS ENSLEY MITCHELL: We don't have a lot of terms in American society that are kind of cross-political, cross-cultural. Fascism is one them. LUSE: That's Professor Nicholas Ensley Mitchell. He teaches education theory, policy and practice at the University of Kansas. And he's right. You hear this word all over the political spectrum - from the press account of California Governor Gavin Newsom calling Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller a fascist in all caps on X, to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump calling former Vice President Kamala Harris a fascist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She's a Marxist, communist, fascist. LUSE: So how do we make sense of the word fascist being thrown around like this? Well, Professor Mitchell has been writing about the history of the word, and he's offering a perspective that I haven't really heard in mainstream conversations about fascism. MITCHELL: So I think we can talk about this really as just a meme, in the sense that we talk about other memes on the internet. Fascism - it's a succinct way of talking about an oppressive cultural regime or government or, you know, even vibe. LUSE: Yeah. I mean, to your point, it's not just being used in a political context. Like, I've seen people accuse some influencers of, quote-unquote, \"body fascism\" when they talk about weight loss and body image. You know, it shows up in a lot of different parts of American discourse. MITCHELL: And the reason for that is really tied up in American history. I mean, going really back into the - to the Second World War, you know, which is this conflict that just defines America. LUSE: What Professor Mitchell means is that modern American identity was crystallized in opposition to fascism. I mean, if you grew up in the American school system, I'm sure you can see the image right now of American soldiers heroically going to Europe to fight the Nazis in World War II. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT: Never before has there been a greater challenge to life, liberty and civilization. LUSE: They were fighting against fascism, against an ideology seen as counter to the American ideals of freedom and democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROOSEVELT: We believe that the Nazis and the fascists have asked for it, and they're going to get it. MITCHELL: Fascism is explicitly authoritarian. It is chauvinistic. It is sexist, and it is ultra nationalistic and racist. It's very obsessed with us and them. It's not just government. It's a full cultural movement. It is obsessed with aesthetics, how people dress, how people talk, symbols on buildings, the layout of cities, you know, ghettos versus where everybody else could go. LUSE: Other scholars define fascism as a dictatorship with enthusiastic public support and say that fascism can develop in a democracy when the people start to feel their leader doesn't have enough power to avert a perceived national crisis. And, you know, these definitions might stir a feeling in you right now. But there's an important difference between feeling that something is fascist and a formal system of fascism. MITCHELL: You know, in a democratic pluralistic society, you know, meaning is determined by individuals. You know, we determine meaning for ourselves. In a fascist society, meaning is determined by the state. They tell you what the history means. They tell you what everything means. LUSE: And in Professor Mitchell's essay, titled \"Want To Learn How To Respond To Fascism? Study Black History,\" he lays out why he thinks American history showcases this country's much older relationship with fascism, long before Nazism and World War II. MITCHELL: Fascists are always concerned with, like, let's have this mythic past so then we can control who we are and say who belongs and who doesn't belong and whose grievances and histories are real and who's are just complaining. In my experience, they all try to go for a very sanitized history, rather than what I call the messy truth. LUSE: Today, we're getting into why Professor Mitchell thinks this country needs to deal with what he calls its own fascist past. MITCHELL: And that's the messy truth of American history. It's a lot of contradictions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: Hello, hello. I'm Brittany Luse, and you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, a show about what's going on in culture and why it doesn't happen by accident. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: You know, we're going to get into the exact polling in a second, but a big headline from the past year is that a majority of Americans - particularly Democratic voters - have said that they see Trump as a fascist or dictator-like. I mean, if you did a quick search right now, you can find think piece on think piece arguing, you know, whether the country is sliding into fascism. I know a lot of people have concerns about our current moment, but is fascism the right descriptor for it? MITCHELL: Oh, that's a huge question. LUSE: (Laughter) Sorry. Sorry to lay that on you. MITCHELL: Oh, well, I mean, it is not surprising to me that people use that term because this term has been used various ways. I mean, of course, Nixon was called a fascist. Reagan was called a fascist. Obama was called a fascist... LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: ...For the Affordable Care Act. But also during the war - you know, in the war on terror, the term Islamic fascism was so common. LUSE: Right, right. MITCHELL: And that happens exactly when social media is starting to take off. That's early Facebook, later early Twitter - or X now. LUSE: Well, to kind of think in terms of today, a widely talked about poll from October 2024 taken right before the presidential election found that 49% of Americans identified Trump as a fascist. To your point about this being a political meme, 22% also described Vice President Harris as a fascist. Now, in April of this year, in another poll, 41% of Americans strongly defined Trump as a, quote, \"dangerous dictator,\" compared with 27% who strongly defined him as a, quote, \"strong leader who should be given power to restore America's greatness.\" What do these snapshots say about the state of this country? MITCHELL: For the past 25 years, we have been in this really intense cultural battle over who are we and who do we want to be? And we've had so much dynamic change in the past 25 years from, you know, Bush, 9/11 war on terror. And then you get the first Black president. And then, you know, Trump, from completely outside of the political world, he comes in, and then that brings his own - its own sort of upheaval. Me, personally, I think that when historians look back on this era, we're going to look at kind of like the twin - like, the twin poles of the change of whatever comes after this, it's going to be Obama and Trump. LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: Like... LUSE: And they also represent - they - even just in the popular imagination, they represent, in some ways, things that can feel very polar opposite to many people. MITCHELL: Yes. LUSE: And they are side by side. MITCHELL: And who gets to have power? And, you know... LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: ...Who, you know, that - you know, Obama, this, you know - and not just for him being, you know - him being African American. He's also not - he's an academic. He's very new to politics. And then you have Trump. Trump is a businessman, and he was a media figure, very kind of pop cultural figure. Of course, both of - you know, these aren't the first academic president and, you know, Trump's not the first... LUSE: Or the first, like, celebrity president, either, yeah. MITCHELL: So with all that change and all that clash, it does not surprise me that people were out there calling Obama a fascist, and it does not surprise me that people are calling Trump a fascist because that meme is our - it's our stand-in for there's a lot of change, and it's scaring some people. LUSE: So is kind of calling President Trump fascist, is this kind of - is this just like political name-calling or something adjacent to that, that may need some more teasing out? MITCHELL: I think it's the second one. We're grappling - I think Americans are grappling with how to make sense of a lot of this. So, like, there's one really key fact that I think is relevant to any discussion about Trump - and I don't know why more people don't talk about it. Every single one of Donald Trump's electoral coalitions was multiracial. It was multiclass. I was multi-ethnic. Multiracial fascism is not something that happens. LUSE: I mean, it - I know what you're saying is true. We have reported on these things... MITCHELL: Yes, you all have, yeah. LUSE: ...On this show before, but pulling just that fact out for a second and looking at it, it - I mean... MITCHELL: So... LUSE: It's like - it feels like you hit reset on my brain. MITCHELL: Trump didn't just have one multiracial coalition. He had three. LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: In the third election, he picks up a third of the non-white vote. You can't ignore that in any of these conversations, but a lot of people do. LUSE: Yeah. I guess maybe part of what you're saying then is that fascism doesn't quite fit as a descriptor because Trump has a diverse coalition backing him and that, you know, the idea of a multiracial coalition doesn't really fit with the definitions of fascism. And maybe there's a different word that might fit better. MITCHELL: So it's like, when you put it all together, what does this say about who we are - and into that uncertainty. LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: That's where you're going to see fascism get a lot of track in the popular culture as a meme for describing what they're seeing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: Coming up - the words Professor Mitchell thinks define this moment. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: Thinking about fascism again and in the broader sense, not just in the way that people are maybe using it to describe a swift political change that feels wrong to them, many Americans think of fascism as something very un-American. Not just, like, against American values, but more specifically, something that has happened before in history, but never here. But you argue that America has a strong history of fascism in Jim Crow and in American segregation. Tell me more about that. MITCHELL: Sure. We have this interesting and very impoverished view of Jim Crow. We'll talk about it as oh, it was separate water fountains and separate schools. No, it was that, but it was also ghettoizing people. It was brutalizing them. It was state-sanctioned murder and terrorism. You know, you get, like, you know, events like Red Summer where you have nationwide race riots. And then, of course, you get probably, you know, the most famous of those being the Tulsa Race Massacre in 1921. If I put those sorts of things in a European context, we would call those pogroms. LUSE: Yeah, yeah. For those who don't know, pogroms were violent attacks or riots targeting Jewish people by both Russians and Germans in the 19th and early 20th century. MITCHELL: You know, so you have these parallels between what's happening with Jewish people and minorities in, you know, Nazi Germany and in Europe and what's happening in the United States. It's the sort of thing that inspires the Nazis. The Nazis are looking at American eugenics for inspiration for their own murderous eugenics programs. LUSE: And just to lay out our timeline here - the Jim Crow period in the United States was from 1877 to around the 1950s. Nazism and its eugenics program really took off in the 1930s, when Jim Crow laws were still in effect. MITCHELL: You know, there's a great book, \"Hitler's American Model,\" that gets into how much the antisemitic laws were directly inspired by the Jim Crow laws, and they have the - one of the big justices, rather, of the Nazi regime saying in the book - and it's me paraphrasing - this set of laws is great for us. The only problem is that it considers Jewish people to be white. LUSE: I mean, I think, you know, some people might argue that Jim Crow isn't exactly quote-unquote, \"fascism,\" but in your view, why do you think it's important to frame Jim Crow like this? MITCHELL: When you think of Jim Crow as fascism, then that makes Black history and the resistance to Jim Crow an example of how do you fight fascism. We have this image of the Civil Rights Movement that, you know, you get the bus boycotts, Rosa Parks is tired so she won't give up her seat. LUSE: Right. MITCHELL: Martin Luther King gives a speech where he just talks about the content of character... LUSE: Right. MITCHELL: ...Versus what it actually was in many regards, and honestly, how segregationists saw it, that it was a revolt. Black people have been calling - I mean, we have been talking about fascism in the '30s. You know, Langston Hughes, he says in 1937, we Negroes in America do not have to be told what fascism is. We know. LUSE: So even the conversation we are having right now is not new. This is (inaudible). MITCHELL: Yeah, it's about a hundred years old. I want to say - I mean, Du Bois linked Jim Crow and fascism and, like, imperialism. But I think the big takeaway for me when I was talking about understanding Jim Crow as a form of fascism and why is that important, it's because in America, we have this view of American democracy as these ancient pillars driven into the ground. But if you're going to be bluntly honest, can you call yourself a democracy if a bunch of your people can't vote because of the color of their skin? LUSE: It's a fair question. MITCHELL: Or because of their sex? So to me - and I agree with the scholars who, you know, argue this - that America doesn't become a liberal democracy until 1965... LUSE: When the Voting Rights Act is passed. MITCHELL: ...When the Voting Rights Act is passed. So then in that sense, American liberal democracy is very fragile. It's new. Black people and non-white people and also white people across the political spectrum who were, they're down with this - they're down with the Civil Rights Movement - so conservative, liberal, all of that, they joined this revolt to overthrow this system. It's a multiracial creation. It's a multi-ethnic creation. It's a multipolitical creation. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and progressives all had hands in creating this thing. LUSE: For people who are seeing the continued stripping of the Voting Rights Act, for people who are thinking about the fact that most Americans support legalized access to abortion, and now, that's something that's not guaranteed by our Constitution anymore. MITCHELL: Yeah. LUSE: Many people feel like their rights are being stripped away. And I understand where you're coming from, where you say multiracial fascism is not a thing. I'm not necessarily saying that that's the proper term, but I'm trying to think about people who are going to be listening who might think, OK, well, if that's not fascism, then what is? What's a better descriptor? What's a better way to name this? MITCHELL: Cultural upheaval. I think we are in a period of intense cultural upheaval where the entire social contract is being relitigated. LUSE: I mean, I'll say, when you say cultural upheaval, that phrase is so neutral (laughter). And I think that, like, that makes sense, but I will say that when you say that to me, I understand why some people - regardless of where they are on the political spectrum - would reach for fascism, because social upheaval, it doesn't satisfy. It doesn't satisfy the feeling of fear and discomfort that I think many people feel when these big moments of change are happening. MITCHELL: I would agree. And I think that's why you see this term get used so much. I think being afraid and being anxious, those are - that is a normal reaction. That is not people overreacting because that is the environment into which, you know, European fascism emerged. But also, you know, it's the environment that the Civil Rights Movement really worked its power to force America to be a democracy. That is the actual outcome of the Civil Rights Movement. You know, I use the term cultural upheaval because these are tectonic shifts happening, you know, in the culture. And really, the question is, what's going to happen? How are people going to react? Because the government does not have the ability to just renegotiate the social contract. The entire culture is going to do that. LUSE: I have one last question. I mean, you know, even in the absence of total, you know, consensus regarding the characterization of our current political moment, because there are lots of people who feel like the country is moving in the right direction, what are people trying to point out or say when they return to the term fascism? What are they really trying to say? MITCHELL: Danger. Fascism as a meme, it is closely synonymous with danger. There is a threat, and it's an active threat. Because whenever you call someone a fascist or you call a group a fascist, you are not just saying that as a simple category of, oh, they just exist. No, like, these guys are trying to take something away from you. They are trying to repress you. So it's a recognition of there is danger, and it's coming after me. It's a ingrained alarm in American culture. And, you know, I think, despite all the changes and how it's been used in American history, it retains that sense of urgency that this is not something to sleep on.

How to make the most of your cash \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Updated Thursday, April 14, 2022 • 6:54 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It doesn't take an expert to know that money is so much more than dollars and cents. Our relationship with money is  emotional.  Hopes and fears, guilt and shame — they can all play a significant role in your financial life.  And those feelings can be tied to lots of things: our upbringing, our environment, plus, y' know, all the money messaging in the world and the media. But honing those feelings and creating your own strong, secure financial voice? That takes some expertise.  Tiffany Aliche, better known as The Budgetnista, is a financial expert, educator, and author of the new book  Get Good With Money   (out March 30) .  Her book is a super practical guide to getting your financial house in order to achieve what Aliche calls financial wholeness. It's based around ten pillars: budgeting, savings, debt, credit, learning to earn, investing, insurance, net worth, getting your financial team in place and estate planning. Her book dives deep into each of these topics, but Aliche says this process begins with understanding your own financial identity and the many feelings and environmental forces that shape it.  \" For me, money is more mindset than dollars and coins, \"  she says. We can all, says Aliche, get good with money — we just have to get good with our feelings, first. Read on for tips for accessing your emotions around money, and learning to strengthen your financial voice. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.  Andee Tagle: You talk about how you used to live in the state of financial fear, and you say that financial wholeness is the cure to that financial fear, or to financial trauma. I love that idea. How do you define that term?  Tiffany Aliche:  I define financial wholeness as when all aspects of your financial life, and there's ten that we lean into truly — when all of these aspects of your financial life are working congruently for what I like to call your greatest good, your biggest benefit and your richest life. I would say financial freedom is for the few, but financial wholeness is for everyone. It doesn't matter how much you make. It doesn't matter what you do for a living. It doesn't matter how old you are. Financial wholeness can be achieved by everyone. And so it's just a holistic view of what to do with my money and how to maximize and make the most of it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How Filing Taxes Will Be Different Because Of The Coronavirus \n       I want to talk a little bit about the emotions behind money. I loved what you had to say about being aware of the influences in our life that might affect our habits and our financial voice. I know in my own life, for example, I immediately thought about how my dad was always super, super frugal. You know, he asked for discounts wherever we went. That's a really valuable skill, but as a kid, I just remember feeling so embarrassed. And so now as an adult, I just have zero haggling ability and, you know, probably I'm worse off for it. How do we break those habits? So one of the things I illustrate in the book is one, acknowledging that you see that habit. So that's first. You can't break something that you don't acknowledge and see: what is the habit that I'm seeing in myself? Then, two, exploring where it came from. And so, bravo to you again, Andee for recognizing, 'OK, this is from Dad,' you know. And then three, practicing in a safe environment.  So what I would tell you, is don't worry about the financial haggling for now. You know, if you are not haggling financially, you might be someone that's uncomfortable with asking the waiter for extra cheese— Oh, one hundred percent. I can never send a sandwich back. Okay so that's a baby step. So it's like, sending something back or maybe just asking for something additional like, 'Oh can I also get that,' because what you want to do is you want to practice advocating for yourself. Because it's hard to jump into the financial application if you're not able to advocate for yourself in small, little ways.  That's great advice. I want to talk a little bit about mindful spending. Can you break down the different priorities people should be thinking about for us?  Absolutely. It's: Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? We already know needs: food, shelter, clothing, water. Things you must have to maintain your health and safety. Second, are your loves.  Loves will continue to give you joy six months to a year from now. Likes give you temporary joy, in under six months you might not remember. And wants are fleeting.  So what I want people to do is to lean into the first half of the equation, your needs and your loves. So you need to take care of your health and safety and loves that give you lasting joy, and less money toward likes and wants — not  no  money, but the more money you spend on likes and wants, the less money you have for needs and loves.  You tell this great story in the book and it's about saying no to brunch with your girlfriends for a very specific reason. Can you share that story with us?  Yes, so friends of mine would go to brunch every Sunday and it was maybe, say, 30 to 50 bucks every time. And one day I realized I wanted to go on vacation, but I didn't have any money.  And then when [my friend called] and was like, 'Hey, girl, you want to go to brunch?' I thought to myself, that's where my money is going! And I realized brunch is not a love for me because I don't even remember what we ate last week. I was spending my money on  her  loves.  Now, it's not her fault because she was doing what she was supposed to do, spend her money on her love. But she was convincing me to do so as well. So I stopped going and I almost made it like a drinking game. Every time somebody said \"brunch,\" I put that money in my savings account.  And then when I had enough,  I used it to go on my first solo trip. I wanted to go to Albuquerque because it's the hot air balloon capital of the world and I've never ridden a hot air balloon. And so now I learned that I'm not saying no to brunch, I'm saying yes to Morocco. I'm not saying no to brunch, I'm saying yes to India. I'm saying yes to Monaco. And so I always encourage people to do the same. I want you to use your money to live an actual richer, more joyful life. I want you to make sure you're not using your money towards someone else's idea of love.  So, Tiffany, you came from a household where you were talking about money all the time. But what about people where that where that wasn't the case? How can we get comfortable talking about money?   You're right. I think the average person did not have these conversations at home. So how do you naturally do that? You have to find a safe environment to do so. It might just be a group of your girlfriends where you've said, like, 'I would love you to be my accountability partner and I'm just going to talk about money with you.' And if you don't know anybody in your own physical real life, there are digital folks that you can lean into and virtual people that you can lean into.  I speak freely in front of my friends about money on purpose because I'm always trying to create a safe environment: 'I'm not going to judge; I don't know what's right or wrong for you, I'm just here to present you with as much knowledge as possible so you could choose the right choice for yourself.'  So make sure that when you're looking for these safe spaces, that that's the energy you get.  This piece originally published on March 28, 2021.

I'm Andee Tagle, one of the producers of the show, and today, we're going to talk about money. More specifically, we're going to talk feelings about money - hopes and fears, guilt and shame and the significant role they play in your financial life. Feeling uncomfortable yet? Good. Then we're in the same boat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: I've never been great with money, a trait I often blamed on being too busy or perpetually poor math skills or a weakness for convenience and good sample sales. But of course, my dilemma is more complex than just a bad relationship with algebra. TIFFANY ALICHE: Money is more mindset than coins, than dollars and coins. TAGLE: That's Tiffany Aliche. ALICHE: Much better known as the Budgetnista, I like to say I'm America's favorite financial educator - if not, at least your favorite financial educator. TAGLE: In addition to being one of LIFE KIT's favorite financial educators, Aliche is the author of the new book \"Get Good With Money.\" It's a super practical guide to getting your financial house in order to achieve what she calls financial wholeness in 10 steps. ALICHE: Budgeting, savings, debt, credit, learning to earn, investing, insurance, net worth, getting your financial team in place and estate planning. The first five are super, super, super foundational, and then the next five builds upon those first five. TAGLE: Her book dives deep into each one of these topics, but Aliche says this process begins with understanding your own financial identity and the many feelings and environmental forces that shape it. For Aliche, conversations about money have been front and center her whole life. ALICHE: Like, kids had Sweet 16s, but at 16, we walked to the bank down the street to open up our first joint bank account with my parents. And so I just grew up not having kind of, like, hang-ups about money because it was normal conversation. I was like, you guys don't have money talk Thursday nights? TAGLE: Not all of us might have been so lucky, but we can all, says Aliche, get good with money. We just have to get good with our feelings first. In this episode of LIFE KIT, tips for accessing your emotions around money and learning to strengthen your financial voice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: You talk about how you used to live in this state of financial fear, and you say that financial wholeness is the cure to that financial fear or to financial trauma. And I love that idea - financial wholeness. How do you define it? How do you define that term? Let's start there. ALICHE: So I define financial wholeness when all aspects of your financial life - and there's 10 that we lean into truly - so when all of these 10 aspects of your financial life are working congruently for what I like to call your greatest good, your biggest benefit and your richest life. TAGLE: Greatest good, biggest benefit, richest life. That's really smart. ALICHE: Yes. I would say financial freedom is for the few, but financial wholeness is for everyone. It doesn't matter how much you make. It doesn't matter what you do for a living. It doesn't matter how old you are. Financial wholeness can be achieved by everyone, and so it's just a holistic view of, like, what to do with my money and how to maximize and make the most of it. TAGLE: So financial wholeness is really about making sure you have a strong foundation for wherever you're at. ALICHE: Wherever you're at. TAGLE: Wherever you're at. It's not about being a millionaire. It's about just making sure, wherever you're at, you have an appropriate foundation. You have the appropriate, you know, pillars in place. ALICHE: Exactly, because from there, then you can build. What's so great about financial wholeness is that it is, like, the prerequisite to the rest of your financial life. If you get that solid foundation - like, I grew up with a solid foundation, so as a result, even though, like, I lost my first condo to foreclosure and I lost my job and I had this scam happen, I'm here and stronger than ever before because of that financial foundation. And now I pass that gift on to y'all through \"Get Good With Money.\" TAGLE: I want to talk a little bit about the emotions behind money. I loved what you had to say about money-messaging and being aware of the influences in our life that might affect our habits and our financial voice. I know in my own life, for example, I immediately thought about how my dad was always super, super frugal. You know, he asked for discounts wherever we went. That's a really valuable skill, but as a kid, I just remember feeling so embarrassed. Like, I just remember turning beet red. And so now as an adult, I just have zero haggling ability - just none at all - and, you know, probably, I'm worse off for it, you know? So how do we break those habits? ALICHE: So one of the things I illustrate in the book is that 1, bravo to you, Andee, for acknowledging that you see that habit. So that's first. You can't break something that you don't acknowledge and see. So teaching folks to see, 1, what is the habit that I'm seeing in myself, you know? Then 2, exploring where it came from. And so, like, bravo to you again, recognizing, like, oh, this is from dad, you know? And then 3, practicing in a safe environment. So what I would tell you, Andee, is that, like, OK, don't worry about, like, the financial haggling for now. You know, likely, if you are not haggling financially, you might be someone that's uncomfortable with, like, sharing with the waiter, actually, can I get extra cheese on my macaroni and cheese, right? TAGLE: A thousand percent. ALICHE: Right? So that's me, too, right? TAGLE: (Laughter). ALICHE: And so I would say, OK, it's a baby step. TAGLE: I can never send a sandwich back. ALICHE: Yeah. So it's like, sending something back - and not even sending something back - maybe just asking for something additional, like, oh, can I also get dot, dot, dot because what you're wanting to do is you want to practice advocating for yourself, you know, because it's hard to jump into the financial advocation, you know, for yourself if you're not able to advocate in small, little ways - so starting with a safe, simple practice and then leading your way up from there. TAGLE: And breaking these habits, you talk about, is in service of doing something you mention in the book, which is finding your financial voice. What is your financial voice, and how does someone go about finding their own? ALICHE: So your financial voice is - everyone has this internal voice as they're doing something. So if you're wanting to find your financial voice, I just want you today to - every time you make a financial choice, I want you to, like, do kind of like a heart check, you know, and ask yourself, what am I thinking? What am I feeling? I want you to practice pausing. Like, let's get Uber Eats. Pause for a moment and ask yourself, how am I thinking? How am I feeling about this? You know, am I thinking or feeling nothing, you know, which is fine? Or am I feeling a little anxious or a little guilty 'cause this is another Amazon purchase? Whatever that is, I want you to stop, pause, check and kind of mentally record for yourself. And then I want you to kind of get a pulse of, do you largely think about your financial choices positively or negatively? So this might actually - like, if you really find that you're having a hard time mentally with money, this, you might - a little notebook might really help because literally you might, you know - like, you might have a happy face on one side of the notebook and a sad face and literally just a checkmark. Like, oh, that was a positive thought - check. That was a negative thought - check. Because we're trying to get a gauge of, like, how are you with your finances, and what is your money message to yourself, and what is your voice? Is it a positive voice? Is it a neutral voice? Or is it a negative voice? And it's already there. You just want to tune in to listen to it, but you also want to actively work toward changing and transforming it to something more positive. TAGLE: That's great advice. Now, we've asked about this before, but I want to talk a little bit about mindful spending. Can you break down the different priorities people should be thinking about for us? ALICHE: Absolutely. It's do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? And so needs are - we already know - food, shelter, clothing, water. You must have to maintain your health and safety. Second are your loves. Loves give you joy - will continue to give you joy six months to a year from now. Likes give you temporary joy, so in under six months, you won't remember, right? So it's like, OK, you know, this thing is cool. So likes give you, like, that temporary joy. And wants, there's really no joy at all. So what I want people to do is to lean into, like, the first half of the equation - your needs and your loves. So your needs take care of your health and safety, and loves give you lasting joy - and less money toward likes and wants. Not no money, but the more money you spend on likes and wants, the less money you have for needs and loves. TAGLE: Great. I want to change gears a little bit. We had a listener question come in, and as soon as it came in, I thought of you. And you kind of address this in your book. I'm just going to read it for you. How do you budget your spending for the month when you're starting at zero dollars available? On the first of every month, I balance my checkbook by putting in my pay and entering all of my usual monthly bills, but by the time I subtract my monthly bills, I literally have zero dollars left for the month. I even have to transfer money from my savings into my checking account just to cover the bills, which leaves me with negative money. I don't ever buy coffee or eat out. How do you manage your income when you simply don't cover your expenses? And I know this is something that a lot of people are dealing with, you know, with the pandemic, with, you know, having all of these surprise emergency, you know, spendings. What do we do? What do people do in this situation? ALICHE: If most of your money, like this listener, is going to your financial obligations - like, maybe all of your money or actually more money than you actually have - then that means you have a don't make enough issue. I think if nothing else, this pandemic and quarantine has taught us that we all have to learn how to earn in multiple ways because some people's whole industry knocked out - the restaurant industry, movie industry. So learning to earn, but in the meantime - and this is what I had to learn. It was a hard thing, and it might be hard for you, listener, to hear - is that I had to drop down to what I call my health and safety budget. That is, what things on my list must I pay for to maintain my health and to maintain my safety? Everybody else had to wait. So I'm giving you permission to say, you know what, I need to prioritize myself before I prioritize my bills because if I'm not here, if I'm not healthy, if I'm not safe, who's going to pay them anyway? Nobody. TAGLE: I'm moving on a little bit to savings. You say we should save like a squirrel. ALICHE: Yes (laughter). TAGLE: And I really like that. How do we get squirrelly? Just, you know, big picture - how can we all get a little more squirrelly? ALICHE: This is what squirrels do. Work the hardest - they save the most. And when wintertime comes, squirrels - like, they hole up in their little tree, and they eat off of the - when they work the hardest, and they save the most. And so that's what we can be. Like, human beings are the opposite. When we get our raises, when we get our bonuses, it's like, drinks on me, drinks on me, you know? We tend to spend the most and be like, well, things are good. I don't need to work hard, you know? And then when financial winter comes, we're like - that's when we try to put the more work in, you know, but there's no work to be found. So that's how you get squirrely then. If you're experiencing financial abundance, lean into it. Like, you know, work a little bit harder if you're capable, but definitely save a little more because some of that - your financial acorns - are actually meant for your financial winter as well. TAGLE: I love that. You tell this great story in the book, and it's about saying no to brunch with your girlfriends for a very specific reason. Can you share that story with us? ALICHE: Yes. So friends of mine would go to brunch every Sunday. It was maybe like, say, 30 to 50 bucks every time. And one day, I realized I wanted to go on vacation, but I didn't have any money. And then when I was realizing it, she called and was like, hey, girl, you want to go to brunch? And I thought to myself, that's where my money is going. Like, did I - what did we even eat last week? And I realized brunch is not a love for me because I don't even remember what we had last week. She loved brunch. That was her love. I was spending my money on her loves. Now, it's not her fault because she was doing what she's supposed to do - spend her money on her love - but she was convincing me to do it as well. So I stopped going to brunch, and I almost made it, like, how you do, like, a drinking game. Every time somebody says Andee, you take a drink. But I said every time someone says brunch, I put that money in my savings account. That was my drinking game. And so every time they invite me to brunch, I would transfer 30 to 50 bucks to a savings account, and then when I had enough, I used it to go to my first solo trip. And so now I learned that I'm not saying no to brunch. I'm saying yes to Morocco. I'm not saying no to brunch. I'm saying yes to India. And these are real countries I've been to. I'm saying yes to Monaco. I'm saying yes to Italy. And so I always encourage people to do the same. I want you to use your money to live an actual richer, more joyful life. I want you to make sure you're not using your money towards someone else's idea of loves. To me, that's not the best use of your money. TAGLE: What especially spoke to me was that you said you learned how to say no in a different way. It wasn't just no, sorry, I'm busy. You didn't make excuses, you know? You changed your language. Can you give us some template language for how we might be able to change our language? You know, when those uncomfortable situations come, how can we say no to brunch too? ALICHE: So whatever it is that you're saving toward - 'cause I don't believe saving's just for saving's sake. You can save toward emergencies or save toward goals because saving towards saving's sake means that you probably are not enjoying as much life as you ought to, right? So if your emergency savings is fully funded - you got your six months, your year, your three months, whatever you think is necessary - great. You can say, you know, I would love to - you know, it sounds really awesome to go to dot, dot, dot or to go to the mall or whatever, but honestly, I'm saving toward sharing that amazing, dope thing because your friends and your family - they love you. And so that's really the language - identifying the thing that you're saving toward, your goal or emergency savings or otherwise, and then reiterating that language to the person that's asking you to spend, because I promise you, that positive language feels good to you and to them. You're not actually saying no to them 'cause what they hear is, oh, wow, Tiffany - Andee is saying yes to herself. She is saying yes to this awesome goal, not no to me. TAGLE: So Tiffany, you came from a household where you were talking about money all the time, but what about people where that wasn't the case? You know, how can we get comfortable talking about money? What can we say? What can we do? How can we start having those conversations? ALICHE: You're right. I think the average person did not have these conversations at home. So how do you naturally do that? So you have to find a safe environment to do so. It might just be a group of your girlfriends where you've said, like, you know, this is my - you know, I would love you to be my accountability partner, and I'm just going to talk about money with you. So finding a safe environment to do so, and if you don't know anybody in your own physical real life, that there are digital folks that you could lean into and virtual people that you can lean into. I speak freely in front of my friends about money on purpose because I'm always trying to create a safe environment. I'm not going to judge. For me, I don't know what's right or wrong for you. The educator in me is just merely here to present you with as much knowledge as possible so you could choose the right choice for yourself. So make sure that when you're looking for these safe spaces, that that's the energy you get. TAGLE: So I'm hearing seek out a safe space. It doesn't necessarily have to be your family or your household. And also, you know, destigmatize it. Like, don't be scared to talk about it, normalize it. It's OK to talk about dollar amounts. It's OK to talk about salaries. Familiarize yourself first as you need. Dip your toe in first. ALICHE: Yeah, dip that little pinky toe in. (LAUGHTER) TAGLE: Tiffany Aliche, the Budgetnista, thank you so much for joining us. This has been wonderful. ALICHE: This has been awesome, Andee. It's always a good time with you. Thank you for having me back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, let's recap what we've learned. Money is so much more than dollars and cents. Our relationship with money is emotional, and those feelings are tied to lots of things - your upbringing, your environment, plus, you know, all the money-messaging in the world and the media. Learn to hone your financial voice by first being aware of the money influences in your own life, then take time to examine your financial decision-making. Do you feel mostly good or mostly guilty about your choices? Track your feelings if you're not totally sure where you're at. If you want to change a habit, start small and practice in a safe environment. Maybe enlist a friend to be your accountability partner. Next, be more mindful of your spending by differentiating between your purchases. ALICHE: Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? TAGLE: Remember, a no to a like can and should be reframed as a yes to a love. Your friends and family will understand, and they might just be inspired to do the same. Finally, you can work towards financial wholeness by just talking about it more. Seek out safe spaces with your people or online, and ask the questions you want to ask. Air out your grievances. The more money conversations are out there, the less they're stigmatized, the more empowered we all are. It's just good sense.

survival story — and one of the year's most gripping films \n         By Justin Chang \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:25 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Fresh Air \n        \n      \n\n         The Arabic word  sirāt  means \"path\" or \"way\"; in Islamic scripture, it refers to a narrow bridge that connects Paradise and Hell. That makes it a fitting title for the director Oliver Laxe's new movie, which is both exhilarating and devastating.  Sirāt  is a survival story about several unlikely traveling companions making their way through a godforsaken stretch of the Sahara Desert. It carries echoes of countless earlier films, from the arid landscapes of a John Ford Western to the post-apocalyptic setting of  Mad Max . But nothing about  Sirāt  feels derivative or secondhand. It's an astonishing piece of cinema; I haven't had a more gripping experience in a movie theater all year. It begins somewhere in southern Morocco, where hundreds of nomadic European revelers have gathered for a rave. It seems that World War III or something like it has broken out, though the specifics are left vague. Whatever's going on,  Sirāt  initially plays like a party at the end of the world: Imagine a remake of the recent dystopian thriller  Civil War  set at  Burning Man , and you'll have some idea. Laxe, a French-born, Spanish director, sweeps you up in the intense physicality of the dancing and the propulsive beat of the music, composed by the experimental electronic musician Kangding Ray. Wandering around this unruly desert bacchanal is a middle-aged man named Luis, played by the Spanish actor Sergi López. This clearly isn't Luis' scene. Along with his young son Esteban and their dog, Luis is searching for his 20-something daughter, Mar, who vanished months ago, and whom he has reason to suspect is among the ravers.  But she's nowhere to be found, and before long, armed officials show up and, invoking a state of emergency, break up the party. Amid the ensuing chaos, five ravers drive off, bound for another rave further south. Luis and Esteban impulsively drive after them, hoping against hope that they'll find Mar. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Laxe's previous films, including the 2016 drama  Mimosas , which also chronicled a perilous journey through Morocco, he has worked mainly with non-professional actors. With the exception of López, that's also true here. The director recruited most of the principal cast from raves that he himself attended, and they're all naturals. I especially liked Stefania Gadda as a woman of few words but immense screen presence, and Jade Oukid as a dancer of mesmerizing ability. You feel for these off-the-grid daredevils, and you admire their survival tactics during what will prove to be an exceedingly dangerous trek. While the ravers have an enormous truck and a camper van, Luis and Esteban are in a small van that's ill-equipped for the treacherous terrain. But the ravers, somewhat reluctantly at first, let them tag along. They all share their limited resources, including food, water and gas. And they help each other out, when Luis has trouble fording a small river, or when the truck gets stuck on a steep mountain road.  Sirāt  is a visually and sonically overwhelming experience; it's full of majestic desert vistas and propelled by that thrillingly percussive score. It's also a drama of extraordinary tension and, eventually, shocking tragedy, in which death has a way of striking when you least expect it. I was often reminded of  The Wages of Fear  and  Sorcerer , two classic nail-biters, both adapted from a Georges Arnaud novel about a road trip from hell. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       What separates  Sirāt  from those two films, though, is its lack of cynicism. López is terrific as a father whose child has disappeared and who's understandably wary and mistrustful of the world. But even at his bleakest moments, Luis receives unexpected acts of compassion from his new companions.  At one point, Esteban asks one of the ravers if he misses his family, while traveling on the road, and the raver responds, \"I prefer this family.\" That might sound like something Vin Diesel would say in a  Fast and Furious  movie, and as it happens, Diesel's driving skills might have come in handy here. But Laxe's film is as sincere in its tenderness as it is unrelenting in its ferocity. There's something powerful about the movie's belief that, even as an apocalypse looms, kindness can survive and meaningful relationships can form. Just because the world is pitiless,  Sirāt  suggests, doesn't mean that people have to be. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604667","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Dear Life Kit: I'm tall.

Dear Life Kit, I'm a six-foot-tall woman, and both complete strangers and new acquaintances often make comments like, 'Wow, you're tall.' Some people say I should take it as a compliment, but it makes me feel like a spectacle. I don't want to normalize the comments, but I also don't want to embarrass the commenters. How can I respond? —  More than my height   Brittany Luse:  I appreciate the fact that you don't want to embarrass people. I want to offer the idea of maybe not 100% embarrassment or even 60% embarrassment, but a nice, gritty little 15% embarrassment. You can respond with, 'Oh my gosh, you're the first person to tell me that.' Give them a little giggle. Give them the opportunity to laugh with you, but they know you're not playing. And if they don't take the hint the first time, you can be direct. 'Is this catching your attention so much that you have to say something right now?' I think you can give someone one pass with a little joke to let them know you don't like it. And then after that, be really direct. Adia Gooden:  I agree.  If people continue to cross this boundary, be more serious about it. You can say, 'It's not cool. I'm not comfortable with it. Please stop.' If somebody feels a little embarrassed and realizes they shouldn't have said that, that's OK. You're not saying they're an awful person, but you're communicating that what they did is problematic. They should feel a little taste of it so that they stop. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dear Life Kit, I've been with my boyfriend for seven years. I'm starting to feel pressure from family members and friends to settle down and have a wedding. We're planning to get married, but we want to wait until we are more financially secure. How can I let people know we're not in a hurry to get married without being rude? —  Not in a hurry Gooden:  If people are coming from a loving place, just say, 'We're being really intentional about how we want to start the next chapter of our lives together. Weddings are expensive. We don't want to start our lives together in debt or going into debt.' Luse:   When I was in a similar situation, I would say, 'If you've got tens of thousands of dollars that you want to give me, go right ahead.' Or the other, mildly gentler, response, 'I don't have any updates to share right now, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.' Which is what I say now when people ask me about having children. Gooden:  [If a lighter touch doesn't work,] you can just say, 'Please stop asking us. It's kind of frustrating when you keep asking us about our plans. We will be sure to let you know when we are going in that direction, but until then, please respect our decision-making.' \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dear Life Kit, My future sister-in-law often says things that are hurtful or judgmental. She once told me, 'I love you, but you're too self-absorbed to own a dog.' And this was over a meal that I brought over for her. I've had pets, raised my younger sister and taken care of my sick mom. I don't think most people would consider me self-absorbed. Her comments bring my fiancé and me down. I've begun avoiding her. How can I cope in a healthy way and still have a relationship with her? —  Feeling frozen? Gooden:  This might be a situation where you need to recognize when someone's comments are not about you. If you know that you're not self-absorbed, then you shouldn't let somebody's comment derail you or override what you know to be true about yourself. So, how do you stay grounded in who you are? You need to discern whose opinion you're going to take and whose opinion you're going to leave. If your wise grandma says, 'Hey, it seems like you've been focusing on yourself a little too much, and I want you to think about this.' That might be different than a comment from a sister-in-law who tends to make judgmental comments. She may be somebody whose opinion you're going to ignore. You may also need to set some boundaries. For example, 'Hey, I feel judged when you give me advice. So I prefer that not to be part of our relationship.' Luse:  At the end of the day, this is your fiancé's sister, and I wonder if he could play a bigger role in managing your relationship with her as a couple. It sounds like maybe he's also feeling the impact of her judgment. I'll share something my therapist said to me once when I was navigating a difficult relationship: 'Have you ever considered that this person may never change? I want you to consider that, and then think about how you want to conduct yourself going forward.' You can't control her. You can only control how and when you interact with her, to a certain degree.

Amid the rubble sits a boulder the size of a cargo truck that arrived with the avalanche that buried Armero on Nov. 13 th , 1985. The deluge was caused by the eruption of snowcapped Nevado del Ruiz volcano 30 miles west of town. Warnings to evacuate arrived too late. The flood of lava, mud and debris killed 25,000 people. Angarita was climbing a tree to escape when he was caught by the massive mudslide. It carried him nearly four miles out of town before he could crawl to safety. He suffered 16 fractures to his face and jaw and compared the experience to being inside a blender. Angarita, who is now 71, says: \"I have no idea why I'm still alive.\" This week, Colombians are marking the 40 th  anniversary of the Armero tragedy with solemn ceremonies and renewed efforts to clarify what's become of town residents who went missing. \"Armero is a part of Colombian history. It was the worst natural disaster in Latin America with a huge number of victims,\" said  Maurcio Cuéllar , a survivor of the tragedy and mayor of the nearby town of Guayabal where many Armero residents resettled. Although Nevado del Ruíz is a highly active volcano, there were few warnings ahead of the 1985 eruption. The lava melted part of the snowcap and created a massive mudslide that flowed down a river valley where Armero was located.  Many residents were glued to their TV sets for a big soccer match and had no idea something was wrong until the lights went out at about 9:30pm and they heard a roar. \"The sound was like a whole bunch of helicopters in the sky,\" said Marco Rivera, who was 18 at the time and found refuge behind the sturdy gate of the town's cemetery. \"Lights were flashing in the dark because the mudslide swallowed up cars with their lights on and they were flipping over and over.\" Armero, once home to 29,000 residents, was never rebuilt. These days tour guides lead people through a wasteland of half-buried buildings and makeshift gravestones. Asthar Vreeswijk, a Dutch tourist, found Armero more moving than the petrified ruins of Pompeii. \"If you're going to visit a place like this in Europe, it's totally structured and like renovated. You don't feel that it happened for real,\" she said. \"But here, everything it's like how it was. So, it's quite powerful.\" The biggest attraction is a shrine to Omayra Sánchez. Only 13, she was found by rescue workers in water up to her neck and trapped by the debris of her family's ruined house. As they tried to save her, she spoke to  TV journalists . \"Mommy, if you can hear me, pray so that I can walk again and that these people can help me,\" she said. After spending 70 hours in the water, Sánchez died of hypothermia. Many Colombians now view her as a kind of saint and at her gravesite they've placed hundreds of stone plaques thanking her for the blessings they believe she's bestowed upon them. If Nevado del Ruíz erupts again Colombia should be better prepared. Amid criticism of the belated and uncoordinated rescue efforts 40 years ago, the government created a special  agency  to respond to disasters while early warning systems have been installed in several towns near the volcano. Meanwhile, the search for possible missing persons continues. Survivors reported a total of 583 missing children, says Francisco González, an Armero native who is leading an investigation into what happened to them. He acknowledges that many of these children likely perished in the landslide. Others were quickly adopted. However, chaos reigned after the landslide, record-keeping was shoddy, and the fate of these children may never be known. Even so, the Colombian government's child welfare agency, which handles adoptions, has pledged to open its records and archives to try to clarify what happened. Adriana Tierradentro, one of the agency's directors, told NPR: \"We will provide all the information that we can.\" In a symbolic search for truth, relatives of the missing launched hundreds of model boats into a river near Armero. Their tiny sails were emblazoned with photos of the missing. Among them is the younger brother of Mariela Díaz. Every year, she makes a pilgrimage back to her hometown of Armero to look for him. \"My brother  did  survive. Lots of people saw him. A doctor saw a photo of him and told me that he treated him,\" Díaz says. \"So, we still have hope that, maybe, he will reappear.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Forty years ago today, a volcanic eruption in Colombia caused an avalanche that killed 25,000 people in the town of Armero.

OTIS: Later, Angarita points to a boulder the size of a cargo truck. It arrived with the avalanche on the evening of November 13, 1985. The deluge was caused by the eruption of snow-capped Nevado del Ruiz volcano, 30 miles west of here. Warnings to evacuate arrived too late. The flood of lava, mud and debris buried this once bustling farm town. ANGARITA: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Angarita was caught by the massive mudslide that carried him nearly 4 miles out of town. He suffered 16 fractures to his face and jaw and compares it to being inside a blender. ANGARITA: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Angarita, who's now 71, says, I have no idea why I'm still alive. UNIDENTIFIED TOUR GUIDE: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: These days, tour guides lead people through a wasteland of half-buried buildings and makeshift gravestones. Asthar Vreeswijk, who's from the Netherlands, found Armero more moving than the petrified ruins of Pompeii. ASTHAR VREESWIJK: If you go to visit a place like this in Europe, totally structured and, like, renovated, you don't feel real - that it happened for real. But here it's like everything is how it was, so it's quite powerful. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OMAYRA SANCHEZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: The biggest attraction is a shrine to Omayra Sanchez. Only 13, she was found by rescue workers in water up to her neck and trapped by debris. As they tried to save her, she spoke to TV journalists. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OMAYRA: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: \"Mommy,\" she says, \"if you can hear me, pray so that I can walk again and that these people can help me.\" After spending 70 hours in the water, Sanchez died of hypothermia. Many Colombians consider Omayra Sanchez an unofficial saint. And here at her gravesite, they've placed hundreds of stone plaques, thanking her for the blessings they believe that she's bestowed upon them. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Four decades later, there are still many unanswered questions about the tragedy. For example, Nevado del Ruiz was a highly active volcano, and it's unclear why there were so few warnings ahead of the catastrophic eruption. FRANCISCO GONZALEZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Five hundred eighty-three children are reported by relatives as unaccounted for, says Francisco Gonzalez  an Armero native who is leading an investigation into what happened to them. Many likely perished in the landslide. Others were adopted. However, chaos reigned after the disaster. Record-keeping was shoddy, and the fate of these children may never be known. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: To mark the 40th anniversary of the tragedy, survivors launch hundreds of model boats into a nearby river in a symbolic search for truth. Their tiny sails are emblazoned with photos of the missing children. About half of the little boats immediately overturn in the rapids, but the rest of them seem to be staying upright. Surviving. MARIELA DIAZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Among the missing is the younger brother of Mariela Diaz. Every year, she makes a pilgrimage back to her hometown of Armero to look for him. DIAZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: \"My brother did survive. Lots of people saw him,\" Diaz says, \"so we still have hope that maybe he will reappear.\" For NPR News, I'm John Otis in Armero, Colombia. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5321366","dateOfPublication":"2025-04-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The delightfully analog art of letter-writing","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rachel Syme, a New Yorker staff writer, revived the art of letter-writing during the pandemic by creating a penpal program called PenPalooza after receiving 300 social media responses.

     \n        \n      \n\n         The art of letter writing is not dead. Rachel Syme, a  New Yorker  staff writer, learned that during the early days of the pandemic. Longing for human connection, she asked her followers on social media if anyone wanted to be her pen pal. \"I got 300 responses,\" she says. She couldn't possibly write to everyone, so she created a letter-exchanging program called  PenPalooza  to \"connect all these people to one another.\" It now has more than 10,000 members. Those efforts kickstarted a letter-writing routine that Syme says continues to bring her great joy. \"I'm constantly being surprised by what shows up in my mailbox. Creative expressions, intimacies, honesty and beautiful writing.\" They also inspired her to write  Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence , published in January. The book offers tips on how to find a penpal and   write a delightful dispatch — and includes letters from famous writers like Octavia Butler and Zelda Fitzgerald for inspiration. Syme shares practical and whimsical advice on how to start an epistolary habit. ❓You don't need to look too far to find a penpal.  Start with family and friends. If you're looking to get to know new people, ask your social media followers if they want a letter from you. Make a post along the lines of, \"Hey, I'd love to write you a letter,\" and see what kind of response you get, Syme says. \"You'd be surprised how far that will take you.\" 🌨️ Don't be afraid to write about the weather.  A lot of people begin their letters with the weather and apologize because they think it's a \"boring\" topic, Syme says — but talking about the sunshine or the rain showers can be very telling. According to South African novelist Bessie Head, whom Syme quotes in her book, \"The mood of the weather began to explain many other things for me. I think the mind picks on anything to explain the brooding of the heart.\" 🗓️ Letters don't always have to be life updates.  Try a writing prompt instead, Syme says. What's your favorite life hack? What was your most extravagant impulse purchase? Or get creative. Draw a map of a stroll you often take through your neighborhood, with descriptions of your favorite memories in each place. Make your own Mad Libs for the recipient to fill out. You can also skip writing and send Polaroids of snapshots from your life, or personal recipes. 🎁 Sneak gifts into your letters.  Think of flat things you can fit into your envelope, like stickers, pressed flowers, tea bags, paper incense, lottery tickets and iron-on patches, Syme says. Just make sure you're not mailing matchbooks or other prohibited items. You can find a full list  here . 📜 The sky's the limit when it comes to paper.  Syme has used postcards, vintage hotel stationery and pink legal paper (\"because Jacqueline Susann, who wrote  Valley of the Dolls , always wrote on pink notepads,\" she says) to write letters. Other unexpected options: paper napkins, recycled paper from work or tissue paper from a gift bag. ✨ Consider a typewriter.  Syme says if your wrists need a break, you have poor handwriting or just want to avoid screens in this process, a typewriter can help. \"Once you feel the keys crunch under your fingers, it's hard to go back.\" 📸 Take photos of the letters you send.  When you write letters, you're creating an archive, Syme says. But \"what's funny is you can't really see the archive you're creating together with the person you wrote letters to.\" So Syme says you might consider snapping photos of your letters to keep a personal record of your correspondence. 🌇  Some correspondences may fade away, and that's OK.  While writing a letter to someone can feel exciting at first, and a correspondence may last months, years or even a lifetime, inevitably they will come to an end, Syme says. Relationships change over time, and there's no point in being penpals if one or both parties aren't fully committed to it. If you don't hear from someone, remember that \"correspondence is a leap of faith, and that is part of what makes it wonderful,\" Syme says. \"You may never know if the person you are writing to will write you back.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

    By Zane Irwin \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 3:21 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In September, Kansas Republican leaders  said they wanted to join  the national redistricting battle, initiated by President Trump, for control of the U.S. House. But even in a state that went for Trump by 16 percentage points in 2024, Republicans could not rally enough support this fall for a special session on redistricting. \"I haven't heard a good reason yet to vote for it,\" said Mark Schreiber, one of 10 Republican holdouts in the Kansas state House. \"To me that's not the purpose of redistricting. It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority, it's to adjust for population changes.\" Other Republican-led states — like  Missouri ,  North Carolina  and  Texas  — have heeded Trump's call for new congressional maps boosting the GOP. Last week, California voters  approved new districts  favoring Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Kansas' false start was just one example of lawmakers pushing back against a new round of partisan gerrymanders. On Friday afternoon, Indiana's state Senate president  announced  there wasn't enough support for redistricting among the chamber's Republicans. Democrats in Maryland have faced scorn from party leaders for speaking out against proposed redraws. And in Ohio, where many expected Republicans to enact a severe gerrymander,  a bipartisan deal  resulted in a map that moderately advantaged the GOP. Why do some lawmakers oppose redistricting that would help their party? Lawmakers' reasons for bucking their party leaders appear to vary widely, including those who object to gerrymandering on philosophical grounds — and some who simply fear the maneuvers could backfire. \"The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state,\" said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Miller said some states, like New York and Colorado, have filing deadlines for congressional candidates that place an impossibly short timeline on potential redistricting efforts, given the steps needed in the states to craft a new map. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana raised eyebrows at the six-figure sums required to pay legislators outside of a regular session. Republican leaders in Kansas also faced a unique challenge. The state GOP would need to marshal nearly the full strength of its supermajorities in the state House and Senate to override a veto from the Democratic governor. Overall, Miller said, opposition to redistricting has not necessarily come from a place of righteous objection to gerrymandering. \"I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about … redistricting,\" Miller said. \"But I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all.\" Kansas state Rep. Clark Sanders said gerrymandering is a \"fact of life\" in politics. But he opposed hastily redrawing Kansas' 3rd District — held by the state's lone Democrat in Congress, Sharice Davids — because he thought it could backfire on Republicans. \"If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the 2nd District,\" he said. Sanders said he expressed the same concern when he received a call from the White House several weeks ago, to talk about redistricting. Last week, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped Sanders of a leadership position for refusing to sign off on a special session. He was one of seven committee chairs and vice chairs who were demoted for failing to toe the party line on redistricting. \"It's unfortunate that we lost our positions,\" Sanders said. \"We just … felt like we needed to do what we needed to do.\" Similar objections have sparked infighting in other states. Maryland's state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, has stood in opposition to his governor by publicly opposing redistricting. Ferguson  has argued  a legal challenge could place redistricting in the hands of the conservative-leaning state Supreme Court — resulting in new maps that hurt Democrats, rather than giving them a leg up. \"Ready to ride\" Despite those setbacks, redistricting proponents in several states are still trying to convince holdouts — under the watchful eyes of the national parties. Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore  recently formed  a redistricting advisory commission, despite state Sen. Ferguson's pushback.  And Kansas Republican leaders have  vowed to put maps before lawmakers  when their regular session begins in January. \"I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,\" House Speaker Hawkins wrote in a newsletter after his chamber rejected a special session. When lawmakers return to Topeka early next year, he said, \"House Republicans will be ready to ride.\" Even some holdouts in Kansas, like Republican state Rep. Adam Smith, said they had not ruled out the possibility of voting to redistrict in the future. \"If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97864","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:13:00-05:00","title":"Judge Approves $7 Billion Opioid Settlement with Purdue and Sackler Family","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal bankruptcy court judge, Sean Lane, has approved a $7 billion settlement between Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, resolving decades-long lawsuits over the opioid crisis linked to over 900,000 U.S. deaths since 1999.

settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue and Sackler family \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 3:13 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NEW YORK — A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic. The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years. The new agreement replaces one the U.S. Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl. Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars. Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could \"conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.\" But without that possibility, he said: \"The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.\" The opposition is much quieter this time around The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote. Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse. A handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing. A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough. \"The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\" Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video. Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago. Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There's no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven't had a say. Besides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing. The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026. Family members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities. Company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public. Some people hurt by Purdue's opioids would receive some money Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal. All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive. One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder. \"Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,\" asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York. Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. \"Some Sacklers are bad people,\" he said, \"but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.\" Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/ammonia-gas-leak-oklahoma-81319108b4556f17a5a324f5f29be1f6","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:14:02+00:00","title":"Ammonia Gas Leak from Tanker Truck in Oklahoma Sickens Dozens and Forces Evacuations","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaking tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in Weatherford, Oklahoma, released toxic gas overnight, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of residents, including those in nursing homes and schools.

(AP) — A leaking tanker truck spewed dangerous ammonia gas outside a hotel overnight, filling its hallways with fumes and forcing hundreds of nearby residents of a small Oklahoma city to evacuate, authorities said Thursday. Several dozen people were treated at hospitals. Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak. An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor. Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said.

Follow on Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers. Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said. At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day. A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds (11,340 kilograms) of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes. Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago, five people died in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan. The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles (115 kilometers) west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said. “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials. The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.” The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said. Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard. Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety. Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said. Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part. I know it’s your house, but you really have to go.” ___ McCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire, and Brumfield reported from Cockeysville, Maryland.

(AP) — A judge declined Thursday to throw out the criminal case against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting federal agents during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey. McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution. U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress. The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on another of one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges. McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong. “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.

McIver has pleaded not guilty and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision pending. McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison. Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring. McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened. Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest. It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident. A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped. Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill spelling out that authority. McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608004","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:41:00-04:00","title":"BBC Apologizes for Edit of Trump Speech but Says It Won’t Provide Legal Compensation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC issued a personal apology to President Donald Trump for a misleading edit in its documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' that falsely implied he called for violent action during his January 6, 2021, speech.

Trump speech but says it won't provide legal compensation \n         By Willem Marx \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 6:41 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         LONDON — Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, has issued a personal apology to President Trump over a misleading edit of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech in a documentary broadcast on its  Panorama  series. But the BBC has firmly rejected a demand from Trump's legal team for compensation. His personal attorneys  threatened a $1 billion defamation lawsuit  unless the BBC retracts the program, apologizes and pays for causing him to \"suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a letter to the White House released late Thursday, BBC Chair Samir Shah said he and the corporation were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech,\" acknowledging that the way the footage was spliced created \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" But despite the apology, the letter made clear it does not concede the defamation claim. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the corporation said.  The documentary — titled  Trump: A Second Chance?  — was commissioned by the BBC from an external production company and aired shortly before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together separate parts of Trump's speech on the day of the Capitol riots, even though the excerpts came from moments almost an hour apart. Critics argued that the edit misrepresented the president's words, especially by omitting a section where he had called for peaceful protest.  Swift, public consequences In its retraction, the BBC accepted that the editing \"unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech … and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" The broadcaster also announced it had no plans to rebroadcast the episode. The legal threat from an incumbent U.S. president has triggered serious fallout at the BBC. Director-General Tim Davie and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness both  resigned in the wake of the controversy . In a message to staff, Davie admitted \"we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach,\" but also urged them to defend the BBC's journalism under growing pressure. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The British government has also been drawn into the debate. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy defended the broadcaster in Parliament this week, highlighting its importance at a time of political polarization and widespread misinformation.  \"It is by far the most widely used and trusted source of news in the United Kingdom,\" she told fellow lawmakers. \"At a time when the lines are being dangerously blurred between fact and opinion, news and polemic, the BBC stands apart.\" A legally complex case The president's lawyers have threatened to file suit in Florida, but legal experts note that it could be difficult for Trump to argue reputational damage in the U.S. since the documentary did not air in the country widely, so it may be challenging to prove Americans watched and were influenced by the film. Still, the dispute has stirred a broader debate about the BBC's role and accountability.  Critics fear that, if forced to pay out, the BBC could be using public funds to settle with a foreign head of state.  For many in the United Kingdom, this touches on national pride and the public broadcaster's mission to inform and educate, not to be dragged into costly legal battles. If the case proceeds, it could cost millions in legal fees, even if the BBC ultimately wins, and media lawyers say the public nature of pretrial disclosures could have a huge cost to the broadcaster's reputation. Opposition from the British public Established over a century ago and operating under a Royal Charter, the BBC is funded almost entirely through a TV license fee that is paid by most U.K. households.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Its reporting has shaped the national understanding and perception of wars, elections, royal events and major cultural moments, meaning the lawsuit has touched a cultural nerve for many Britons.  That was sharply articulated during a BBC radio phone-in earlier this week.  One caller,  identifying himself only as Simon  from the southwest town of Truro, warned he would not support public funds reimbursing the former U.S. president.  \"If we have to pay a penny to Trump, then I'm sorry — I'm not going to pay my TV license,\" he said. \"The world just seems to be frightened of him. I think the BBC needs to stand up to him.\" Media analysts say this reaction reflects how entwined the BBC is with British national identity. \"The idea that an American president would sue the British broadcaster, paid for by British taxpayers — sue for a billion dollars for a 12-second edit of a speech he made is pretty astonishing,\" says Jane Martinson, a columnist for the  Guardian  newspaper and journalism professor at London's City University. Martinson also says Trump's latest threat repeated a pattern of trying to exploit existing dissatisfaction — in this case that stems from the BBC's coverage of other issues, like Gaza, gender rights and British politics.  \"It's about sowing dissent on the very nature of accuracy and impartiality.\" A broadcasting giant Stewart Purvis, a former CEO of major news network ITN and once an official at the U.K.'s media regulator, said the BBC plays a role unmatched elsewhere.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The BBC is the most consumed broadcast media outlet in the U.K. It's almost like combining two or even three of the American networks,\" Purvis told NPR.  \"You know, everybody loves the BBC in some way, but everyone has something to complain about, about the BBC.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The BBC - the British Broadcasting Corporation - apologized to President Trump for a documentary about the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. What it doesn't want to do is pay him. Willem Marx reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The London station of the British Broadcasting Company calling. WILLEM MARX: For more than a century, the BBC has been the voice of Britain, broadcasting comedies and crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We are at war. MARX: Monarch speeches and musical performances. The public funds it through a TV license fee. And written in its royal charter, its mission is to inform, educate and entertain. But there's little to laugh about as this U.K. institution prepares for a potential lawsuit from a U.S. president. Donald Trump's billion-dollar legal threat accuses the BBC of defamation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to walk down to the Capitol. MARX: For juxtaposing in a documentary two separate parts of a speech Trump made on January 6. The broadcasters acknowledged the editing was misleading. Trump's ultimatum, though, touched a national nerve for some, including a BBC radio guest called Simon (ph), who gave just his first name. SIMON: If we have to pay a penny to Trump, then I'm sorry, I'm not going to pay my TV license. The world just seems to be frightened of him. I think the BBC needs to stand up to him. MARX: Media commentators like Jane Martinson, a journalism professor at London's City University, says this case is not just about impartial reporting but also national pride. JANE MARTINSON: The idea that an American president would sue the British broadcaster paid for by British taxpayers is pretty astonishing. MARX: For despite its global reach, the BBC remains deeply British and loved, says Stewart Purvis, the former CEO of the BBC's biggest rival. STEWART PURVIS: It's almost like combining one or two or even three of the American networks. Everybody loves the BBC in some way, but everyone has something to complain about about the BBC. MARX: Government minister Lisa Nandy told Parliament this week it plays a crucial role in the country's cultural and democratic life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LISA NANDY: At a time when the lines are being dangerously blurred between fact and opinion, news and polemic, the BBC stands apart.

2025-11-13T20:48:54+00:00\n\nSEATTLE (AP) — First-term Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell conceded his reelection fight to progressive activist Katie Wilson on Thursday, handing another victory to leftist Democrats around the country frustrated with unaffordability, homelessness, public safety and the actions of President Donald Trump’s administration. Harrell, a centrist Democrat who previously served three terms on the City Council, led in early results. But Washington conducts all-mail elections, with ballots postmarked by Election Day. Later-arriving votes, which historically trend more liberal, broke heavily in Wilson’s favor, adding to a progressive shift to the left nationally . In a concession speech at City Hall on Thursday afternoon, Harrell said he had congratulated Wilson in a “delightful” call. “I feel very good about the future of this country and this city still,” he said. Wilson, 43, is a democratic socialist who has never held elected office. She told a news conference later Thursday that it was hard for her to believe she had been elected mayor, considering that at the beginning of this year she had no intention of running, and she acknowledged concerns about her lack of experience: “No one saw this coming.” Related Stories Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell faces a hard reelection fight against progressive activist Katie Wilson 3 MIN READ But she also spoke to the resonance of her volunteer-driven campaign among voters concerned about affordability and public safety in a city where the cost of living has soared as Amazon and other tech companies proliferated. Universal child care, better mass transit, better public safety and stable, affordable housing are among her priorities, and she said she would take office with a strong mandate to purse them, though she acknowledged the city also faces a significant budget shortfall. Wilson called herself a coalition builder and community organizer, and said she would also work with those who questioned her qualifications to lead a city with more than 13,000 employees and a budget of nearly $9 billion: “This is your city too.” “When I say this is your city, that means you have a right to be here and to live a dignified life — whatever your background, whatever your income,” Wilson said. “But it also means that we all have a collective responsibility for this city and for each other. ... We cannot tackle the major challenges facing our city unless we do it together.” She will be working with a relatively new City Council: Only two of the seven council members have served more than one term. Harrell was elected mayor in 2021 following the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests over George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police. With crime falling, more police being hired, less visible drug use and many homeless encampments removed from city parks, the business-backed Harrell once seemed likely to cruise to reelection. But Trump’s return to office — and his efforts to send in federal agents or cut funding for blue cities — helped reawaken Seattle’s progressive voters. The lesser-known Wilson, a democratic socialist, ran a campaign that echoed some of the themes of progressive mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York. She trounced Harrell by nearly 10 percentage points in the August primary and quickly became favored to win the mayor’s office. Wilson studied at an Oxford University college in England but did not graduate. She founded the small nonprofit Transit Riders Union in 2011 and has led campaigns for better public transportation, higher minimum wages, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing. She herself is a renter, living in a one-bedroom apartment in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, and says that has shaped her understanding of Seattle’s affordability crisis . Wilson criticized Harrell as doing too little to provide more shelter and said his encampment sweeps have been cosmetic, merely pushing unhoused people around the city. Wilson also painted him as a City Hall fixture who bore responsibility for the status quo. Harrell, 67, played on the Rose Bowl champion University of Washington football team in 1978 before going to law school. His father, who was Black, came to Seattle from the segregated Jim Crow South, and his mother, a Japanese American, was incarcerated at an internment camp in Minidoka, Idaho , during World War II after officials seized her family’s Seattle flower shop — experiences that fostered his understanding of the importance of civil rights and inclusivity. Both candidates touted plans for affordable housing, combating crime and attempting to Trump-proof the city, which receives about $150 million a year in federal funding. Both want to protect Seattle’s sanctuary city status. Wilson has proposed a city-level capital gains tax to help offset federal funding the city might lose and to pay for housing. Harrell says that idea is ineffective because a city capital gains tax could easily be avoided by those who would be required to pay it."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-firing-pulte-data-a4f8c53df74fef83ec7fd07e3d524746","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"23:26:58Z","title":"Fannie Mae Data Leak Sparks Regulatory Scandal as Pulte’s Influence Draws Fire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A confidential data leak from Fannie Mae to its rival Freddie Mac, orchestrated by Lauren Smith under the direction of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration’s top housing regulator, has sparked a major scandal.

data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor, alarming senior officials of the government-backed lending giant who warned it could expose the company to claims that it was colluding with a rival to fix mortgage rates. Emails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Fannie Mae executives were unnerved about what one called the “very problematic” disclosure of data by Lauren Smith, the company’s head of marketing, who was acting on Pulte’s behalf. “Lauren, the information that was provided to Freddie Mac in this email is a problem,” Malloy Evans, senior vice president of Fannie Mae’s single-family mortgage division, wrote in an Oct. 11 email. “That is confidential, competitive information.” He also copied Fannie Mae’s CEO, Priscilla Almodovar, on the email, which bore the subject line: “As Per Director Pulte’s Ask.” Evans asked Fannie Mae’s top attorney “to weigh in on what, if any, steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves now.” While Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late last month, along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies. Housing industry rattled by dismissals The dismissals rattled the housing industry and drew condemnation from Democrats. It also gave Pulte’s critics evidence to support claims that he has leveraged the nonpublic information available to him to further his own political aims. “This is another example of Bill Pulte weaponizing his role to do Donald Trump’s bidding, instead of working to lower costs amidst a housing crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. “His behavior raises significant questions, and he needs to be brought in front of Congress to answer them.” The episode marks the latest example of Pulte using what is typically a low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy to enhance his own standing and gain the attention of President Trump. He’s prompted mortgage fraud investigations of prominent Democrats who are some of the president’s best known antagonists, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Rep. Eric Swalwell. In June, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal for the firms to accept cryptocurrency, another industry Trump has boosted, as part of the criteria for buying mortgages from banks. Last week, he persuaded Trump about the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building — a proposal that was widely criticized because it would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.

Pulte requested confidential Fannie Mae data and has publicly signaled that he is considering a crackdown if the companies do not increase construction volume. “I’m looking at the Fannie Mae builder data and with the top three homebuilders we buy EASILY over $20 billion in THEIR LOANS!” he posted to X in early October. In a brief statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, did not address questions from the AP, but said the agency “requires its regulated entities to carry out their operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” Fannie Mae said it takes “compliance with the law very seriously and we have a rigorous program to ensure we follow all laws and regulations.” Pulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment. Currying favor with the president Since his appointment to lead the FHFA, Pulte has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump. The 37-year-old scion of a homebuilding company fortune, Pulte has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-online millennial with a thirst for recognition and a desire to please the president. He and his wife also donated about $1 million to Trump’s campaign, campaign finance disclosures show. When Trump sought to oust Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Pulte became a leading attacker, routinely taking to X, formerly Twitter, where he has over 3 million followers, to excoriate the central bank leader. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that some Fannie Mae ethics and oversight officials who were fired last month had been investigating whether Pulte improperly obtained mortgage information for James, who was charged last month with bank fraud after Pulte sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department. She said the charges, which she denies, are politically motivated. Pulte’s power over the mortgage lending industry is unusual. Not long after his Senate confirmation, he appointed himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which hold trillions of dollars in assets. The companies serve as a crucial backstop for the home lending industry by buying up mortgages from individual lenders, which are packaged together and sold to investors. The three competing roles present the potential for a conflict of interest that is detailed in emails reviewed by AP. Like many matters of public policy in Trump’s Washington, it appears to have begun with a social media post. In October, Trump criticized the homebuilding industry, which he likened to the oil-market-dominating cartel OPEC. “They’re sitting on 2 million empty lots, A RECORD,” the president posted to his social media platform, Truth Social. “I’m asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to get Big Homebuilders going.” “On it,” Pulte posted in response on X. Sensitive data was gathered Pulte turned to Smith, who in her brief tenure at Fannie Mae had become a trusted Pulte ally whose work portfolio transcended the boundaries dividing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. Soon, a team at Fannie Mae was overseeing an effort to pull together a tranche of mortgage data, according to emails reviewed by the AP. Smith played a central role and shared the confidential lender-level pricing information with Freddie Mac, which set off alarms at both companies, according to the emails. A spokesman for Freddie Mac declined comment. In the Oct. 11 message to Smith, Evans, the Fannie Mae mortgage executive, also added others to the email chain because they “were involved with this week’s efforts to compile this information” and he wanted to “make sure you do not exacerbate this issue.” Danielle McCoy, Fannie Mae’s general counsel, weighed in, adding that the information Smith provided to Freddie Mac should “never be shared” and “could put the company at risk.” Others who were part of the email chain included Almodovar, the CEO; chief operating officer Peter Akwaboah; Devang Doshi, a senior vice president for capital markets; and John Roscoe, a Pulte loyalist and former Trump White House aide, who served as Fannie Mae’s executive vice president of public relations and operations. Days later, Almodovar, McCoy and Evans — who did not respond to requests for comment — were out of a job. Meanwhile, Roscoe was promoted to co-president of the company, while Akwaboah was named acting CEO. Pulte also got something he wanted. A day after the terse email exchange, Trump posted a graphic to his Truth Social network that featured Fannie Mae’s logo, a list of large homebuilders and the headline “We Give Them Billions.” Pulte quickly reposted it. ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed reporting."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-government-shutdown-c388d97a4e4acf5cca538fd901e46b2d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:33:05+00:00","title":"Wall Street Drops to One of Its Worst Days Since April on Worries About AI Stocks and Interest Rates","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. stock market plunged on Thursday, marking one of its worst days since April 2025, as investor fears over overvalued AI stocks—particularly Nvidia, Palantir, and Broadcom—combined with doubts about upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

superstar stocks kept dropping on worries their prices shot too high. Also hurting the market were questions about whether coming cuts to interest rates that Wall Street has been banking on will actually happen. The S&P 500 sank 1.7% and pulled further from its all-time high set late last month. It was the worst day in a month for the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts and the second-worst since April’s plunge after President Donald Trump shocked the world with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 797 points, or 1.7%, from its record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.3%. Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the market after the chip company fell 3.6%. Other stocks swept up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy also struggled, including drops of 7.4% for Super Micro Computer, 6.5% for Palantir Technologies and 4.3% for Broadcom.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Such sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation . AI stock prices have shot so high , though, that they’re drawing comparisons to the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. AP AUDIO: Wall Street drops to one of its worst days since April on worries about AI stocks and interest rates Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett was asked why he thought the market took such a huge hit today. In the meantime, stocks outside of AI also fell across Wall Street as traders worried that the Federal Reserve may not deliver another cut to interest rates in December, as many had been expecting. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they can goose the economy and prices for investments, even though they can also worsen inflation. A halt in cuts could undercut U.S. stock prices after they already ran to records in part on expectations for more reductions. Expectations have come down sharply in recent days that the Fed will cut its main interest rate for a third time this year. Traders now see roughly a coin flip’s chance of that, 51.9%, down from nearly 70% a week ago, according to data from CME Group. Recent comments from Fed officials have helped drive the doubt. Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said late Wednesday that it’s likely appropriate to leave interest rates steady “for some time.” That was a turnaround from a speech last month , when she supported another cut. The Fed’s job became more difficult recently because of the U.S. government’s shutdown , which delayed updates on the job market and other signals about the economy. That left it less certain about whether the slowing job market or high inflation is the bigger threat. The stock market mostly rose through the U.S. government’s shutdown, as it has often done historically , but Wall Street is bracing for potential swings as the government gets back to releasing those updates. The fear is that the data could persuade the Fed to halt its cuts to rates. The “looming data deluge may spur additional volatility in the coming weeks,” according to Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

The entertainment giant reported profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations, but its revenue fell short. That helped offset a jump of 4.6% for Cisco Systems after the tech giant delivered profit and revenue that were bigger than analysts estimated. Another one of the relatively few stocks to rise was Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by famed investor Warren Buffett . He is known for loving bargains and won’t buy stocks when he considers them too expensive. Berkshire Hathaway rose 2.1%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 113.43 points to 6,737.49.

2025-11-13T20:55:58+00:00\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Blue Origin launched its huge New Glenn rocket Thursday with a pair of NASA spacecraft destined for Mars . It was only the second flight of the rocket that Jeff Bezos’ company and NASA are counting on to get people and supplies to the moon — and it was a complete success. The 321-foot (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending NASA’s twin Mars orbiters on a drawn-out journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled four days by lousy local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida. In a remarkable first, Blue Origin recovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to SpaceX . Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600 kilometers) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from Launch Control. “Next stop, moon!” employees chanted following the booster’s bull’s-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket’s upper stage deployed the two Mars orbiters in space, the mission’s main objective. Congratulations poured in from NASA officials as well as SpaceX’s Elon Musk, whose booster landings are now routine. Related Stories Landmark Paris Agreement set a path to slow warming. The world hasn’t stayed on it 5 MIN READ Solar storms bring colorful northern lights to unexpected places 3 MIN READ How to spot November’s supermoon, the closest of the year 1 MIN READ New Glenn’s inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite to orbit, but failed to land the booster on its floating platform in the Atlantic. The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027. Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet’s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also learn how best to protect astronauts against Mars’ harsh radiation environment. “We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,” Escapade’s lead scientist, Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, said ahead of the launch. “Escapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we’re going to have two spacecraft at the same time.” It’s a relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80 million, that’s managed and operated by UC Berkeley. NASA saved money by signing up for one of New Glenn’s early flights. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but NASA passed up that ideal launch window — Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years — because of feared delays with Blue Origin’s brand-new rocket. Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the world , New Glenn is five times bigger than the New Shepard rockets sending wealthy clients to the edge of space from West Texas. Blue Origin plans to launch a prototype Blue Moon lunar lander on a demo mission in the coming months aboard New Glenn. Created in 2000 by Bezos, Amazon’s founder, Blue Origin already holds a NASA contract for the third moon landing by astronauts under the Artemis program. Musk’s SpaceX beat out Blue Origin for the first and second crew landings, using Starships, nearly 100 feet (30 meters) taller than Bezos’ New Glenn. But last month NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy reopened the contract for the first crewed moon landing, citing concern over the pace of Starship’s progress in flight tests from Texas. Blue Origin as well as SpaceX have presented accelerated landing plans. NASA is on track to send astronauts around the moon early next year using its own Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket. The next Artemis crew would attempt to land; the space agency is pressing to get astronauts back on the lunar surface by decade’s end in order to beat China. Twelve astronauts walked on the moon more than a half-century ago during NASA’s Apollo program. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

2025-11-13T23:43:43+00:00\n\nCARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — The yearslong case against six Nevada Republicans who were accused of submitting a bogus certificate that falsely declared President Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020 presidential election has been sent back to Clark County, where a jury is more likely to rule against them. The opinion released Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court reverses an earlier decision from a state judge who dismissed the case after ruling Clark County was the wrong venue for the case because the alleged crimes had occurred elsewhere in the state. Clark County is home to Las Vegas and leans Democratic. The higher court’s decision to let the case move forward marks a rare win for swing-state efforts to prosecute so-called fake electors who tried to keep Trump in the White House after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. In Michigan, a judge recently dismissed charges against 15 Republicans who had been charged by that state’s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel. The dismissal came after a judge in Arizona sent the fake electors case there back to the grand jury for fuller instructions about what federal law requires. “Today the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed what we have maintained all along — that Clark County is the proper and lawful venue to prosecute our case, and I am pleased with the court’s decision to overturn the District Court’s dismissal of our case in Clark County,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a statement.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on After the 2020 election, the six electors gathered outside of the Nevada Legislature to sign certificates giving the state’s six electoral votes to Trump, despite former President Joe Biden winning the state by more than 30,000 votes. The ceremony was broadcast online, and the video footage was used as evidence in the case. Criminal cases were also brought against Republican electors in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. On Monday, Trump pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others accused of aiding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The defendants have called the case political prosecution. They say they were exercising their First Amendment rights to criticize the state’s election processes. The six Nevadans, who had pleaded not guilty, include Michael McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, and Jesse Law, the former Clark County Republican Party chairman who was recently ousted in a July election. A main argument in the case focused on where the alleged crimes occurred. After that ceremony, one of the electors mailed the documents from Douglas County to the archivist of the United States and the president of the Senate in Washington, D.C. It was also sent to the Nevada secretary of state in Carson City and a federal judge in Las Vegas. Ford argued the case belongs in Clark County because the envelope was sent to Las Vegas, however one of the electors argued that the envelope was redirected to the judge’s chambers in Reno. The Nevada Supreme Court justices sided unanimously with the attorney general’s office, saying in its Thursday opinion that Nevada law does not preclude a venue from being appropriate in multiple counties for the same offense. As a precaution, Ford filed a separate case in Carson City in December 2024 to avoid the statute of limitations expiring while the Nevada Supreme Court made its decision. In the Carson City case, he charged the defendants with “uttering a forged instrument.” That case will likely be withdrawn. Ford, a Democrat, is running for governor in 2026."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/peptide-injections-rfk-maha-4d48e78a5d65658b4d6eac87818352e3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:03:15+00:00","title":"More Americans Injecting Unapproved Peptides in Quest for Anti-Aging and Muscle Growth","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing trend in the United States involves Americans injecting unapproved peptides into their bodies to enhance muscle growth, rejuvenate skin, and extend life.

Behind the trend is the surging popularity of GLP-1 weight loss medications , a class of so-called peptides approved to help users quickly shed pounds . But the peptides being promoted by influencers , celebrities and wellness gurus are different: Many have never been approved for human use and much of their purported evidence comes from studies in rats and other animals. Several peptides, such as BPC-157 and TB-500, are banned by international sports authorities as doping substances . “None of them are proven,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a research methods expert and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute. “None of them have gone through what would be considered adequate clinical trials, but nonetheless many people are taking these. It’s actually quite extraordinary.” Those who’ve highlighted peptides’ benefits include Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who has built a national following among Americans who are deeply skeptical of health experts, pharmaceutical companies and traditional medicine. For years, the Food and Drug Administration has been trying to crack down on the space, sending warning letters to clinics that promote the products and adding more than two dozen peptides to a list of ingredients that should not be made by specialty pharmacies that often custom mix the formulations.

Kennedy has vowed to end “FDA’s war” on peptides and other alternative treatments that are embraced by many in his Make America Healthy Again movement. Some of Kennedy’s friends and associates are among the biggest proponents, including self-described “biohacker” and “longevity expert” Gary Brecka, who sells peptide injectables, patches and nasal sprays through his website for $350 to $600 each. In a May appearance on Brecka’s podcast, Kennedy again promised to “end the war at FDA” on peptides, stem cells , psychedelics and other fringe therapies. “Music to my ears,” Brecka replied. Brecka declined to be interviewed for this story. Peptides are now part of the ‘circus’ of unproven wellness products Peptides are essentially the building blocks of more complex proteins. Inside the human body, peptides trigger hormones needed for growth, metabolism and healing. The FDA has approved a number of peptides as medications, including insulin for diabetics who don’t naturally produce it and human growth hormone for children with developmental disorders caused by low levels of the hormone. A closer look at the unapproved peptide injections promoted by influencers and celebrities But many other peptides promoted online have never been approved, making them technically illegal to market as drugs. Under current FDA guidance these peptides also are ineligible for compounding — the process in which pharmacies mix made-to-order medications for patients. That hasn’t stopped celebrities and influencers from touting them. Joe Rogan , for example, has repeatedly praised BPC-157, a peptide derived from acids found in the gut. “I had tendonitis in my elbow, I started using BPC-157 and it was gone in two weeks,” Rogan told his podcast audience last year. He is among the celebrity clients listed on the website of Ways 2 Well, a Texas-based company that offers peptides, stem cells , vitamin infusions and other alternative treatments. It’s all part of “the circus of unproven, expensive and possibly dangerous” offerings promoted by wellness and longevity clinics , said Topol, who has written about the industry. For $99, Ways 2 Well offers a “peptide consult” with a physician, after which the company ships the peptide vials along with a “full kit with dosing, instructions and syringes,” according to its website. Company founder Brigham Buhler is a former pharmaceutical sales rep. He did not respond to requests for comment. Peptides are often pitched as a ‘natural’ alternative to modern medicine Andrea Steinbrenner, a consulting executive, said she became intrigued by peptides after hearing about their benefits for “longevity, repair, anti-aging and energy,” from an acquaintance who runs a clinic outside of San Diego. Steinbrenner and her husband now receive monthly infusions at the clinic, in addition to daily supplements. “I think peptides are popular right now because we are the aging generation and we are looking for alternatives to modern day medicine,” she said. “I absolutely believe in modern day, western medicine— it’s necessary. But there’s a lot of other things in the universe that the earth supplies.” Andrea Steinbrenner receives an IV infusion at Pure Alchemy Wellness, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025, in Chula Vista, Calif.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Peptide proponents often suggest their products are safe because they are based on substances found in the body. “Unlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, peptides are naturally recognized by your body,” Brecka told his more than 2 million Instagram followers in February. Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms. Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 — both of which the FDA has flagged for serious safety risks. Like other peptides sold on Brecka’s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: “research use only.” Research claims are often a ploy to dodge regulators The “research use” language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and “stacking” different drug combinations. One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: “instead of ‘taking’ you are ’researching’ peptides.” Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren’t intended for human use.

Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses. That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits. One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: “Our basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.” A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA’s list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks. In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded. Some in the industry disagree. “Physicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA’s inaction, they don’t,” said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies. Changes may be coming The FDA, under Kennedy’s authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won’t enforce bans against them.

quickly to get full SNAP food benefits to millions of people who made do with little-to-no assistance for the past couple of weeks. A back-and-forth series of court rulings and shifting policies from President Donald Trump’s administration has led to a patchwork distribution of November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program . While some states already had issued full SNAP benefits, about two-thirds of states had issued only partial benefits or none at all before the government shutdown ended late Wednesday, according to an Associated Press tally. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the program, issued new guidance Thursday, instructing: “State agencies must take immediate steps to ensure households receive their full November allotments promptly.” The federal food program serves about 42 million people, about 1 in 8 Americans, in lower-income households. They receive an average of around $190 monthly per person, though that doesn’t necessarily cover the full cost of groceries for a regular month.

Under normal circumstances, recipients can only go three months in a span of three years without meeting the work requirements. States shifting from zero to full speed for benefits In some states where SNAP recipients had received nothing during November, officials said they are working to load money on to people’s electronic benefit cards by Friday, if not sooner. The Arkansas Department of Human Services said Thursday that full November SNAP benefits are expected to be available at midnight for people to buy groceries. “This has been difficult for our beneficiaries, and we are incredibly appreciative to our partners across the state who helped bridge the gap through food pantries, donation drives, and other assistance efforts,” department Secretary Janet Mann said in a statement. Officials in South Carolina and West Virginia, which also had not issued November benefits, said the full monthly amount should be available by Friday. And Alabama said full SNAP benefits should be issued Thursday. North Carolina, which issued partial benefits last week, said full monthly SNAP benefits should be loaded on people’s electronic cards by Friday. Colorado said it was switching from delivering partial to full SNAP benefits Thursday. The Illinois Department of Human Services, which previously issued partial November benefits, said Thursday that it is “working to restore full SNAP benefits.” But it won’t happen instantly. “We anticipate that the remaining benefit payments will be made over several days, starting tomorrow,” the department said in a statement, and that “all SNAP recipients will receive their full November benefits by November 20th.” Paused SNAP payments stirred stress for some families The delayed SNAP payments posed another complication for Lee Harris’ family since his spouse was laid off a few months ago. Harris, 34, said the North Little Rock, Arkansas, family got help from his temple and received food left by someone who was moving. With that assistance — and the knowledge that other families have greater needs — they skipped stopping by the food pantry they had sometimes used. They and their three daughters have been able to keep meals fairly close to normal despite missing a SNAP payment this week. But they still have experienced stress and uncertainty. “Not knowing a definite end,” Harris said, “I don’t know how much I need to stretch what I have in our pantry.” Federal legislation funds SNAP for a year The USDA told states Oct. 24 that it would not fund SNAP benefits for November amid the government shutdown. Many Democratic-led states sued to have the funding restored. After judges ruled the Trump administration must tap into reserves to fund SNAP, the administration said it would fund up to 65% of its regular allocations. When a judge subsequently ordered full benefits, some states scrambled to quickly load SNAP benefits onto participants’ cards during a one-day window before the Supreme Court put that order on hold Friday. Meanwhile, other states went forward with partial benefits, and still others issued nothing while waiting for further USDA guidance about the situation. Amid the uncertainty over federal SNAP funding, some states tapped into their own funds to provide direct aid to SNAP recipients or additional money for nonprofit food banks . The legislation to reopen the U.S. government provides full SNAP benefits not only for November but also for the remainder of the federal fiscal year, which runs through next September. Citing that legislation, the Justice Department on Thursday dropped its request for the Supreme Court to continue blocking a judicial order to pay full SNAP benefits. ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; John O’Connor in Springfield, Illinois; John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia; and Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1411-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global developments: health crises in Ethiopia’s Omo region bordering conflict-affected South Sudan, ongoing military tensions in Israel and Gaza despite a ceasefire, political instability in Tanzania following Samia Suluhu Hassan’s re-election and a deadly police crackdown, strong first-round support for political candidate Jara who may face a run-off, and escalating violence by Sudan’s paramilitary RSF, which captured el-Fasher and is now targeting el-Obeid.

California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026. The complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump . It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who’s seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender. “California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.” Newsom spokesperson Brandon Richards said in a statement, “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.” The legal move against heavily Democratic California marks the first time the Justice Department has sued over a flurry of unusual, mid-decade House map revisions across the country that were drawn to maximize partisan advantage in advance of next year’s elections.

Here’s what to know about the case. 4 MIN READ The Latest: Federal offices reopen as the government shutdown ends 17 MIN READ Three Republican-led states — Texas, along with Missouri and North Carolina — have not faced federal legal action after revamping district lines following Trump’s call for new maps to expand GOP numbers in the House. Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box. California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year’s midterm elections. The Justice Department is joining a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections. “Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 — the recent ballot initiative that junked California’s pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California’s congressional district lines,” the lawsuit says. Prop 50 was Newsom’s response to Trump’s maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line. Democrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber , which would imperil Trump’s agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans hold 219 seats, to Democrats’ 214. The showdown between the nation’s two most populous states has spread nationally, with Missouri , North Carolina and Ohio adopting new district lines that could provide a partisan advantage. Other states are considering similar moves. The national implications of California’s ballot measure were clear in both the money it attracted and the high-profile figures who became involved. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into the race, including a $5 million donation to opponents from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super political action committee tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it , while former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared in ads supporting it , calling it a “smart” approach to counter Republican moves aimed at safeguarding House control. The contest provided Newsom with a national platform and he has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028. ___ Richer reported from Chicago."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/indigenous-activists-storm-cop30-climate-summit-in-brazil-demanding-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:16:29+00:00","title":"Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including members of the Tupinamba community and the Yaku Mama flotilla, protested at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding that their lands be protected from oil drilling, agribusiness, and illegal logging.

protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/ethiopia-confirms-first-outbreak-of-marburg-virus","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:50:23+00:00","title":"Ethiopia confirms first outbreak of Marburg virus","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ethiopia has confirmed its first outbreak of Marburg virus disease in the Omo region, a southern area bordering South Sudan.

mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/is-keir-starmer-facing-a-plot-to-depose-him-as-uk-prime-minister","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:17:19Z","title":"Is Keir Starmer facing a plot to depose him as UK prime minister?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a growing political crisis within the UK Labour Party, centered on allegations that an unsanctioned briefing was circulated by unnamed allies of Prime Minister Keir Starmer to deter ministers from challenging his leadership.

distance himself from an unofficial briefing to the media by unnamed “allies” that he intends to fight off a leadership contest which, they say, could come just 18 months into his premiership.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, unnamed sources were cited in The Guardian newspaper saying Health Secretary Wes Streeting has gathered significant backing to supplant Starmer.\n\nBut on Wednesday morning, Streeting denied this, telling journalists that he was “not challenging the prime minister”.\n\n“I’m not doing any of the things some silly briefer said overnight,” he stated.\n\nAsked if those responsible for the briefing should be sacked, Streeting said, “Yes. But he’s [Starmer] got to find them first, and I wouldn’t expect him to waste loads of time on this.”\n\n“There are people around the prime minister who do not follow his model and style of leadership,” he said.\n\nIn response to the ensuing media storm, Starmer, whose premiership since last year has been marred by poor polling, told reporters in north Wales on Thursday that briefings against ministers are “completely unacceptable”.\n\n“I have been talking to my team today. I have been assured that no briefing against ministers was done from Number 10, but I have made it clear that I find it absolutely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe current internal party strife has shone a light on the prime minister’s standing as leader of the Labour Party.\n\nIn its most recent poll on Tuesday, pollster YouGov said of 4,989 people polled, only 27 percent thought he should continue as Labour Party leader.\n\nHere’s what we know about the rumours of a leadership plot:\n\nOn Tuesday evening, unnamed senior Starmer aides told The Guardian newspaper that any attempt to remove the prime minister would be “reckless” and “dangerous”. According to the aides, deposing Starmer so early in his term as prime minister would undermine financial markets and reverberate on the stock market, the party and its international relationships.\n\n“The party would not recover for a generation,” one of the unnamed sources told The Guardian.\n\nNumber 10 sources also told The Guardian they are concerned about rumours that Streeting could be planning a “coup” and is just one of several Labour ministers who are “on manoeuvres” to take the leadership if the opportunity arises. However, none of them were likely to move against the prime minister right now.\n\nThey said the most likely moment for a leadership challenge would be after the autumn budget – the government’s tax-and-spending review, due in parliament on November 26 – if higher taxes are announced, or after May elections next year if the Labour party performs poorly.\n\n“Keir will not stand aside at this point, for Wes or anybody else,” one source told The Guardian.\n\nOn Friday, the UK’s Financial Times cited an unnamed minister who claimed that support for the health secretary was growing following the news of the unsanctioned “briefing”.\n\nStreeting was not the only name mentioned as a potential leadership contender. Both Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Energy Secretary and a former leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband were named as possible contenders, the sources said.\n\nPolitics professor Nicholas Allen, from Royal Holloway University in London, explained that the briefing revealed “genuine concern, at least in some quarters, that Starmer is vulnerable”.\n\nAllen said it would be difficult to achieve a new leadership election because Labour Party rules state that a contender have the support of 20 percent of MPs to be nominated. This would be hard to do with party whips, which enforce a party consensus.\n\n“I don’t know how strong Streeting’s support is,” Allen said. “He probably couldn’t force Starmer out by himself; what would be more likely is a collapse in support within the party, fuelled by low poll ratings and unforced errors (like the briefing), and Starmer deciding to step down or being encouraged to go by a group of senior ministers. At that point, the field would be open. Streeting may or may not be the perceived saviour,” he said.\n\nThe British press is speculating that the unofficial briefing may have been organised by Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a tactic designed to put off any ministers thinking about challenging him.\n\nMcSweeney, who has been widely credited with helping Starmer to win the July 2024 election, is now facing calls to resign from unnamed members of parliament, according to reports.\n\nHowever, Starmer appeared not to support such a move on Thursday when he reiterated that he “of course” has complete confidence in his chief of staff.\n\nConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch was quick to respond, accusing Starmer of losing control of his party during Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Question Time.\n\nBadenoch called Starmer a “weak prime minister at war with his own cabinet”.\n\n“Two weeks before the budget, isn’t it the case that this prime minister has lost control of government, he’s lost control of his party and lost the trust of the British people,” she said.\n\nEarlier in the debate, Badenoch referred to an interview Streeting gave to the BBC in which he accused Downing Street of having a “toxic culture”, and asked Starmer if his minister was correct.\n\n“Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable,” Starmer said in response.\n\nMeanwhile, the far-right Reform UK party’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, wrote on X on Thursday that the “terrifying thing about the coup against Starmer is that Labour members will choose his replacement”.\n\n“Their favourite Labour minister is Ed Miliband. Some of the most unhinged people in the country will choose the next Prime Minister,” he added.\n\nReform’s popularity has risen hugely in the UK since last year’s election.\n\nThe briefing came just two weeks before Starmer and his chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, announced the autumn budget on November 26.\n\nThe budget, which outlines the government’s tax-and-spending plans for the next year, has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, as it was widely expected to break one of Labour’s main election pledges: not to increase income taxes.\n\nHowever, the Financial Times reported on Friday morning that Reeves is now ruling out any rise in income tax amid concerns that it could seriously anger voters and backbench legislators.\n\nSince winning the election in 2024, the prime minister has received backlash from across the political spectrum, including from Labour voters, over several issues.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll in September, if an election were to be called now, the far-right Reform UK would win, leaving the Labour Party as the second-largest party and the former governing party, the Conservatives, in third place.\n\nAllen said the briefing could damage public perception of the Labour party further as it has revealed “a desire by some to engage in tribal fights with senior ministers” and that Starmer “doesn’t do politics very well, either in terms of surrounding himself with reliable people (if he didn’t know) or in terms of political judgement (if he did authorise it)”.\n\n“It merely confirms what most voters probably already think: that the current Labour government and its prime minister aren’t all that good, or at least not significantly better than the Conservative government they voted out less than 18 months ago,” Allen said.\n\nHere are some of the main areas of domestic policy which are causing the popularity of Starmer’s Labour Party to  wane .\n\nThe opposition Reform UK party has risen in popularity largely on the back of its calls for stricter migrant control. The key issue is the rapid rise in the numbers of people arriving in small boats across the English Channel from France, particularly in the past year.\n\nIn September, Starmer struck a  “one-in-one-out” migrant exchange deal  with France in an effort to deter people from attempting the Channel crossing. Under the deal, France will accept the return of asylum seekers who crossed to the UK but cannot prove a family connection to the UK.\n\nFor each migrant France takes back, the UK will grant asylum to one person who has arrived from France through official channels and who can prove they have family connections in the UK.\n\nBut only a handful of migrants have been deported under the scheme so far. Furthermore, on Monday, the Home Office reported that a second migrant had re-entered the UK after being deported to France.\n\nStarmer has faced criticism for his lukewarm response to the rising number of far-right protests across the country.\n\nIn September, at least 11,000 people joined a “Unite the Kingdom” march, displaying the St George flag in London.\n\nWhile Starmer denounced violence against police officers during the protests and argued that the UK was “built on diversity”, the antifascist group,  Hope Not Hate , and several MPs have urged the government to take stronger action against the rise of far-right groups.\n\nCritics also say Starmer has not done enough to appeal to people who support Reform, or to address their concerns about migration.\n\nIn a major blunder, HMP Wandsworth prison in London wrongly released two offenders in early November, including an Algerian sex offender.\n\nBoth men were eventually returned to prison but, in the case of the Algerian offender, only after the man handed himself in. Conservative Party shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said the mistake revealed “the incompetence of this government”.\n\nStarmer has been grappling with a low-growth economy since the start of his term in government.\n\nAccording to new figures from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday, between July and September, the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by just 0.1 percent in comparison with growth of 0.3 percent between April and July.\n\nMeanwhile, inflation remained stuck at 3.8 percent in September 2025 – unchanged from July and August. This is the highest it has been since the start of 2024."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/several-people-killed-and-injured-as-bus-crashes-into-stop-in-sweden","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"18:01:45+00:00","title":"Several people killed and injured as bus crashes into stop in Sweden","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus crash in central Stockholm, Sweden, on Friday, 14 November 2025, resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries when the vehicle struck a bus stop queue near the Royal Institute of Technology.

dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/indonesia-readies-gaza-stabilisation-force-hosts-jordans-king-for-talks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:13:23+00:00","title":"Indonesia readies Gaza stabilisation force, hosts Jordan’s king for talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indonesia is preparing up to 20,000 soldiers for a proposed international stabilisation force (ISF) in Gaza under the framework of Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan.

He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/tanzanias-president-announces-probe-into-post-election-protest-deaths","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:16:36Z","title":"Tanzania’s president announces probe into post-election protest deaths","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a controversial presidential election in October 2025, in which President Samia Suluhu Hassan won with nearly 98% of the vote after opposition candidates were barred, widespread protests erupted in Tanzania, resulting in hundreds of deaths and mass arrests.

assistance to Israel to help fund the war on Gaza – totalling  more than $21bn .\n\nIsrael’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, including at least 20,000 children, and turned most of the territory into rubble.\n\nThroughout the war, Israel imposed a blockade on aid to Gaza, sparking a  deadly famine  in the enclave.\n\nEven after a US-brokered ceasefire came into effect last month, Israel has  continued to restrict  the entry of food and fuel to Gaza. The Israeli military has also been carrying out air strikes and shootings in Gaza daily in violation of the truce.\n\nTlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, said the genocide in Gaza is ongoing.\n\n“Since the so-called ‘ceasefire’ was announced, Israeli forces haven’t stopped killing Palestinians,” the congresswoman said in a statement on Friday..\n\n“Impunity only enables more atrocity. As our government continues to send a blank check for war crimes and ethnic cleansing, Palestinian children’s smiles are extinguished by bombs and bullets that say ‘made in the USA’.”\n\nUnited Nations investigators and leading rights groups – including Amnesty International and  Israel’s B’Tselem  – have concluded that the Israeli offensive is a genocide.\n\nA UN convention defines  genocide as  “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.\n\nGenocidal acts include killing and injuring members of the targeted group, preventing births and imposing “conditions of life calculated to bring about” the physical destruction of the group.\n\nTlaib’s resolution quotes public statements by Israeli political and military officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog – calling for mass violence and collective punishment against Palestinians.\n\n“This place will be a fallow land. They will not be able to live here,” Colonel Erez Eshel said in November 2023.\n\nDespite the growing consensus among rights experts that the war in Gaza is a genocide, only a fraction of Congress members have adopted the label when describing the Israeli offensive.\n\nIn addition to the 21 House Democrats backing the resolution, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and progressive Senator  Bernie Sanders  have also accused Israel of genocide.\n\nExperts say the description is important because the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide invokes a global responsibility to stop the atrocities and hold the perpetrators responsible.\n\nMore than 100 rights groups have endorsed Tlaib’s congressional proposal.\n\n“This resolution is an important step towards recognising Israel’s actions against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip for what they are – genocide,” Elizabeth Rghebi, Middle East advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.\n\n“The US ratified the Genocide Convention, which imposes a duty on states to prevent and punish the crime. Amnesty International calls on all members of Congress to urgently support this resolution and ensure the US begins taking the actions necessary to prevent and punish Israel’s  genocide in Gaza .”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/normalising-hate-israel-leans-in-to-anti-palestinian-violence-rhetoric","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:26:17Z","title":"Normalising hate: Israel leans in to anti-Palestinian violence, rhetoric","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a US-imposed ceasefire in October 2025, Israel continues to carry out attacks on Gaza and experiences a sharp increase in anti-Palestinian violence across the West Bank.

rhetoric\n\nThe US-imposed ceasefire of October 10 has  not stopped Israel’s regular attacks  on the Gaza Strip. Nor has it threatened to hold a parliament and society that largely cheered on the war, which has been deemed genocidal by multiple international bodies, accountable for their actions.\n\nInstead, fuelled by what analysts from within Israel have described as an absolute sense of impunity, anti-Palestinian violence has intensified across the country and the occupied West Bank while much of the world continues to look away, convinced that the work of the ceasefire is done.\n\nIn the parliament, or Knesset, a senior lawmaker and member of the governing party openly defended convicted ultranationalist Meir Kahane, long considered beyond the pale even by members of Israel’s right wing and whose Kach movement has been banned as a “terrorist organisation”. At the same time, the parliament is  debating  reintroducing the death penalty, as well as expanding the terms of the offences for which it might apply – both unambiguously targeting Palestinians.\n\nUnder the legislation, proposed by ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir – who himself has past “terrorism”-related convictions for his outspoken support of Kahane –  anyone found guilty of killing Israelis because of “racist” motives and “with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the revival of the Jewish people in its land” would face execution.\n\nThat bill passed its first reading this week.\n\n“The absence of any attempt to assert accountability from the outside, from Israel’s allies, echoes into Israel’s own Knesset,” analyst and former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy said. “There’s no sense that Israel has done anything wrong or that anyone should be held to account.”\n\nEven Israel’s media, traditionally cheerleaders of the country’s war on Gaza, has not proven exempt from the hardening of attitudes. Legislation is already under way to close Army Radio because it had been broadcasting what Defence Minister Israel Katz described as political content that could undermine the army, as well as extend what lawmakers have referred to as the so-called “Al Jazeera law”, allowing them to shutter any foreign media perceived as a threat to Israel’s national security.\n\n“Israel has built up this energy through two years of genocide,” Orly Noy, editor of the Hebrew-language Local Call, told Al Jazeera. “That hasn’t gone anywhere.\n\n“Just because there’s a ceasefire and the hostages are back, the racism, the supremacy and the unmasked violence didn’t just disappear. We’re seeing daily pogroms by soldiers and settlers in the West Bank. There are daily attacks on Palestinian bus drivers. It’s become dangerous to speak Arabic, not just within the ‘48, but anywhere,” she said, referring to Israel’s initial borders of 1948.\n\nIn the West Bank, Israeli violence against Palestinians has reached unprecedented proportions. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there were 264 attacks against Palestinians in the month the ceasefire was announced: the equivalent of eight attacks per day, the highest number since the agency first started tracking attacks in 2006.\n\nIsrael’s interior appears no less secure from the mob. On Tuesday, a meeting at a private house in Pardes Hanna near Haifa, hosted by Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian member of the Knesset, was surrounded and attacked by a mob of right-wing protesters. As police reportedly stood nearby, Israeli protesters surrounded the house, chanting “Terrorist! Terrorist!” and singing “May your village burn” in an attempt to interrupt the meeting, which was billed as a chance to build “partnership and peace” after “two years characterised mainly by pain and hostility”.\n\nAnd in the Israeli Supreme Court on Monday, two of the soldiers accused of the brutal gang  rape  of a Palestinian prisoner at Sde Teiman prison last year were met, not by condemnation, but  applause  and chants of “We are all Unit 100”, referring to the military unit accused of raping the Palestinian man.\n\n“They’re not cheering rapists, they’re cheering this idea that nothing matters any more,” Ori Goldberg, a political scientist based near Tel Aviv, said. “Genocide devalues everything. Once you’ve carried out a genocide, nothing matters any more. Not the lives of those you’ve killed and, by extension, not your own. Nothing carries any consequence. Not your actions, nothing. We’ve become hollow.”\n\nSeeming to prove Goldberg’s point in the Knesset on Wednesday was Nissim Vaturi, the body’s deputy speaker and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing Likud party. Vaturi crossed one of Israel’s few political rubicons and directly referenced Kahane, whose name has become a rallying cry for settlers and ultranationalist groups across Israel.\n\nAsked if he was in favour of “Jewish terror”, Vaturi replied “I support it. Believe me, Kahane was right in many ways where we were wrong, where the people of Israel were wrong,” he said, referencing the former lawmaker convicted of “terrorism” offences in both Israel and the US and whose party, Kach, remains a proscribed “terrorist group” across much of the world.\n\n“Once you’ve manufactured consent for genocide, you need to be proactive in dialling the cruelty levels down, which is something we’re not seeing,” Levy said. “If anything, we’re just seeing it continue. They have dialled the cruelty levels up to 11 …  and they’re leaving them there.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/un-rights-council-orders-probe-of-appalling-abuses-in-sudans-el-fasher","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:03:57+00:00","title":"UN rights council orders probe of ‘appalling’ abuses in Sudan’s el-Fasher","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Human Rights Council has ordered an urgent investigation into widespread atrocities in el-Fasher, Sudan, following the RSF’s takeover of the city in October 2025.

since the city fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) last month.\n\nDuring a special session in Geneva on Friday, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution ordering the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Sudan to urgently investigate violations in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.\n\nThe resolution also called on the investigative team to “identify, where possible” suspected perpetrators in an effort to ensure they are “held accountable”.\n\nThe move comes weeks after the RSF, which has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for control of Sudan since April 2023, took full control of el-Fasher on October 26 after an 18-month siege on the city.\n\nNearly 100,000 people have  fled el-Fasher  since the RSF’s takeover, with displaced Sudanese civilians saying they faced indiscriminate attacks and sexual violence, among other abuses.  Many said  they saw dead bodies lining the streets.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told the council on Friday that the “atrocities that are unfolding in el-Fasher were foreseen and preventable” and “constitute the gravest of crimes”.\n\nHe said the UN had warned that the fall of el-Fasher “would result in a bloodbath”.\n\n“So none of us should be surprised by reports that since the RSF took control of el-Fasher, there have been mass killings of civilians, ethnically targeted executions, sexual violence including gang rape, abductions for ransom, widespread arbitrary detentions, attacks on health facilities, medical staff and humanitarian workers, and other appalling atrocities,” Turk said.\n\n“The international community has a clear duty to act. There has been too much pretence and performance and too little action. It must stand up against these atrocities, a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.”\n\nThe RSF has denied targeting civilians or blocking aid, saying such activities are due to rogue actors.\n\nBut the UN, human rights groups and other observers have said evidence suggests that  mass killings  were committed by the paramilitary group.\n\nSudanese medics  have also warned that the RSF appears to be trying to bury the bodies of those killed in el-Fasher in an effort to conceal what happened.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of people are believed to remain trapped in the city, prompting the head of the UN’s migration agency this week  to urgently call  for a ceasefire and a humanitarian corridor to provide aid to those civilians.\n\nDuring Friday’s Human Rights Council session, Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN’s independent fact-finding mission on Sudan, described examples of rape, killing and torture and said a comprehensive investigation is required to establish the full picture.\n\nShe said RSF forces had turned el-Fasher University, where thousands of civilians had been sheltering, “into a killing ground”.\n\nMeanwhile, Turk warned that violence is “surging” to the neighbouring Kordofan region, where bombardments, blockades and forced displacement have been reported. “Kordofan must not suffer the same fate as Darfur,” he said.\n\nThe council, which is made up of 47 UN member countries, does not have the power to force countries or others to comply, but can shine a spotlight on rights violations and help document them for possible use in places like the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nIn early November,  the ICC said  it was “taking immediate steps regarding the alleged crimes in el-Fasher to preserve and collect relevant evidence for its use in future prosecutions” as part of an ongoing investigation into abuses committed in Darfur since April 2023."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/xi-jinping-pledges-deeper-ties-during-thai-kings-first-china-visit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:38:55+00:00","title":"Xi Jinping pledges deeper ties during Thai king’s first China visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the first state visit by a reigning Thai monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, to China, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged deeper strategic ties, describing the relationship as 'family' and committing to expanded cooperation in key sectors such as the China-Thailand railway link, artificial intelligence, aerospace, and the digital economy.

strategic alignment” with the Southeast Asian nation.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, who has rarely made overseas state visits since he ascended the throne nine years ago, is in Beijing with his wife, Queen Suthida, for his first official visit to China.\n\nXi said cooperation would be expanded on a China-Thailand railway link as well as in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, aerospace and the digital economy.\n\n“King Vajiralongkorn’s choice of China as his first major country for a state visit … fully demonstrates the high importance he attaches to China-Thailand relations,” Xi said, according to CCTV.\n\nVajiralongkorn described his country’s relationship with China as “brotherly cooperation” and expressed his desire to deepen exchanges in various areas.\n\nThe Thai royals were scheduled to visit a Buddhist temple and an aerospace development hub in Beijing, as well as attend a state banquet.\n\nThailand was a key ally of the United States during the Cold War, but China is the kingdom’s biggest trading partner and increasingly a source of military equipment.\n\nThe two countries have recently stepped up a joint crackdown on telecommunications fraud and illegal gambling gangs that operate in border areas, mostly in Myanmar, and often target Chinese nationals.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thailand extradited Chinese national She Zhijiang, who is allegedly linked to a lucrative scam hub in Myanmar. He had been in Thai custody since 2022.\n\nChina also pushed for a ceasefire between  Thailand and Cambodia , a close partner of Beijing, after border clashes in the summer caused dozens of deaths.\n\nThat truce has proved fragile, with Thailand on Monday pausing its implementation after claiming a blast from a newly laid landmine had wounded four of its soldiers.\n\nThe two sides have subsequently traded accusations of further clashes along their border."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/un-peacekeepers-say-israel-built-walls-inside-lebanese-territory","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:25:46Z","title":"UN peacekeepers say Israel built walls inside Lebanese territory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has reported that Israeli military forces have constructed concrete walls in Lebanese territory, specifically southwest and southeast of the town of Yaroun in the Nabatieh district, crossing the UN-backed Blue Line.

constructed walls in Lebanese territory that cross a UN-backed, unofficial “border” between the two countries.\n\nThe statement on Friday comes as Israel has carried out  near-daily attacks across Lebanon  – including in the south of the country, in particular – despite a ceasefire signed a year ago with Lebanese group Hezbollah.\n\nIn UNIFIL’s statement, the force said Israel had built “a concrete T-wall” southwest of Yaroun, a town in Lebanon’s southern Nabatieh district.\n\nThe wall extends across the  so-called Blue Line  and has made “more than 4,000 square metres [43,055sq feet] of Lebanese territory inaccessible to the Lebanese people”, it added.\n\nEstablished in 2000, the Blue Line is a 120km (75-mile) unofficial “border” drawn up by the UN between Lebanon and Israel.\n\nThe demarcation line’s main purpose is to confirm the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Lebanese territory as mandated by UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nIn October, UNIFIL peacekeepers conducted a geospatial survey of a concrete T-wall erected by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) southwest of Yaroun.\n\n— UNIFIL (@UNIFIL_)  November 14, 2025\n\nUNIFIL said another section of the wall, southeast of Yaroun, also extends beyond the Blue Line. “UNIFIL informed the [Israeli army] of our findings and requested that they move the walls,” it said.\n\nIn response to UNIFIL’s statement on Friday, the Israeli military told the AFP news agency that the wall “is part of a broader plan whose construction began in 2022”.\n\n“Since the start of the war, and as part of lessons learnt from it, the [Israeli military] has been advancing a series of measures, including reinforcing the physical barrier along the northern border,” it said.\n\n“It should be emphasised that the wall does not cross the Blue Line,” the military added.\n\nThe Israeli army has killed more than 4,000 people and injured nearly 17,000 in its attacks on Lebanon, which began in October 2023 amid the Gaza war and turned into a full-scale offensive in September 2024. The deadly attacks have not ceased despite last November’s ceasefire agreement.\n\nAs  tensions increase , Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam on Thursday called for an end to Israel’s military escalation in southern Lebanon, warning that it poses a threat to regional stability.\n\nUNIFIL said “Israeli presence and construction in Lebanese territory are violations of Security Council resolution 1701 and of Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\n\n“We again call on the [Israeli military] to respect the Blue Line in its full length and withdraw from all areas north of it,” it added.\n\nResolution 1701, adopted in 2006, calls for a cessation of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel and the establishment of a weapons-free zone between the Blue Line and Lebanon’s Litani River.\n\nUnder last year’s  ceasefire , the Israeli army was supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon in January.\n\nBut it only partially withdrew, continuing to maintain a military presence at five border outposts."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report warning that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure — affecting over 3.5 billion people — is endangering billions of lives, causing severe health risks and human rights violations, especially against Indigenous communities and environmental activists.

‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-12-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-12:00","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera: Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm watch issued by the US weather agency, Amazon's recent layoffs, and claims by former President Trump linking Tylenol to autism.

tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of powerful solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, including two that impacted Earth on November 9 and 10 and a third on November 11, have triggered a G4-level geomagnetic storm.

know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/trump-asks-justice-department-to-investigate-bill-clinton-over-epstein-ties","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:41:36Z","title":"Trump asks Justice Department to investigate Bill Clinton over Epstein ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly requested the Justice Department to investigate former President Bill Clinton and others, including Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, and JPMorgan Chase, over alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

2025-11-14T19:41:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump asks Justice Department to investigate Bill Clinton over Epstein ties\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has called on the Department of Justice to investigate ties between one of his Democratic predecessors, Bill Clinton, and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut the request comes shortly after a trove of newly released emails raised questions about Trump’s own relationship with Epstein.\n\nOn Friday, Trump took to social media to once again frame the emails as a distraction. He compared them to an investigation into ties between Russian election interference and his presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n“This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump  wrote , framing the emails as a “hoax”.\n\nHe also sought to shift scrutiny of his actions onto Democrats and financial institutions, arguing that they had deeper relationships with Epstein than he did.\n\n“Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat’s problem, not the Republican’s problem!” Trump wrote, before adding: “Don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”\n\nIn the  second  of two lengthy posts, Trump said he would ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate former President Clinton, as well as Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, venture capitalist Reid Hoffman and the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n\nThe Epstein scandal has proven to be an enduring headache for Trump during his second administration, as he faces bipartisan pressure to release the full slate of documents pertaining to the case and address his own involvement.\n\nA wealthy financier, Epstein was known to socialise with powerful figures, including Trump, Clinton and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, a former prince in the United Kingdom whose involvement resulted  in the loss of his royal titles  last month.\n\nThose associations have long drawn questions about how Epstein may have been shielded from accountability.\n\nHundreds of women  have come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse and trafficking. In 2008, Epstein was convicted in Florida of sexually abusing a minor and solicitation, but critics saw his plea deal as overly lenient.\n\nAt the time of his death by suicide in 2019, he was in jail, facing federal sex-trafficking charges. The circumstances of his death have fuelled conspiracy theories, as has the high-profile nature of his social circle, leading some to believe there was a cover-up.\n\nTrump’s own relationship with Epstein came roaring back into the spotlight on Wednesday, as the  longest government shutdown  in US history came to a close.\n\nThe House of Representatives had come back into session for the first time in 54 days in order to vote on a funding bill that would end the 42-day-long shutdown.\n\nBut that morning, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  released  three excerpted emails from conversations between Epstein, his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and the writer Michael Wolff, all of which discussed Trump. They appeared to suggest Trump knew about Epstein’s sexual relationships.\n\nIn one email, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him.”\n\nIn another, Epstein told Wolff, “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n\nA third email from Wolff suggested Trump had been to Epstein’s house and on his plane, and discussed how Trump might address those visits in a CNN interview.\n\nThe Trump administration quickly leapt into damage control, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing the email release as selectively edited and a Democratic “smear” campaign.\n\nLater that day, however, the Republican leadership on the House Oversight Committee  published  20,000 emails from the Epstein case file, including more conversations about Trump.\n\nIn a 2017 email to Summers, for example, Epstein wrote, “i have met some very bad people ,, none as bad as trump. not one decent cell in his body.. so yes – dangerous.”\n\nIn Friday’s messages, Trump argued that the emails were an attempt to distract from the prolonged government shutdown, during which time Democrats failed to negotiate protections for healthcare subsidies scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\n\n“The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT,” Trump said.\n\nHe also denounced Republicans for backing the push to release more Epstein files, claiming they were siding with Democrats over him.\n\n“Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” he wrote.\n\nThis week is not the first time Trump’s current administration has faced controversy over the Epstein scandal. In February, for instance, Attorney General Bondi told Fox News in a televised interview that she had an Epstein “client list” in her possession: “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.”\n\nThe existence of a supposed “client list” was a key element in conspiracy theories that framed Epstein as blackmailing powerful figures to do his bidding. Some of Trump’s own officials, including Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head Kash Patel, had promoted that conspiracy theory prior to taking office.\n\nBut in July, the Justice Department and FBI issued a joint memo  denying the existence  of a “client list”, stirring backlash among Trump supporters. Bondi maintained she misspoke in the February interview with Fox News.\n\nLater that month,  media reports  emerged that Bondi had also briefed Trump that his name appeared in the full Epstein files, which have yet to be released.\n\nTrump himself addressed his relationship with Epstein that month,  saying he cut ties  with the financier for poaching young female employees from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\n“When I heard about it, I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people,'” Trump told reporters. “And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, ‘Out of here.'”\n\nClinton has likewise faced scrutiny for his ties to Epstein: Before his conviction, the financier visited Clinton at the White House, and Clinton has admitted to travelling on Epstein’s jet.\n\nWhile Clinton has yet to comment on Trump’s threat of an investigation, he has, in the past, denied any knowledge of Epstein’s abuses.\n\n“President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those he has been recently charged in New York,” Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Urena  posted  on social media in 2019.\n\nFinancial institutions have also faced pressure to account for their involvement in Epstein’s affairs.\n\nIn 2023, for instance, Deutsche Bank  agreed to pay a $75m  settlement to survivors of Epstein’s abuses, after a plaintiff alleged that the financial institution profited from his sex-trafficking schemes and failed to flag unusual behaviour.\n\nLater that same year, JP Morgan Chase also struck a deal with Epstein survivors,  agreeing to pay a settlement  of $290m.\n\n“We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes,” the bank said in a statement at the time.\n\nSimilar lawsuits have since been filed, including  complaints last month  against Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY). During hearings this week, those two banking firms have sought to have the lawsuits dismissed.\n\nStill, pressure remains high on the Trump administration, particularly in the wake of the House reconvening.\n\nWith the lower chamber back in session, a new representative was sworn in: Democrat Adelita Grijalva. She provided the critical 218th signature on a discharge petition to force the House to vote on releasing all of the government’s Epstein files.\n\nThe bill was a bipartisan effort, led by Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Ro Khanna, a Democrat.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump supporter, confirmed this week he plans to hold the vote next week, though it faces uncertain odds in the Senate. Johnson has repeatedly downplayed the effort.\n\n“It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it,” Johnson said as he walked with reporters on Wednesday. “I mean, they have 218 signatures. That’s fine. We’ll do it.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02+00:00","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant surge in bear attacks across Japan, particularly in Akita, Iwate, and Hokkaido, has prompted emergency responses, including military and police deployment.

behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure and recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine, has died at the age of 97.

Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/11/14/who-is-jeannette-jara-the-communist-leading-chiles-presidential-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:08:54+00:00","title":"Who is Jeannette Jara, the communist leading Chile’s presidential election?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jeannette Jara, a former labour minister and member of the Communist Party, has emerged as a leading candidate in Chile’s 2025 presidential election, marking the first time a communist has gained broad mainstream support since democracy returned in 1990.

election?\n\nVilla Alemana, Chile –  Cumbia music blasts from the speakers of a makeshift stage at a small, unassuming park in Villa Alemana, part of Chile’s central region.\n\nHundreds of locals crowd onto the paved park grounds. Pockets of friends dance together, and children race around their parents’ legs.\n\nThey have come to hear one of the frontrunners in Chile's presidential race: Jeannette Jara.\n\nA former labour minister, Jara is the nominee representing the leftist coalition in Sunday's election.\n\nBut it is her membership in the Communist Party that makes her presidential bid historic. Not since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 has a Communist candidate enjoyed such broad, mainstream support.\n\nFor some, Jara's success is a barometer for the economic malaise fuelling this year's election cycle. For others, her candidacy is a symptom of the growing polarisation within Chilean politics.\n\nJara has campaigned on the former, playing up her working-class roots. She has pledged to support Chile's public healthcare system, build affordable housing and raise wages.\n\n“Considering that politics generates so much mistrust, being able to gather like this, with hard-working people, really fills my heart,\" Jara, 51, told the crowd in Villa Alemana, dressed in blue jeans and a loose-fitting blazer rolled up at the sleeves.\n\n“It will be my priority to improve people's quality of life.\"\n\nThat emphasis on affordability — not to mention her surprise ascent to the head of the race — has earned Jara comparisons to another rising star on the left, Zohran Mamdani of the United States.\n\nIn June, both Jara and Mamdani scored pivotal, come-from-behind victories in their respective primaries.\n\nMamdani handily won the Democratic nomination for the New York City mayoral race, and Jara swept 60 percent of the primary vote to represent the governing Unity for Chile coalition in the presidential race.\n\nBoth results, announced within days of one another, signalled to some analysts a rejection of the centrist establishment on the left, in favour of bolder proposals and grassroots campaigns. Mamdani has since gone on to win New York City's general election.\n\nJara similarly sits atop the pre-election polls ahead of Chile's first round of voting.\n\nActiva Research, a polling firm, found that 24.9 percent of respondents planned to back Jara, compared to 16.9 percent for her next closest rival, far-right candidate Jose Antonio Kast.\n\nMireya Davila, a political science expert at the University of Chile, credits some of that momentum to Jara's backstory.\n\n“[Jara] has a lot of political instinct and personal charm,\" said Davila. “She came from the low-income sector and worked from the ground up.\"\n\nJara was born in Conchali, a working-class neighbourhood in the capital Santiago, one year into the brutal dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\n\nHis government, which lasted from 1973 to 1990, was marked by the repression of left-wing voices. Being a communist was illegal, and at least 3,065 people were killed during that time. Thousands more were tortured.\n\nThat period was also marked by high inflation and poverty. Suffering from financial hardships, Jara's father, a mechanic, left to work abroad in Brazil when she was only eight years old.\n\nAround the same time, her mother moved north to the city of Iquique to earn money in a restaurant. Jara and her siblings were briefly left in the care of their grandmother.\n\nBy age 13, Jara was working as a seasonal fruit harvester. By 14, she had joined the Communist Youth Party and was protesting Pinochet's rule.\n\nAs an adult, after the fall of Pinochet, she worked both in the public sector and with labour unions. Under President Michelle Bachelet, from 2016 to 2018, she served as undersecretary for social welfare.\n\nLater, as labour minister in the outgoing administration of President Gabriel Boric, she spearheaded initiatives to decrease the work week from 45 hours to 40 and reform Chile's privatised pension system.\n\nJara told the podcast El Bien Y El Mal last month that she initially thought her working-class roots would disqualify her from a presidential run.\n\n“I didn’t see how it was possible,\" she said, citing a lack of precedent. “Now I’m absolutely convinced: Having people from working-class origins as political leaders is necessary to fulfil democracy.”\n\nAt her campaign rally in Villa Alemana, supporters explained that they identified with Jara's down-to-earth persona.\n\n“It’s the first time a candidate has represented me so much,” said Isidora Hernandez, a 20-year-old student.\n\nAnother supporter, Clarissa Cofre, had travelled from a neighbouring town near Jara in person.\n\n“I wanted to get to know this senora!” the 87-year-old pensioner chuckled. “She speaks a common language, not like other politicians who talk with such exaggeration.\"\n\nJara has made affordability a pillar of her presidential bid. One of her campaign pledges is to increase the minimum wage from 529,000 Chilean pesos per month — about $560 — to 750,000 pesos, or $807.\n\nShe has argued that current minimum wage is not enough to scrape by in one of South America’s most expensive countries, where debt plagues 66 percent of Chileans.\n\nCofre, who worked in hospital administration for 20 years, believes Jara’s proposals will lead to positive change.\n\n“People need higher salaries, and also more job opportunities. There are too many people that are unemployed,\" she said.\n\nYet not all Chileans are convinced. Virginia Peredo, a domestic worker, told Al Jazeera she “would never” vote for the left-wing candidate, offering a blunt explanation: “She is a communist.\"\n\nPeredo was one of the nearly 200 supporters at a rally for Jara's right-wing rival Kast in Copiapo, a mining town some 750km (466 miles) north of Villa Alemana.\n\nMany of Kast's supporters believe that Jara stands for the status quo. Under President Boric, Jara's former boss, Chile saw a period of slow economic growth.\n\nBoric has also struggled to quell concerns about an increase in organised crime and undocumented immigration. Peredo, for instance, said she is afraid to leave the house at night.\n\nAlthough she moved to Chile from Bolivia 10 years ago, she supports Kast’s hardline stance, which includes militarising the country's borders and deporting all irregular immigrants.\n\n“The good ones can stay, but the bad ones have to go,” Peredo said of immigrants to Chile. \"They make us all look bad.\"\n\nKast, a 59-year-old Catholic and founder of the far-right Republican Party, has leaned into those fears of immigration and violence to build his base of support.\n\nA report released in April from the University of San Sebastian found that activity linked to organised crime increased by 8.4 percent between 2022 and 2023.\n\n“This is not a crisis. It’s an emergency,” Kast told his supporters in Copiapo.\n\nChristopher Sabatini, senior research fellow for Latin America at the think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera that Kast’s “iron-fisted approach to crime” has struck a chord among voters.\n\n“If you look at number-one demands, security, crime and immigration are all up there. Those are not what Jara is running on,” he said.\n\nSabatini sees parallels between Kast and the rise of other right-wing leaders, like Donald Trump in the United States and Javier Milei in Argentina.\n\nIn Milei's case, his victory in the 2023 presidential race was seen as a sign of discontent with the left-wing Peronist government that was in power at the time.\n\n“[Kast is] exploiting people’s fears very effectively, in the same way Milei was able to exploit people’s hate with 16 years of Peronism, and Trump was able to with immigration,\" Sabatini explained.\n\nEven though Jara is leading in the polls, experts warn Kast could overtake her, particularly if the presidential election progresses to a second round.\n\nEight candidates are currently in the running. If none of them wins a majority of votes on Sunday, there will be a run-off between the top two contenders on December 14.\n\nOne factor to consider is how the number of candidates is splitting the right-wing vote in the first round of the election, according to Davila, the political scientist at the University of Chile.\n\nThe conservative opposition did not hold a primary ahead of this year's election, so there are multiple candidates appealing to right-wing voters, including former Labour Minister Evelyn Matthei and member of Parliament Johannes Kaiser.\n\nShould the presidential election advance to a run-off, as expected, Davila explained that the last right-wing candidate left standing would be able to consolidate those votes.\n\n“The right is stronger, because [their candidates] add more votes,” said Davila.\n\nBut, Davila added, there is another wild card shaping the race: the return of compulsory voting.\n\nFor the first time since 2012, all eligible voters will be required to cast a ballot in the presidential race, or else face a fine.\n\nThe expected increase in voter turnout is slated to add a degree of uncertainty to the election's outcome. “Chile has an obligatory voting system, so it’s volatile,\" Davila said.\n\nAt Jara's rally in Villa Alemana, the atmosphere was jubilant despite the candidate's long odds.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the event, Jara argued it was her grassroots support that would buoy her at the ballot box.\n\n“Many times, those of us in politics are very good at talking, but we don’t listen to those in front of us,” she said. “I hope to always be in contact with the people.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629m7jm777o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:13:30.131+00:00","title":"Several killed after bus crashes into bus stop in Stockholm","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic crash on Valhallavägen in central Stockholm on Friday, a bus struck a bus stop pole, killing three people and injuring three others.

social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zexp2kp5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:58:06.698+00:00","title":"Man charged after suspected fake navy admiral at Llandudno Remembrance event","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 64-year-old man from Harlech, Gwynedd, named Jonathan Carley, has been charged with wearing military uniform and medals bearing the insignia of a high-ranking navy officer without authorization during a Remembrance Sunday wreath-laying service in Llandudno.

published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051q4pnz39o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:14:06.617+00:00","title":"Wicked: Man who grabbed Ariana Grande in Singapore charged in court","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Australian man named Johnson Wen was charged with public nuisance in Singapore after he jumped over a barricade and grabbed Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere.

space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:35:01.407+00:00","title":"What does Trump want with boat strikes near Venezuela and Caribbean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has conducted a sustained campaign of airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since September 2025, officially named Operation Southern Spear, under the Trump administration.

continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear.\n\nTens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US.\n\nThey have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nPresident Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets.\n\nIn a statement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nIn at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nIt is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.\n\nBetween 2 September and 13 November, US forces hit at least 21 vessels in 20 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nCollectively, at least 80 people have been killed.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nOne investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nIn a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".\n\nBut some legal experts have said strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that  he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity .\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.\n\nIn October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\n\n\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"\n\nAs part of the operation, the US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nThis force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, as well as a range of guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nAdditionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that he authorised  the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.\n\nThis build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the left-wing socialist government of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nOn 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\nMaduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace.\n\n\"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj97x2lere0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:17:56.606+00:00","title":"US justice department investigates Epstein's alleged ties to Clinton and banks after Trump request","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation into alleged connections between paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein and prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, following a public request from President Donald Trump.

[VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. While he was discussed in some of the messages released this week, he did not send or receive them.\n\nTraditionally, presidents do not direct the justice department to investigate individuals and companies and have often brought in special counsels - independent attorneys from outside the administration - to carry out investigations.\n\nIt is also rare for an administration to seek an investigation of a predecessor. However, the Biden administration started investigations tied to allegations that Trump tried to interfere with the 2020 election, which were then referred to a special counsel. The cases were dropped when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nRepresentative Robert Garcia, the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee, accused Trump of posting about possible investigations to \"deflect from serious new questions we have about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\n\nOn Friday, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said it would be \"huge miscalculation\" for Trump to oppose the release of material related to Epstein.\n\nGreene was among the four other House Republicans - Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, Thomas Massie - who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the files.\n\n\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Congress, Epstein survivors and the family of Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of his - called for US lawmakers to vote in favour of releasing the files.\n\n\"As you gather with your family this season, remember that your primary duty is to your constituents. Look into the eyes of your children, your sisters, your mothers, and your aunts,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"Imagine if they had been preyed upon. Imagine if you yourself were a survivor. What would you want for them? What would you want for yourself? When you vote, we will remember your decision at the ballot box.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zkrplpdyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:59:25.795+00:00","title":"US agrees deal to slash Swiss tariffs to 15% after golden charm offensive","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Switzerland and the United States have reached a landmark trade agreement to reduce tariffs on Swiss exports from 39% to 15%, aligning with EU standards.

2025-11-14T17:59:25.795+00:00\n\nTitle: US agrees deal to slash Swiss tariffs to 15% after golden charm offensive\n\nSwitzerland and the US have agreed to cut President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Swiss exports to 15%, as part of a deal that involves a Swiss promise to invest $200bn (£150bn) in the US.\n\n\"It's a great relief for our economy,\" said Swiss Economics Minister Guy Parmelin, who said significant damage had been done since the additional tariffs had kicked in last August.\n\nParmelin said a move by Swiss business leaders to meet Trump in the White House last week had proved \"decisive\" in reaching a deal.\n\nIndustry chiefs visited the Oval Office, bearing gifts including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS.\n\nInitial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind had fallen on deaf ears. Trump said she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".\n\nBut after the 4 November encounter with Swiss business leaders, Trump revealed this week a deal was being worked on.\n\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer  confirmed an agreement had been reached , saying \"President Trump's unmatched dealmaking continues to deliver for the American people\".\n\nThe deal had involved very hard work, said chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda. Guy Parmelin said it would bring Switzerland into line with the 15% tariff rate negotiated with the US by its European Union neighbours.\n\nThe economics minister said  it involved the Swiss economy investing $200bn directly in the US by 2028 . A third of that Swiss money will be invested in the US in 2026 under the deal.\n\nSwitzerland has also agreed to axe tariffs on a quota of US meat exports including beef, bison and poultry.\n\nGreer said the deal \"tears down longstanding trade barriers\" and Swiss investment would bring thousands of new jobs.\n\nFor Swiss industry, the deal could not come soon enough. Tech exports to the US are down 14.2% on the third quarter of last year,  according to latest statistics  - a dramatic fall since the tariff hike was imposed in August.\n\nThe role of Swiss industrialists appears to have been key, and some particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.\n\nIn September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour.\n\nThe president even asked if the Rolex CEO would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.\n\nLast week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.\n\nDays after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nA White House official has confirmed to the BBC the two items were given to Trump.\n\nIt is quite normal nowadays for visitors to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of the birth certificate of Trump's German grandfather.\n\nThe US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department.\n\nThey are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.\n\nSwiss industry has been waiting for a deal with bated breath and a number of Swiss companies had warned they would have to furlough staff if nothing changed.\n\nYves Bugmann, who heads the Swiss Watch Industry Federation, welcomed the deal after months of uncertainty.\n\nAsked what kind of investment the Swiss government might make in the US that would add up to $200bn, Helene Budliger Artieda said there was a detailed list that included pharmaceuticals, but she singled out plans for plane manufacturer Pilatus to build a big US plant and train-maker Stadler to expand its US operations in Utah.\n\nGold refining is also part of the plan.\n\n\"Currently, Switzerland is the primary location for gold storage, and New York is the primary location for trading,\" said trade negotiator.\n\nThe chief trade negotiator said it would take a few days or even weeks for the changes to come into effect.\n\nThe agreement will only become binding when it receives approval from the Swiss parliament, and then it will be put to a referendum."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jn94gyllo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:16:08.860+00:00","title":"Russian drone slams into block of flats in deadly wave of strikes across Kyiv","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of drone and missile attacks targeted Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions, with a Russian drone striking a residential building in the Lisovyi neighborhood, killing six and injuring dozens.

'mystery' of planeload of Palestinians, Cyril Ramaphosa says\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the \"mysterious\" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country.\n\nThe group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they \"did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports\", local authorities said.\n\nMost were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.\n\nSouth Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.\n\nRamaphosa said the group \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site.\n\nIsraeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".\n\nA statement from the embassy said \"an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\".\n\nThe BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment.\n\nOf the 153, 23 managed

the public on \"what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is\", according to public broadcaster SABC.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country.\n\nOnce it was established that the absence of this information \"did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum\" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry.\n\n\"All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,\" he said.\n\nSouth African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country.\n\nCivil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft.\n\nOne of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of \"peace, laws and justice\".\n\n\"We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,\" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children.\n\nGift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the \"humiliation they've caused\" the Palestinians.\n\nThe organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and \"using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking\".\n\nSouth Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\nThe country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nLarge pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.\n\nSmaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7pj543eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"03:16:48.227+00:00","title":"Canadian boycott of US travel shows no sign of slowing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to trade tariffs and political hostility from President Donald Trump, including 35% tariffs on Canadian goods and public statements such as calling Canada the '51st state,' a growing number of Canadians have begun boycotting US travel.

travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.\n\nBut those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\n\n\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.\n\nMs Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nOctober marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.\n\nOverall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.\n\nAs relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.\n\nIn the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.\n\nThey began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.\n\nCanada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.\n\nTrade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.\n\nMeanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".\n\nSome popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US.\n\nIn Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\n\n\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.\n\nMajor events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.\n\nStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.\n\nSome of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.\n\nMs Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\n\n\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"\n\nMs Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\n\n\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4y4z169go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"00:07:36.936+00:00","title":"Will AI mean better adverts or 'creepy slop'?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the rise of AI-powered, personality-driven advertising, where systems analyze users' social media activity, search history, and interactions with AI tools like ChatGPT to build detailed psychological profiles.

the ads start to look remarkably familiar. They're decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use.\n\nWelcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI.\n\nAdvertising company Cheil UK, for example, has been working with startup Spotlight on using large language AI models to understand people's online activity, and adapt that content based on what the AI interprets an individual's personality to be.\n\nThe technology can then mirror how someone talks in terms of tone, phrase and pace to change the text of an ad accordingly, and insert music and colours to match, say, whether the AI deems someone to be introverted or extroverted, or have specific preferences for loud or calm music, or light or dark colours.\n\nThe aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them.\n\nBrands in retail, consumer electronics, packaged goods, automotive, insurance and banking are already using the technology to create AI-enhanced, personality-driven ads to target online shoppers.\n\nThe AI is able to read what people post on public platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and other public forums - as well as someone's search history, and, most importantly, what people enter into ChatGPT.\n\nThen, with what it deduces about an individual's personality, the AI overlays that on top of what advertisers already know about people. For example, what part of the country you live in, what age bracket you're in, whether you have children or not, what your hobbies might be, where you go on holiday and what clothes you like to wear - information brands can already see through platforms like Facebook or Google.\n\nThat's why the jeans you've been searching online for magically appear in your inbox as a sponsored ad, or the holiday you've been searching for seems to follow you around the internet.\n\nThe difference is now AI can change the content of those ads, based on what it thinks your personality is, thanks to what it's been reading about you. It targets individual people, rather than the demographic segments or personas advertisers would traditionally use.\n\n\"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level,\" says Cheil UK CEO Chris Camacho.\n\n\"You've now got AI systems that can go in and explore your entire digital footprint - your entire online persona, from your social media interests to what you've been engaging in.\n\n\"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that's when you start to build a picture understanding that individual, so whether they're happy, whether they're sad, or what personal situation they're going through.\"\n\nAn added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output.\n\nResearchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes.\n\nThe study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn't mind that it had been written by AI.\n\n\"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it's still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile,\" explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research.\n\n\"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done],\" he adds.\n\nPersonalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising 'wastage' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go.\n\n\"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they've already forgotten it,\" says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible.\n\n\"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop.\"\n\nIvan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way.\n\n\"There's also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with,\" says London-based Mr Mato.\n\n\"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn't whether brands can personalise everything - it's whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do.\"\n\nAI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges.\n\n\"There's going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there's going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths,\" he says.\n\n\"And that's the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next.\n\nBut Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics.\n\n\"We don't have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We're trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We're trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that's all we've ever tried to do.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxk3w9277o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"01:21:48.544+00:00","title":"I could hardly walk - the issue that affects 1 in 5 mums","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pelvic girdle pain (PGP), a common condition affecting one in five pregnant women, can severely impact mobility and quality of life during and after pregnancy.

that affects 1 in 5 mums\n\nWhen Rebecca Middleton became pregnant, she had no idea that she would end up in a wheelchair for the final three months before she gave birth.\n\nRebecca had had a difficult first trimester dealing with nausea and sickness, and began to develop pelvic pain four months into her pregnancy.\n\n\"I could hardly walk, I'd always had some problems with lower back pain in my life. But nothing that significant and it escalated quite quickly,\" she says.\n\nAfter complaining about the pain, she was referred to an NHS physio, and eventually diagnosed with an extreme case of pelvic girdle pain (PGP), also known as symphysis pubic dysfunction.\n\nProblems with your pelvic joints are a common symptom of pregnancy, affecting one in five expectant mothers to some degree.\n\n\"I was terrified, would I ever walk again? How would I have my baby, how would I care for it?\"\n\nAfter giving birth, Rebecca was in less pain, but she still struggled with basic things like walking, lifting her son or pushing a pram.\n\n\"I was disabled for seven months and had to have someone helping me all the time,\" she says.\n\n\"I just couldn't do the things that you should be able to do in looking after a baby, it was a really challenging time.\"\n\nPrior to becoming pregnant, it was an issue Rebecca was unaware of and since her experience she volunteers for The Pelvic Partnership, a charity which helps raise awareness and support women with this condition.\n\nIt says the condition is treatable with the right action.\n\nAs soon as your symptoms start, the charity advises you get hands-on individualised treatment, including manual therapy, and ask for a referral for NHS physiotherapy from your GP or midwife.\n\nIf you aren't offered this support initially, the charity suggests going back to your GP or midwife and asking for a second opinion.\n\nThey can also refer you to maternal mental health support to help you manage the emotional impacts of living with PGP.\n\nDr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says higher awareness and early assessment could prevent patients like Rebecca needing wheelchairs or crutches.\n\n\"Without that early identification based on a really good understanding of the female body, we leave some of these women with negative effects for life,\" she says.\n\nVictoria Roberton, co-ordinator at the Pelvic Partnership, is an example of how awareness can help.\n\nLike Rebecca, she didn't know what PGP was when she began experiencing the condition during her first pregnancy.\n\nShe tried to stay as active as possible as advised and was referred to NHS physio sessions online and by phone, but found the pain worsening as her pregnancy progressed.\n\n\"They gave us exercises, stretches to do. By this point I couldn't do any of them. It was too painful,\" she says.\n\nIt got to the point where even sitting became uncomfortable for Victoria, and she was largely homebound until her baby was born.\n\nThe pain lessened after the birth of her daughter, but she began experiencing the same problem when she became pregnant with her second child.\n\nIt's not an option for many mothers, but Victoria said given her medical history she decided to pay for a private physio as the NHS wait for referral was long.\n\nThe physio gave her a full assessment and hands-on treatment including joint mobilisation, and taught her different ways to move her body to not aggravate her hip joints, which helped ease the pain.\n\nVictoria still struggles with a degree of PGP today, four years on, but her second pregnancy was much easier to manage because she understood her condition and how to handle it.\n\nRebecca's second pregnancy has been similarly a much more positive experience.\n\nThis time round she knew she was at risk of PGP and was able to have it treated throughout her pregnancy before it became debilitating.\n\nShe has made a full recovery from PGP, just two months post birth compared to  two years for her first child.\n\n\"I'm probably in better shape now than I was before either of my children because I now know what caused that pelvic girdle pain, and have had it fully treated and resolved with manual therapy,\" she says.\n\n\"It was five years of hell because of the pain I was in because of a lack of knowledge and understanding about the subject.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5z3gg45jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:33:41.896+00:00","title":"Bad Bunny wins five Latin Grammys ahead of Super Bowl","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the 2025 Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas, Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny won five awards, including Album of the Year for his album Debí Tirar Más Fotos, which blends Puerto Rican traditions with reggaetón.

as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, by London's High Court.\n\nThe dam collapse killed 19 people, polluted the river and destroyed hundreds of homes.\n\nThe civil lawsuit, representing more than 600,000 people including civilians, local governments and businesses, had been valued at up to £36bn ($48bn).\n\nBHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit and has said many claimants in the London lawsuit had already been paid compensation in Brazil.\n\nThe dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.\n\nThe claimants' lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \"were in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\".\n\nA separate claim against Samarco's second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, was filed in the Netherlands, with more than 70,000 plaintiffs.\n\nThe dam was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud. The sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people's homes and poisoning the river.\n\nJudge Finola O'Farrell said in her High Court ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the dam's collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.\n\nBHP is expected to appeal the ruling.\n\nPresident of BHP's Minerals Americas, Brandon Craig, said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit \"have already been paid compensation in Brazil\".\n\n\"We believe this will significantly reduce the size and value of claims in the UK group action,\" he added.\n\nThe lawsuit has been littered with different clashes between the UK firm representing the claimants, Pogust Goodhead, and BHP.\n\nBHP always denied liability and said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil.\n\nBHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims. It has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace the town of Novo Bento and has disbursed billions of dollars in repair and compensation actions to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nIn June, a presentation by BHP and Vale's Samarco venture said around 130,000 people in Brazil had reached settlements with them. In response, Pogust Goodhead alleged the companies had pressured claimants to \"settle their claims at far below their true value\" and that it would seek £1.3bn in unpaid fees lost as a result.\n\nIt alleged that a $30.3bn compensation agreement which Brazil signed with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October 2024 prevented claimants from discussing the deal with the firm or paying its legal fees.\n\nThe firm said it had incurred $1bn in borrowing costs to finance the English case.\n\nBHP said it rejected Pogust Goodhead's allegations in their entirety and dispute \"their factual and legal basis.\"\n\nIt said the claims were \"without merit\" and BHP would \"vigorously contest them.\" A spokesperson also said that the firm continued to believe Brazil was the most appropriate, effective, and efficient place for compensation for the dam collapse.\n\nBut there were also parallel claims that Pogust Goodhead – which promotes itself as a firm representing human rights and environmental law – had tried to profit off \"vulnerable\" Brazilians.\n\nDuring proceedings the firm was accused of \"misleading\" vulnerable Brazilians for its own gain by a Brazilian judge in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\nPogust Goodhead rejected the accusation at the time as \"without merit\".\n\nIn a claim brought by the Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders in Brazil against Pogust Goodhead, the judge criticised several \"allegedly abusive clauses\" in Pogust Goodhead's contracts with Brazilians who suffered damage.\n\nAmong these, it alleges the law firm engaged in \"misleading advertising\" considering the \"hypervulnerability of those affected\".\n\nIt also alleges \"undue charging of fees on compensation amounts obtained extrajudicially in Brazil\" which it said represents \"illicit enrichment that diverts essential resources from those affected\" and \"excessive\" penalties for claimants who terminated their contracts which it said \"discouraged\" them from joining national compensation programmes.\n\nThe former Brazilian ambassador in London and Washington, Rubens Barbosa, told the BBC earlier this year that he believed this amounted to spreading misleading information in Brazil.\n\nMr Barbosa said bringing the case to London \"hinders efforts to resolve the matter locally\" and the \"extremely vulnerable Brazilians were misled\" by contracts."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33p0pd6x2mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:18:20.046+00:00","title":"Aberdeen University friends finish 17,000-mile bike ride started in 1985","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three friends from Aberdeen University—Sophie Trafford, Rona Hulbert, and Craig Swan—completed the final leg of a 17,000-mile mountain bike journey that began in 1985, finishing in Villa O'Higgins, Chile.

challenge they did in the 1980s.\n\nSophie Trafford, Rona Hulbert and Craig Swan met at Aberdeen University and were in their 20s when they cycled from Punta Arenas in Chile to Anchorage in Alaska.\n\nThere was no road through a remote section of Patagonia in southern Chile and the trio had to take a ferry, but since then about 800 miles of road has been built.\n\nFollowing their 26-day ride Craig, 62, said: \"Forty years is a long time to complete a journey.\"\n\nThe bike ride has raised money for a Maggie's cancer centre in Forth Valley and the Epilepsy Research Institute.\n\nSophie, who worked in corporate finance and lives in Balfron, near Stirling, said: \"For me, the physical challenge in this journey has been enormous.\n\n\"There were many times when I thought it was beyond me, so the sense of achievement is enormous.\"\n\nSophie's son Hector died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and memories of him inspired her during the ride.\n\n\"There can be no more spiritual place to do this journey than Patagonia,\" said the 62-year-old.\n\n\"The mountains, the glacial rivers, the vast expanse of unspoiled remote landscape are places that Hector would have loved and coming here has made him feel very close as we have travelled through this amazing, inspiring place.\"\n\nRona, also 62 and from Newmills in Fife, said her experience of having breast cancer changed her life.\n\n\"I lost all my confidence after my diagnosis and treatment, so to bring the three of us together again to complete the missing link in our journey has been such a healing process,\" she said.\n\nRona said the cycling pushed her to her limits and reaching the end of the road was \"very emotional\".\n\nShe added: \"We started our journey 40 years ago, young and full of hope and confidence.\n\n\"Now we are all older, not the same people we were all those years ago.\n\n\"But in these past weeks we have found the same spirit that we had in our young selves and together I hope we have raised awareness, and money, for these causes that are so close to our hearts.\"\n\nFormer BBC journalist Craig, who lives in Grantown on Spey in the Highlands,  said his friends' personal stories of loss had been a powerful driving force during the trip.\n\nHe said: \"For me, to join my oldest friends to complete this chapter in our lives has been a deeply moving privilege.\n\n\"We are all feeling tired, exhilarated and proud.\"\n\nThe friends cycled south along the whole length of a road called Carretera Austral.\n\nThey finished in Villa O'Higgins, a small town in southern Chile."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77zgmg6d76o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:25:57.111+00:00","title":"King Charles

Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, who was disqualified from pursuing it.\n\nWhat the change means for the future of the case was unclear. The new prosecutor, Pete Skandalakis, is a veteran Georgia lawyer who began his career as a Democrat and later switched to the Republican Party. As executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, Mr. Skandalakis had been tasked by law with finding a new prosecutor to take on the complex Trump case after Ms. Willis was removed by the Georgia appellate court.\n\nIn a filing in Fulton County Superior Court on Friday, Mr. Skandalakis said he reached out to “several prosecutors” in the state, but that each of them declined the appointment. So he said he decided to take on the case himself.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Skandalakis said that while it would have “been simple” to tell the court he could not find a replacement for Ms. Willis — a move that would have likely led to its prompt dismissal — he decided that would not be “the right course of action.”\n\n“The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case,” Mr. Skandalakis said. “Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”\n\nAs the new prosecutor, Mr. Skandalakis now has the authority to steer the case in a number of directions, including taking it to trial as it is, striking plea deals, drop some charges, or striking the case altogether.\n\n“He would have the same prosecutorial discretion afforded to any sitting prosecutor,” said Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University. “He does have the obligation under Georgia law to review every individual case for which probable cause for prosecution exists, and to make a determination based on an analysis of the facts whether to proceed. And he has an ethical obligation to not pursue charges where he doesn’t believe he could secure a conviction.”\n\nIn a statement on Friday morning, Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump’s lead defense lawyer in Georgia, said, “This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end.

stay on top\n\nThere are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them.\n\nAs one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction.\n\nAccording to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a  movie adaptation  is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts.\n\nBut this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands.\n\nBattlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor.\n\nAnd long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots.\n\nThe clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to  fan concerns about the series losing its way .\n\nIt has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance.\n\nThey're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj.\n\nBut when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash.\n\nFans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have  included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025 .\n\nActivision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously.\n\nIt's also being released after parent company Microsoft  increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20% , angering many players.\n\nWhen BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign.\n\nThe equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes.\n\nBlack Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies.\n\nBlack Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company.\n\nNatalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't.\n\n\"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says.\n\n\"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\"\n\nBeing one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects.\n\nFor Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia.\n\nKiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans.\n\nShe says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\"\n\n\"I love a fandom,\" she says.\n\n\"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool.\n\n\"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be.\n\n\"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\"\n\nAs someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have.\n\n\"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says.\n\nAsked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint.\n\n\"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says.\n\nBut Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year.\n\nThe game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed.\n\nWhen they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\".\n\nAs for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer.\n\n\"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun.\n\n\"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life.\n\n\"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and  relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat  live  at

lifer who worked his way up from the shop floor and now serves as head of the company's US business.\n\nThe change comes as the retailer has experienced solid growth, despite uncertainty generated by new tariffs and signs of slowing consumer spending.\n\nWalmart chairman Greg Penner said Mr McMillon had left the company in a stronger position than when he started in the role in 2014, when the rise of e-commerce had put the firm on the defensive.\n\n\"Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernising our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance,\" he said in a statement announcing the plans.\n\nWalmart, which reported roughly $680bn in revenue last year, has a sprawling global footprint, with more than 10,000 stores in 19 countries.\n\nBut under Mr McMillon, Walmart behaved like a \"small business\" - moving quickly to experiment as it worked to find its footing in the world of online retail, said Neil Saunders, managing director at consultancy GlobalData.\n\nSuccess was mixed. For example, the company offloaded menswear brand Bonobos in 2023 at a loss just six years after buying it.\n\nBut online purchases now represent a key growth driver for the firm.\n\n\"I think he'll be remembered as a leader that was transformational,\" Mr Saunders said. \"He's taken a very good business and he's made it even better, which is a very difficult thing to do.\"\n\nMr McMillon will remain an adviser to Mr Furner and continue to serve on the board of the company through June 2026 to help with the transition, the company said.\n\nMr McMillon said in a statement that it had been a \"great honour\" to serve as chief executive, while praising 51-year-old Mr Furner as \"uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation\".\n\nMr Furner has been in charge of Walmart's US business since 2019, helping to steer it through the pandemic's supply chain disruptions and jump in prices that followed.\n\nThe business has also successfully weathered the abrupt changes in tariffs this year, using its scale to help keep price rises in check and make gains against competitors. Sales increased nearly 5% in the US in the most recent quarter.\n\nHe had long been floated as a likely successor to Mr McMillon.\n\nShares in the firm, which are up about 14% this year, fell about 2% in opening trading as investors reacted to the news   but later clawed back some ground."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"08:39:44.636+00:00","title":"China and Japan in escalating spat over Taiwan: What to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China and Japan are engaged in a sharp diplomatic confrontation over remarks made by Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who suggested that Japan could activate its self-defence forces in response to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

know\n\nChina has summoned the Japanese ambassador in Beijing over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan.\n\nChina and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words this week, set off by Takaichi's suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan.\n\nBoth countries' foreign ministries have lodged serious protests with each other. A Chinese diplomat also made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi.\n\nThe spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about it:\n\nThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\n\n\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.\n\nA \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.\n\nTakaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".\n\nOn Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".\n\nWhile the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.\n\nTokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.\n\nXue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on.\n\nThen on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\".\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness.\n\nSun called Takaichi's remarks \"extremely wrong and dangerous\" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that \"otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan\".\n\nJapan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan \"has not changed\" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,\" he said during the daily news briefing.\n\nKihara also added that Japan \"strongly urged China to take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media comment.\n\nThere is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.\n\nThis was referenced in a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday when it said that \"should Japan fail to draw lessons from history and dare to take reckless risks, even resorting to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses and pay a bitter price in the face of the iron wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\".\n\nHistorical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe ,  suggests more tensions may lie ahead.\n\nThe conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.\n\nTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan.\n\nShe had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.\n\nChina is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.\n\nOn the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nIn 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".\n\nIn this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\n\n\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\n\n\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/stock-market-valuation-worry.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:10:18-05:00","title":"Stock Market Rally Is Dented as Signs of Worry Emerge","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite remaining near record highs, the stock market has shown signs of instability as investors grow wary of overvaluation and economic fragility.

2025-11-14T10:10:18-05:00\n\nThe recent wobble in stocks has revealed signs of anxiety in markets, in what some investors consider a mere stumble and others an indication of worse to come.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell roughly 1 percent in early trading on Friday. The index is on course for a second straight weekly decline for the first time since June. But stocks are still close to record highs, reflecting a curious mix of optimism and worry among investors as they try to plot the direction of markets.\n\nOn the plus side, companies in the S&P 500 are set to record a fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth, according to FactSet, a feat last achieved in 2021, during the burst of activity after the end of pandemic lockdowns.\n\nMore than 90 percent of companies on the S&P 500 have released their financial results for the third quarter, reporting an average earnings growth of 13 percent compared with last year. The index is also about 13 percent higher from a year ago.\n\nAnd although executives try to steer analysts’ earnings expectations to levels that they can beat — part of the farce of the quarterly earnings season — the share of companies beating those expectations has been higher than normal, a meaningful signal for investors.\n\n“We are seeing companies doing better than expected and that supports these valuations,” said Alan McKnight, chief investment officer at Regions Bank.\n\nHowever, worries linger about how long this can last.\n\nWary of high valuations and potential market potholes, investors are punishing companies that miss earnings expectations more harshly than usual, which some analysts say is an indicator that they are more attuned to signs of stress than shows of strength. On average, companies in the S&P 500 that missed earnings expectations by more than 2 percent fell roughly 4 percent immediately after, while those that beat expectations by more than 2 percent gained only just over 1 percent, according to data from Fundstrat and FactSet.\n\nIt is hard not to worry, investors said, when valuations have risen so quickly, propelled by bets on the profit potential of artificial intelligence. Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group, pointed to the surge in gold prices this year as another sign of underlying worry, despite stock markets also rising at the same time.\n\n“That is a bipolar market environment where you have fear of missing out at the same time as real fear,” she said.\n\nShe also worries about the dependence of the market and the economy on the growth of A.I., which has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, bolstering economic growth and pushing the value of major industry players to unprecedented heights.\n\nA basket of A.I.-linked stocks tracked by Jefferies, an investment bank, has underperformed on the S&P 500 this month, as investors have appeared to shift their attention to other parts of the market.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward tech stocks, fell about half a percent on Friday, its sixth decline in the past seven trading sessions.\n\nToward the end of the year, investors also typically look to book profits on winning trades, dialing down their appetite for new investments.\n\n“I think we are in the final innings before a significant drawdown,” Ms. Hooper said.\n\nInvestors are also fretting about the effects of a growing economic divide between those who have profited from the roaring market rally and those with lower incomes and little exposure to stocks, who continue to struggle as inflation remains stubborn and the labor market slows.\n\n“The gap between high and low income consumers just keeps widening,” said Hardika Singh, a market strategist at Fundstrat. That suggests that the economy may not be on the sturdiest of foundations: The top 10 percent of U.S. households now account for nearly half of all spending, the highest share since the late 1980s, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\nThe lingering impact of the longest-ever government shutdown, which postponed the release of widely followed economic data reports, is also on investors’ minds.\n\nFew companies on the S&P 500 noted any significant effects on their businesses from the shutdown. But the index includes only the biggest companies in the country, which are generally better able to deal with economic shocks.\n\nSmaller companies have seemed to fare worse. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, is on course for its third straight week of losses, its longest losing streak since March.\n\nNext week, major earnings reports could further test investors’ ability to balance competing narratives, with high-flying Nvidia, the standard-bearer of the A.I. boom, releasing results alongside the retailers Walmart and Target, bellwethers for lower-income consumers squeezed by the economy.\n\n“As pleased as we have been,” Mr. McKnight of Regions Bank said, “our big question as we start next week and into late November and December is are the retailers feeling a pinch? Are they seeing a pullback from the consumer?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/paul-kingsnorth-humanity-technology.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"The Impact of Social Media on Public Opinion and Democracy: A Study on Misinformation and Digital Literacy","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent study explores the profound impact of social media on public opinion and political discourse.

That some kind of apocalypse is all but inevitable — if it isn’t already upon us. That what’s needed now are strategies of resistance, endurance and escape.\n\nAnd he practices what he preaches, having retreated to the west of Ireland with his family — the better to keep them out of the clutches of what he calls the machine.\n\nBut he’s come back to us, for a time, bearing a prophetic message.\n\nPaul Kingsnorth is a novelist and a critic, an environmental activist and a convert to Eastern Orthodoxy. His new book is “Against the Machine: On the Unmaking of Humanity.”\n\nBelow is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nRoss Douthat: Paul Kingsnorth, welcome to “Interesting Times.”\n\nPaul Kingsnorth: Thank you very much. I think that’s a good thing, but I’m not sure.\n\nDouthat: We’ll find out. But we’re going to start with your life because you don’t just critique technological civilization; you have also at least somewhat withdrawn from it.\n\nYou’re here in New York City promoting this book, but once book promotion is done, you’ll return to Western Ireland, where you have lived for some time with your wife and children. Can you tell me about that?\n\nKingsnorth: I live on a few acres of land in a little house in County Galway in Ireland.\n\nYou can probably tell from my accent that I don’t come from Ireland. I come from England. I grew up in urban England. I worked there for a long time. I lived there for a long time. But both my wife and I were quite clear for a long time that we wanted to try and escape the machine, escape the rat race if we could. When you have children, it really focuses you on the shape of the world, the stories you want to tell them, the life you want to live. And we wanted to home-school our children. We wanted to teach them ourselves. We wanted to give them some time in nature. We wanted to take them away from the screens, which are enveloping absolutely every aspect of education and life for children.\n\nSo we jumped ship, left England, and we moved to rural Ireland as a kind of life experiment. We wanted to grow food, we wanted to try to be semi-self-sufficient, try to be rooted in a place.\n\nThat’s what we’ve been doing for about 12 years. And we’re still at it. It’s been pretty glorious, actually, considering that we jumped in with both feet to see what would happen.\n\nDouthat: How old are your kids now?\n\nKingsnorth: They’re 14 and 17 now.\n\nDouthat: So they were very young?\n\nKingsnorth: They were very young when we moved out there, 3 and 6, I think.\n\nDouthat: And so you’ve been home-schooling them and farming. Tell me about the farming.\n\nKingsnorth: It’s smallholding. It’s what you would call homesteading, I think, rather than farming. We have a vegetable garden; we have some orchards; we grow our own firewood.\n\nDouthat: Do you have electricity?\n\nKingsnorth: We do have electricity. I’d really like to go off-grid, but we haven’t managed to do that. Maybe in the future.\n\nDouthat: You mentioned getting away from screens, the tyranny, the omnipresence of screens. But you don’t just write books from your rural retreat; you also have a Substack. How do you navigate your own relationship to the internet? Is there like an internet hour?\n\nKingsnorth: It’s a constant battle. I actually have a little cabin out in our field that has an internet connection. So I can go out there and write and leave my computer there, then come back into the house and force myself away from it.\n\nI don’t do social media. I don’t have a smartphone. That’s not because I’m highly virtuous. It’s because I know that if I did, I’d be on it all the time like everyone else.\n\nDouthat: You would?\n\nKingsnorth: Because that’s how it works.\n\nDouthat: Yeah.\n\nKingsnorth: And we do it with our children. They’ve never had phones. They have laptops now for school. But there are hours when they can use them and hours when they can’t.\n\nI think it’s a good thing. It can sound like it’s very puritanical and restrictive and you’re forcing people not to do things. But it’s liberating, actually, in a way, very liberating for children. They have more freedom to actually be young people.\n\nDouthat: Is there a shock to coming back to civilization?\n\nYou’re on book tour through the United States. You’re here in Manhattan, near Times Square, the belly of the beast. Do you feel assaulted by the tech in the world?\n\nKingsnorth: I feel more and more assaulted. I lived in greater London till I was 11. I grew up in cities. I lived in Oxford, England, for a long time. It’s not as big as New York, but I’ve been in plenty of cities.\n\nIt’s not a shock to come to a city. It’s a bit of an assault on the senses when you live out in rural Ireland, certainly, but it is interesting how much more technological and screen-based everything is.\n\nI just drove through Times Square on the way here — and I have been there before — but just the sheer number of flashing lights, the sheer number of screens, huge billboards of virtually naked women, technology everywhere.\n\nDouthat: But also the reality that no one’s looking at these huge, flashing screens. Everyone’s walking through Times Square staring down at their phone.\n\nKingsnorth: To me, it always seems like a revolutionary situation because this has only been going on for 10 or 15 years. I think the iPhone was first sold in 2007. It’s not long ago at all. And we very, very quickly got into this situation where everyone’s staring down at the screen if they’re not surrounded by screens.\n\nIt takes a huge effort to stay out of it, and society makes it very difficult for you. Your work makes it very difficult for you. This is really what I’m talking about when I talk about the machine. It’s what I’m trying to write about in this book: There is a system that is surrounding us that is almost closing around us like a net.\n\nIf we actually step out of it for a minute and look at it from the outside, we’ve become utterly dependent on this web of technology that’s around us. It’s a radical situation — and it’s a very strange one — and it’s been normalized because it’s just happened so steadily. Yet, at the same time, almost everyone has a level of discomfort about it.\n\nDouthat: So let’s go a little further with definitions here. The machine is the iPhone, but it’s not just the iPhone. It is the internet, but it’s not just the internet. You said it’s a net that’s been closing around us for a long time. Give me a history of the machine.\n\nKingsnorth: So this phrase, the machine, is not my phrase.\n\nIt’s very deliberately lifted from greater writers of the past. It’s a word that writers from Mary Shelley onward for 200 years, at least since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution — poets, writers, artists, filmmakers — have been using to try and get some kind of grip on this system that’s been building around us since we first invented the steam engine.\n\nI think the technologies we’re talking about here — the phones and the screens and whatever else we’re using — are not so much the machine as a manifestation of it. The machine is a giant technological, economic, cultural system, which actually stems from a particular way of seeing. A peculiarly modern way of seeing, in which we move away from the relationship to culture that we had in the past, the relationship to nature, and especially the relationship to religion, the relationship to God. And we take the scientific revolution. We take the Enlightenment, we take the technological and the industrial revolutions, and they become almost a new theology. It’s really ultimately a war against nature, including human nature using technology.\n\nSo we’ve got to the point now where this thing that we might call the machine is closing around us to such a degree that we feel like cogs in it, but it’s very difficult to take us out of it.\n\nIt’s moving toward, very openly, a situation in which we are trying to conquer death, abolish disease, terraform new planets, recreate the whole of nature, create artificial food, replace our bodies with technology and effectively behave as if we were gods using technology to build a new world.\n\nDouthat: We will get to possible defenses of “the machine,” and I will offer arguments on behalf of the changes you’ve described.\n\nBut first I want to take up an idea that is sometimes implicit and sometimes explicit in your writing, and that is that this is a path to destruction. And it seems to me that there are two intertwined visions of that destruction in your book and in your arguments.\n\nOne is a vision essentially of a dehumanization and imprisonment of humans beings sort of trapped permanently in the machine and thus losing something essential about their humanity. And the second is a vision of ecological destruction. And I want to take those each in turn.\n\nYou’ve been a writer your whole life, but early on you were also an environmental activist. Can you talk a little bit about the relationship between the machine and nature?\n\nKingsnorth: Yeah. It was really a love of nature that took me into all of these inquiries in the first place. I used to go on long walks with my dad when I was young. Moving out of the suburbs and up into the mountains really gave me a sense of something that I hadn’t experienced before, and that drove me into environmental activism and environmental writing for a long time. And I think there’s something deeply unholy and sacrilegious and destructive about a culture that can ravage the natural world to the degree that we’re ravaging it now.\n\nI think that if you have managed to change the climate of an entire planet, if you’ve managed to destroy its forests, if you’ve managed to poison its oceans with plastic, if you’ve managed to kick off the sixth mass extinction — and that’s the situation we’re in, and if it’s this thing we call “the machine” that is doing that, this global economic industrial system is doing that, then you’ve got a major problem in your relationship with the natural world.\n\nDouthat: What do you make of the argument that the only way to avoid climate destruction are technological solutions? In the sense that there’s always been kind of a divide in the environmentalist movement between people offering the kind of thoroughgoing critique of modern civilization, like the one that you’re offering, and people who are saying our technology has created problems and we need to find technological fixes for those problems. That means electric cars. It means wind power. It means solar power and alternative forms of energy. And only out of that can you stave off the worst-case climate scenarios.\n\nKingsnorth: I’ve been writing and thinking about it for a long time. When the green movement began, it was very much focused on back-to-the-land solutions. Living a simple life and changing society so that it became much more simple and much less materialistic. That didn’t happen.\n\nVery clearly, the direction of travel is toward more machine all the time, and so the green movement has effectively now become a movement which promotes, at least in the mainstream, these technological solutions for perfectly rational reasons. We’re not going to stop climate change by all living simple lives on farms and by turning off the industrial machine. That’s clearly not happening.\n\nSo it makes logical sense to say: Great, we need wind farms and we need solar panels. And to some degree that’s a good idea. I mean, it’s a good idea to use wind farms and solar panels instead of burning coal, very clearly. If we’re going to have advanced technology, we need to make it as sustainable as possible. But we’re also getting to the point where the green movement is embracing things which I would regard as quite dehumanizing and unnatural.\n\nFor example: The replacement of farming with vat-grown food, which is becoming fashionable in some sorts of green tech quarters. And again, you come back to the question of: What are our limits here? Where do we actually stop?\n\nWhat do we mean by sustainability? Do we mean sustaining the progress of machine civilization? Just without producing carbon in a way that is not ecological? Or do we mean a society which actually is culturally and ecologically sustainable, where we can live human lives? Can we have a kind of green dehumanization, if you like? I think potentially you could.\n\nDouthat: It seems to me, and you can tell me if this is wrong, that there’s been a shift in your writing and emphasis over the years. You were sort of a pantheist Zen Buddhist; you practiced Wicca for a while and then you converted to Orthodox Christianity. And maybe tracking with that conversion, I feel like you still have a strong emphasis on the environment and ecology, but maybe there’s more emphasis on what happens to the human mind and the human soul under these technological conditions.\n\nKingsnorth: Yeah, I think that’s probably true. As you say, I’ve been on a kind of long and very winding spiritual search for about 15 years, which ultimately ended up in me becoming an Orthodox Christian. Which is something I wouldn’t have predicted a decade ago. But since arriving there, the pattern of everything makes a lot more sense.\n\nI think my concern for the destruction of the natural world, which was very profound for a long time, very intense, hasn’t disappeared, but somehow it’s subsided a little since I became a Christian.\n\nI think partly that’s because if you become a Christian, it isn’t possible to be a catastrophist in quite the same way. Because if you’re a Christian, you don’t believe everything ultimately is in the hands of humanity. There’s an end point to history. There’s something or someone who is bigger than us.\n\nWhereas if you have a more materialist worldview, if you have a more atheist or even agnostic worldview — and this is one of the things that drives the green movement — there’s a great sense of fear. Because you think: Oh, no, look at all this destruction we’re carrying out, and it’s all on us. Then we have to control it. We have to manage it. There’s nothing bigger than us. There’s no pattern to the history. If we don’t stop the climate changing, we’re all dead. If we don’t stop the forests falling, we’re all dead.\n\nThere can’t be any outside intervention in that way of thinking, if you like. There’s no bigger pattern. And because I do now see what I regard as a bigger pattern, it’s not that I don’t care about those things — I do — but as you say, I’m more concerned now with the dehumanization of us as people.\n\nAnd that’s also partly because of the rapid acceleration of technology and especially the rapid acceleration in the arrival of A.I., which is another quantum leap in the direction of the machine. And if A.I. systems are able to do even half of what their boosters say they’re going to be able to do in the next five years, then they’re going to make smartphones look like a bowl of cornflakes or something. It’s going to be a radical change. Even deeper alienation, not just from other people in the world around us, but from ourselves and from our understanding of what it even means to be a human.\n\nSo if this whole thing has been a war against nature, then the last part of the war against nature is the war against human nature. And I think that when we start to talk about creating artificial life, creating new intelligences, uploading our minds, all the stuff that comes out of Silicon Valley theology at the moment, that’s where we are. This is the war against human nature, which is presented as the next stage in progress.\n\nDouthat: So let me now try and make a case for modernity, just for a minute. Because you mentioned the Christian idea of directionality in history.\n\nFrom a Christian perspective, which is part of where the modern narrative of progress came from in the first place, we aren’t just stuck in endless cycles. We’re actually going somewhere. There’s a destination. And one reading of the last 200 years as a kind of counterpoint to your own would be to say basically, of course, modern technology is incredibly dangerous and has all kinds of downsides. And the story of modernity is a story of invention followed by constant battles to tame the machine and make it serve human beings rather than the other way around.\n\nOut of this struggle, you get atomic bombs and poison gas in World War I, but you also get vaccines, airplanes, whatever miracle of modern science someone happens to appreciate and favor.\n\nIn that case, this moment with the smartphone, the digital life, it’s just another moment, where of course the peril is great, but the point is to struggle to master the thing. Not to say the whole process was a mistake.\n\nWhat do you make of that part Kingsnorth, part Pangloss kind of take?\n\nKingsnorth: No, this is the argument, and to some degree it’s possible to look back on this. And you can look way back beyond the modern period in the West to the Roman Empire or to the civilization of pharaonic Egypt. And you can see these giant technological civilizations rising and falling.\n\nSo in that way, this thing called the machine is not just something that’s popped up in the last few hundred years here. It’s part of our human psyche in some way. Something that emerges in different places in history and rises and falls and disappears.\n\nIf you wanted to look at it from a Christian perspective, another way you could look at it is by opening the Bible and going to the first chapter of Genesis and seeing what happens in the garden when God tells us to exist, to tend and keep the creation he’s given us. And we choose instead to eat this fruit which gives us the knowledge of good and evil because the serpent tells us that if we do, we can be as gods and we choose to be as gods.\n\nAnd we then fall out of relationship with God and out of relationship with creation and into civilization. And the next thing you know, we’re building the Tower of Babel. We’re trying to build this great technological effort.\n\nDouthat: Cain built the first city.\n\nKingsnorth: Cain builds the first city. And before we know it, we’ve got the first global civilization building a tower to the stars and God has to scatter us.\n\nDouthat: And it ended badly.\n\nKingsnorth: And it doesn’t end well. So I mean, there are two ways of looking at it if you want to look at it from that perspective.\n\nDouthat: But in the same beginning of Genesis, God also tells people to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. And depending on your translation, subdue it. And so there’s some tension there where, yes, we ate the fruit of the tree, and that means that our building, our stewardship is not what it should be.\n\nBut it certainly doesn’t remove the impulse to build and create. It’s not clear that God just wanted us to live in the garden forever.\n\nKingsnorth: So what’s the obligation? That’s the question. Clearly, if you step back into a kind of secular way of looking at it, there’s no way of being human without technology or tools. As soon as we are human, we are building, we are making fires, even language, we’re creating complex language, which is a tool, we’re using sticks to dig holes in the ground. It’s technology and our ability to create it, which allows us to literally fill the earth there.\n\nThere are humans on every continent, including Antarctica. And so in that sense, our relationship to technology is not something that you can retreat from or go back from or hide from. The question is what does the technology serve? What are the tools doing? What should your relationship with nature and with God and with society and culture be?\n\nThe big question for me: Is there a point at which you can stop and say, actually, we’re not going to go any further in that direction. We’re not going to do that. Could we have stopped before the atomic bomb was developed and said: Actually, we know where that knowledge will lead us, so we won’t develop that thing?\n\nCould we stop now? This is a big crunch point. Huge numbers of people are warning against the further development of A.I. systems, including, most disturbingly, many of the people creating them. They’re the ones who are warning most loudly about where the systems will take us. Geoffrey Hinton, the British so-called godfather of A.I., in an interview, he thinks there’s probably a 20 percent chance that the development of A.I. will lead to total human extinction. So he’s the guy who created it. It’s not just weirdos like me on podcasts.\n\nDouthat: No, that perspective has been aired on this very podcast.\n\nKingsnorth: This is not unusual. So the people creating these things are saying: We have to stop doing it. So our question now, as human beings, is: Are we foresighted enough to be able to say: No, we’re not going to go that way. We’re going to go this way instead. I don’t know. Because so much of this is driven by profit and so much of it is just driven by the kind of telos of the people creating these things who seem to be taking us in a human direction.\n\nDouthat: But it’s also driven by some of the actual experiences of technological progress that people feel have been gifts for pretty obvious reasons, having to do with health, well-being and survival, before they get to the phase of welcoming the iPhone into their home.\n\nKingsnorth: I agree.\n\nDouthat: What is the healthy stage of our society or any society’s relationship to toolmaking, tech, invention? Is there a period in time where you would say, OK, that society is getting it right, that then slips away as the machine takes over?\n\nKingsnorth: That’s a very good question. The case I’m trying to make here is not that you point to a particular stage in the past and say, well, that was all wonderful, let’s go back there. And you’re right. It can’t be done anyway, so it doesn’t matter. But it’s also not the point, and there’s no doubt at all that, as you say, at the most basic level, there have been obviously great improvements in people’s lives, including in the house I live in, which would not have been the same place 100 years ago.\n\nThat is ultimately the question. Is there a point at which you can say things were working here and we shouldn’t have gone any further?\n\nDouthat: Not even that you shouldn’t have gone any further, but a cultural mode where you say this society is inventing things and relating to them in a way that is good, where you can trust them with the power of invention. At one point you cite Oswald Spengler, the great doom-ridden German philosopher of the 1910s and 1920s, and he has sa vision of history where societies have healthy cultures that give way to decadent, machinelike civilizations, and then fall and the cycle starts again. What was the healthy culture of the Western world?\n\nKingsnorth: So here’s the thing. Everything’s an exchange. There is no point at which you have a healthy culture that does not have negatives to it.\n\nThe question maybe is what the exchange is. So today we have, if we’re lucky enough to be middle-class people in the Western world and not people in Africa digging up the cobalt for the phones we’re having to use every day, which is always worth emphasizing. All of this stuff comes with a huge cost, not just an environmental cost. Much of the stuff we’re actually buying in a city is literally manufactured by slaves in factories somewhere in the east or in Africa, who we don’t have to see.\n\nThere’s always an exchange. So we have a certain level of comfort, which most of us don’t want to give up, but there’s a price to pay for that. The same thing would be true of, I don’t know, living in a situation 100 years ago where people were living more simply, perhaps living, living a materially poorer existence.\n\nThe exchange they would be making is in some cases, at least, they would have a stronger community. They would have a closer relationship to nature. They would have a clearer religion, they would have a simpler life, but the exchange they would be making is they would be less materially rich. Let me answer it the way I try to answer it in the book —\n\nDouthat: [Laughs.] It’s OK to say the high Middle Ages got some things right without saying we want to go back to the 13th century and so on, but it’s OK to say it.\n\nKingsnorth: If we’re talking about the West, if I were to look at, say, England, I would be looking at premodern England and I would say, OK, in premodern England to a great degree, despite all the general problems that you have in people’s everyday lives, you have a situation in which people have a strong religious organization, they have a source of meaning.\n\nThey’re a Christian society, they have a sense of direction, they have real communities and they have a sense of who they are and they have a relationship to nature. So, again, as I say in the book, I try to define what actually makes a real culture and I come up with this formulation that I call the four P’s, which are people, place, prayer and the past.\n\nI think those are the four legs on which the stool of a real culture is built on. So you have people, that’s your community. You have place, that’s the place you live in, the place you come from, the relationship you have to the natural world. Then you have prayer, that’s your relationship with God, and you have the past, which is where you and your stories come from, which you want to pass on to your children.\n\nIf I were to look at England I would say, even before the Industrial Revolution, all those things were virtually intact, despite all the various problems you might have in your everyday life. In the book, I try to identify where the machine begins. I look at the way that people’s land was taken away from them. They were forced into the cities. Capitalism begins to develop.\n\nDouthat: This is … 1600s?\n\nKingsnorth: This is really from the 1500s to 1600s onward. By the 1900s it’s very well developed and the English ruling class can then take that model out into the world, out into the colonies and impose it on everyone else.\n\nSo you enclose people’s land, you enclose their lives, you make them powerless. So anytime before that is a time which, despite all the problems you have, and we all know about them, you have a sense of living in a real culture in a real place. It’s interesting, if I talk to my elderly neighbors in Ireland about what life used to be like there, they’ll readily concede that it was poorer and they like not being so poor. But also, almost instantly, they will talk about the complete collapse of community in the place that they live in. The fact that they knew all the neighbors and now they don’t know anybody.\n\nNobody goes visiting anyone’s houses anymore. The abundance of nature has been destroyed by mechanized farming. The folk traditions have gone. Nobody goes to the church anymore. So on the one hand say, well, look, they’re warmer and better off than they were before, and they’ve got a wider variety of food, but they’ve lost a huge number of the things that actually make being human meaningful.\n\nI think it’s very easy to look at that and say, well, that’s just romanticizing the past because the things that make human life meaningful are not as easily measured.\n\nWe can have statistics on poverty relief, and we can have statistics on how much economic growth has been and how much more G.D.P. we have and how we’ve all got a house full of televisions and iPhones and cars that we didn’t have 50 years ago, and therefore we’re wealthier. But culturally and spiritually, we’re not wealthier. In most cases, there’s been a huge decline, so that’s the exchange.\n\nDouthat: I guess I’m interested in that idea of exchange, an idea of balance. I think about this in terms of America, because obviously America,  we were born in the machine in some ways. The period you’re describing is the period when America began. We’ve always been a technological republic. There’s no medieval past for Americans to look back on. We have to live in a world where we’re trying to find balance. Right?\n\nKingsnorth: Does America want balance, though? [Laughs.] Does America always move forward? I think America always moves forward. It’s a modern society. It’s an enlightenment culture. To go back to Spengler or someone like the British historian Arnold Toynbee who’s writing at a similar period in time, they posit this cyclical nature of civilizations. There’s always a rise and fall.\n\nI’m quite convinced by that model. I think that’s whether or not it has a mathematical basis, that’s what societies tend to do. So I’m not sure that humans are actually capable of getting to the point where they say: OK, we’ve got a good balance here.\n\nCan you have a balance of a really rooted culture with a relationship to nature and God that also has iPhones in his pocket? That’s the question.\n\nDouthat: That is the concrete question right now. The general question, though, is if you accept a cyclical story and you wake up and you realize: Not only am I in the middle of my life, but I’m in the middle of the phase in civilizational history when things are going bad.\n\nIs it just all over? Are you just sitting around waiting for the fall? Or can you — this is something I think about a lot. The United States of America, we are a capitalist liberal society. We’re also a society that has its own internal arcs of religiosity. We have great awakenings, we have revivals, we have fall secularization, then we get another revival and so on. Can you look at 21st-century America and say: We seem to be in this decadent phase, but maybe we can have religious revival, or if you’re not religious, civic revival? Can we avoid the collapse?\n\nKingsnorth: Well, I actually think those two things are quite closely related. So I’m a member of the Orthodox Church. I know a lot of Orthodox people in America. I’ve just been to a monastery in upstate New York. There’s a huge revival in an interest in Orthodox Christianity here, especially among young men. Interestingly, huge numbers of young men coming into the church. Same is true in parts of the Catholic Church. Same is true where I live in Ireland. And in England, there’s a very clear evidence of a very significant uptick — in Christianity, which would never have been predicted five or six years ago.\n\nI mean, Christianity in particular is a religion which actually flourishes best when things are collapsing. In my opinion, I think Christianity does worse when it is powerful and comfortable. It’s a society, it’s a religion which grew out of a collapse. The early Christians had to live through the collapse of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Irish monks and the monks in other parts of places like England, who kept the Christian faith going and kept the books hidden and took them out into the culture after the barbarian invasions, they built Christendom. Christianity works and comes and flourishes at a time of collapse.\n\nA lot of people find the kind of stuff I talk about extremely depressing. I don’t find it depressing. I find it in some ways quite exciting because everyone might have a different analysis of where we are.\n\nTalk to a guy in Silicon Valley; he’ll say everything’s terrific. The singularity’s coming. We’re moving in the right direction. Talk to a doomer like me; I think we’re dehumanizing ourselves and destroying the natural world, but to me, a realization of the fact that we’re in a revolutionary moment gives us a chance to actually say, well, what’s actually true? What’s real?\n\nWhat do we actually want to do? How do we want to build societies? What do we want to do in our own lives? What relationship do we want to have with technology? Should I be going back to church? What do I want to teach my children? It’s at times when things seem to be collapsing or crumbling, when all the new shoots come up, which actually is also another story of America, I think, that happens repeatedly. Things seem to be falling apart and then something grows again. That’s certainly the story of the Christian Church over the last 2,000 years.\n\nDouthat: I completely agree with that. I do wonder, though, in the traditional cycles of the civilization story, what brings things down in the end is barbarian invasion. But in your storytelling about the internet, you use the phrase Faustian to describe the bargain that our civilization has made. Well, Faust, you know, he gets everything he wants, and then he gives up his soul and goes to hell. So let’s just be supernaturalist for a minute. The internet is not the Huns. It’s not the Mongols. But is it the devil?\n\nKingsnorth: Sometimes I think the internet is a giant Ouija board and we use it to summon things. And things appear through it. So if you want to be supernaturalist about it, if you want to be Christian about it, the world is inhabited by powers and principalities and demonic forces, which have it in for us, and which want to turn us away from God. That’s their purpose. I think if C.S. Lewis was writing “The Screwtape Letters” today, there would be a good few letters about how the demons can use the internet, how they can use the phones, how they can use this to completely delude us and distract us and take us away from our true purpose.\n\nThere’s a couple of chapters in the book in which I speculate quite openly about this, and I’ve done it in other parts of my writing, especially in fiction as well, because I think there’s something very spiritually dark about the internet, actually. Just on a practical level, we see chatbots persuading teenagers to kill themselves. We have all sorts of dark, horrible stuff going on. But there’s something about the very deliberate drive to ask our Silicon Valley overlords, say, to create God, to make God. I mean, the book is full of quotes from these people about what they’re doing, and it’s openly theological.\n\nWe’re creating God, we’re building God, we’re replacing God. We’re creating machines that will have a spirituality to them. That’s where we’re going. So we have a sense that what we’re doing with the internet is not simply using a bunch of ones and zeros to give us a load of stuff we want, but actually creating a new religion, a new spiritual worldview in which we are going to upload our minds. We are going to live forever.\n\nAnd in the process of trying to create an artificial intelligence, the question that haunts me is: Are we creating these things or are we summoning them?\n\nIs it possible that the machines we’ve made are actually being inhabited by something else? Is this just a mess we’ve made with our technology? Or is there something that’s actually working on our minds through it, which occasionally can keep you up at night.\n\nDouthat: We had Peter Thiel on this podcast — entrepreneur, technologist, religious believer of a distinctive kind — and we talked about the Antichrist. Thiel’s argument is that the Antichrist is likely to deliver peace and safety and promise to freeze everything in place and just protect people. The Antichrist would be, in the end, an enemy of technological progress.\n\nI think it’s safe to say that you have roughly the opposite perspective, and that what you are describing is the Antichrist coming in the form of a technological solution to all of human nature?\n\nKingsnorth: I think Peter Thiel’s trying to get us to look in the wrong direction — probably quite deliberately. Peter Thiel only came out a few days ago and said that he thought that regulating A.I. would lead to the rise of Antichrist precisely for that reason.\n\nIs Antichrist going to be a person or is Antichrist going to be a machine? Is Antichrist going to be a being that we create or that comes through the things that we have created?\n\nI think people like Peter Thiel are involved in building something which is becoming quite openly evil — destructive of human flourishing, destructive of nature, destructive of our relationships, destructive in all the ways that we’ve talked about.\n\nI think it’s fascinating that these billionaires who are involved in creating weapons systems and surveillance technology are also talking from a Christian perspective. I find that utterly bizarre.\n\nThe constant progress of the technological system at the moment — the direction it’s going in — is going to lead to the rise of beings which are very Antichrist-like in their functioning. The promise of Antichrist in the Christian story is that he — or it — is a great prophet, which imitates Christ. Every religious believer thinks this is the new prophet who has come to unite a world which is crumbling.\n\nThat’s the promise that technology’s giving us at the moment. That’s the promise that we are being openly given by the people who are creating these great superhuman intelligences, these great beyond-human minds that they’re trying to build. These things are going to bring us together. These things are going to solve our problem. These things will be rational. These things will overcome our human passions and our destruction. These things will unite us.\n\nIt’s almost as if the technological system is coalescing — the Silicon Valley people talk openly about this — toward the creation of a being, which is seen to be and is promised to be our salvation. And when they start to talk about uploading their minds into the silicon substrate, you’ve effectively got a digital Christian heresy going on.\n\nYou’ve got Christianity without Christ: We create heaven. We create a place in which we can live eternal lives, and we ultimately create beings which we regard as gods.\n\nDouthat: Some of the people in Silicon Valley — Thiel included — have for a long time complained that technological progress has focused so exclusively on the digital, on the virtual.\n\nThiel’s famous line was we were promised flying cars and we got Twitter. And obviously, Elon Musk wants to build rockets to get into space. Jeff Bezos wants to do the same thing.\n\nI see a distinction between technological impulses. I think that building rockets to go into space is OK. Not only is it OK, it might even be good. It might be the human destiny. Whereas I completely agree with everything you are saying about the ambition of uploading our minds to the cloud.\n\nI want to root for certain kinds of technological progress and against others. But am I not allowed to do that? If I like Elon Musk’s rockets, am I hastening the uploading of my consciousness into some kind of hell, effectively?\n\nKingsnorth: Well, that’s a good question, isn’t it? I’m not with you on the rockets. I think we should stay here ——\n\nDouthat: Yeah, you’re very anti-space.\n\nKingsnorth: We should stay here because there’s something about boys with toys here. There’s something about these guys — isn’t it so cool? We can go into space. We’re going to terraform Mars, we’re going to mine the asteroids. But they haven’t changed the mind-set that’s actually been so destructive here.\n\nSo what are we going to do? We’re going to go and terraform Mars. We’re going to live there. Create a new planet to live on because we’ve wrecked this one, and I’m sure we’re not going to end up doing exactly the same thing.\n\nInstead of going on an outer journey all the time — which is what our culture’s so good at — maybe we should try and go on an inner journey. Because the thing that we have utterly destroyed in Western culture — including much of Western Christianity, which is one of the reasons I’m an Orthodox Christian — is the contemplative life, the inner search, the inner journey. And usually those two things balance out.\n\nAnd I was thinking only yesterday, actually, about this: that maybe a society which can balance its outer exploration with its inner exploration could be a more healthy one. We’ve effectively abolished inner exploration — except in a very New Agey, very individualistic way where we define our own reality.\n\nI think that’s the same impulse that leads someone like Elon Musk to want to put a chip in your brain. So he doesn’t want to go to Mars, but he also wants to put a chip in your brain ——\n\nDouthat: Yes, he does.\n\nKingsnorth: And it leads someone like Peter Thiel to create Palantir, which can survey all of human life from a very low level and then hand that information all over to the military. It’s the same impulse.\n\nAre we trying to live a life that serves God and serves the creation of God and serves human flourishing on that basis? Or are we trying to serve ourselves and our own desire to explore and create and get rich?\n\nDouthat: Sure, but part of our desire to explore and create is God-given and good.\n\nKingsnorth: Maybe. What’s God-given and good? I mean, everything’s God-given, but is it all good? No. So then you have to distinguish between the good God-given things and the bad ones.\n\nDouthat: Elon Musk converts to Orthodox Christianity, disappears into a monastery for 10 years, re-emerges ——\n\nKingsnorth: I thought that was a new story for a minute. [Laughs.]\n\nDouthat: At the moment, I would say Musk is interested in affiliating himself with Christianity on X, which is some degree short of actual conversion.\n\nPut yourself in God’s perspective for a moment, hubristically. Is there a world where human beings could be worthy of going to space? Maybe God won’t let us succeed until we have a kind of cultural conversion.\n\nKingsnorth: Well, the question is what Musk wants to do when he comes out of the monastery. He’s not going to want to do the same thing, is he?\n\nDouthat: I don’t expect you’ll trust it if he comes out of the monastery and says: We’re still going to Mars ——\n\nKingsnorth: I was right about everything. [Laughs.]\n\nLook, I don’t know the answer to that. Who knows what God’s purpose is for us? But I see something intensely sacrilegious and self-centered and anti-nature and anti-culture in the direction that we’re going in at the moment. We’re a society which believes all limits exist to be broken — culturally, socially, ecologically, technologically.\n\nIf we see a limit, we just break it. We don’t have any sense that there is anything that holds us together. If we don’t rediscover that, then it’s going to be boys with toys all the way down. And some of the toys the boys will build might be fun and useful, and many of them will be massively destructive.\n\nI think that because we have the same rootless, limitless vision of progress, those two things go together. That’s the way I see it at the moment.\n\nDouthat: But maybe you trust the culture of the high Middle Ages with vaccines and rocket ships — or maybe just the vaccines.\n\nKingsnorth: That’s kind of like a steampunk novel that maybe I need to write next.\n\nDouthat: Let’s end with a novel that you have written called “Alexandria,” which came out in 2020.\n\nKingsnorth: Yes, right in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nDouthat: I’ve been sort of pushing you to define the apocalypse.\n\nThat’s a novel about an apocalypse. It’s set around the year 3000 A.D., a thousand years in the future. And it’s a world where both strands of your dark vision have come to pass.\n\nThere’s been ecological catastrophe of some kind. And, in part to escape the ecological catastrophe, human beings have made a deal with an A.I. mind that they think they’ve created, but maybe they’ve summoned. And everybody’s uploaded their minds to this virtual city called Alexandria that may or may not be paradise. Except there’s a really small number of people who have chosen not to and who live a deeply premodern existence on the fringes of what used to be the British Isles. And the story is mostly about them.\n\nI found this book very depressing. But not only because I found that choice depressing. I want to stipulate for the record: I will never upload my mind to the cloud; I will refuse Alexandria no matter what terms are offered. But I’m not going to live a premodern life.\n\nThe premodern life depicted in the book is authentically premodern, and therefore, to my mind, deeply unattractive and indeed terrifying. There are billions and billions of people on planet Earth living in the machine as you describe it.\n\nEight billion people are not going to move to County Galway, and if they did, it would be terrible. So what do they do?\n\nKingsnorth: Absolutely. Don’t do that. One of the poems I start the book with is by Robinson Jeffers, great Californian poet.\n\nDouthat: Very dark poet, I have to say. Very dark poet. Not an optimist.\n\nKingsnorth: Not an optimist, but he has this poem about a purse seine fishing net closing around a group of fish that he’s watching from a cliff in California.\n\nAnd he sees that as a kind of story for where we are in the culture. What I’m trying to do with “Alexandria” is to play out this debate and take it to its extremes and say: What would actually happen if you had this choice? And what would be the upsides and the downsides, the dark sides and the light sides of both of those choices?\n\nI’m trying to play out a debate there. As you say, most of the world is living in cities now. We’re all in the technological system. Even if we live out in County Galway, we’re still on the internet. That’s how it works.\n\nDouthat: Sometimes they even make you go on book tour.\n\nKingsnorth: Sometimes they even make you go on book tours, on planes.\n\nThere’s no way of escaping it. I know people who live in off-grid cabins with no running water and no electricity. They still haven’t escaped the machine. They still have to have a bank account.\n\nSo asking yourself if you can step outside the system is almost the wrong question. The question is what relationship you can have with it and where you can draw your lines. What do you want to do with technology, and what do you want it to do with you?\n\nI think if you don’t define your relationship with the machine, it defines it for you. And that’s true of all of us. We can be different degrees inside and outside the system, maybe, depending on where we are. There are levels of relationship, but it’s a time when we’re all caught up in this thing. It’s been building up for a long time.\n\nI don’t know where it’s going, but I do know that it’s worth asking who our technology serves and what relationship we want to have with the system. Then at least we’ve got some kind of chance of living a human life at a time when I think there’s going to be more pressure on the simple reality of actually being human than there’s ever been before.\n\nDouthat: On that theme, the last question is similar to one I actually asked Peter Thiel. In the end, God will not abandon us to the machine, right?\n\nKingsnorth: Without wanting to spoil the end of the book, the end of the book is not depressing. Not to me. The end of the book is actually very much the opposite of depressing. Something quite transcendent happens.\n\nIf you’re a Christian, you know what happens at the end, anyway. Christ has already overcome the world, so we have to be of good cheer throughout the age of the machine.\n\nMy favorite line in the whole Bible: “Be of good cheer for I’ve overcome the world.”\n\nSo what we have to do as we live in this world at this particular time of challenge — and history has given Christians and others plenty of times of challenge and horror and difficulty — is try to live our faith through it and try to remain human through it.\n\nOne of the many differences, I’m sure, between me and Peter Thiel is we probably have a very different idea of what it means to be human and what God actually means by that. And what our relationship to nature and culture should be.\n\nWe’re living in a time in which our traditional notions of humanity have been challenged more than ever. That’s very difficult, but it’s also an opportunity to actually look at what we think is true, what we think is good, what we think is real, what we think it means to be human, what we think a good human society looks like.\n\nIn the end, if you’re a Christian, you know what the end of the story is. But in the meantime, I think that standing up against this progressive, spiritual dehumanization — which is what technology is giving us at the moment — is quite imperative.\n\nYou’ve got your lines, you’re not going to upload your mind.\n\nDouthat: I’m pretty committed.\n\nKingsnorth: I think that’s good. This is the place we’re going to be at in a few years if we’re not there already: asking ourselves what our lines are and what we are as human beings. And that gives us an opportunity to ask ourselves what it actually means to be human. Which is maybe a question we’ve never been asked before in this context, but we have to ask it now.\n\nDouthat: Paul Kingsnorth, thanks for joining me.\n\nKingsnorth: Thank you.\n\nThoughts?

Kyiv as It Torments Ukrainian Civilians\n\nPublished: 2025-11-14T09:30:51-05:00\n\nRussian missiles and drones pounded Kyiv overnight in an attack that killed six people and sparked fires in buildings across the city, the local authorities said. It was the latest in a series of Russian aerial assaults that have often targeted the country’s power grid in an effort to plunge Ukrainians into cold and darkness as winter looms.\n\nThe attack also targeted Kharkiv in the northeast, limiting electricity and disrupting water supplies. But the main focus appeared to be Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, where air-raid sirens first wailed shortly before midnight to signal the start of the attack and sounded again at 5 a.m. to mark its end.\n\nBetween those alerts, residents heard a grimly familiar soundtrack — the buzz of attack drones over neighborhoods, the staccato of heavy machine guns trying to shoot them down and the thud of air-defense missiles trying to intercept Russian ones.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched 19 missiles and 430 drones, most of which were shot down. These figures could not be independently verified.\n\n“This was a deliberately calculated attack aimed at causing maximum harm to people and civilian infrastructure,” President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media. “In Kyiv alone, dozens of apartment buildings have been damaged.” He added that missile debris had hit the Azerbaijani Embassy.\n\nMr. Zelensky said, “Ukraine is responding to these strikes with long-range strength,” a reference to Kyiv’s campaign of long-range strikes on Russia’s oil infrastructure, aimed at cutting off the energy revenues that fuel the Kremlin’s war effort.\n\nThe Russian authorities in the southwestern region of Krasnodar reported an attack on the Russian Black Sea port city of Novorossiysk, where drones damaged an oil depot, a cargo container terminal and coastal facilities.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have widened their long-range strike campaign to include Russia’s own power grid, hitting several substations and thermal plants and causing temporary blackouts. Targeting of the power grid appears aimed at bringing the war directly to Russian civilians while also signaling that Ukraine can respond in kind to Russia’s attacks.\n\nStill, Russia retains the upper hand in the aerial war. Last month alone, it launched more than 5,500 attack drones and decoys at Ukraine, forcing the country to defend its skies nearly every night. It also fired nearly 270 missiles, more than in any month since early 2024, according to a New York Times analysis of data published by the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nMr. Zelensky has long urged Ukraine’s Western allies to supply more air defenses. He said he wanted to order Patriot air-defense systems from the United States, each of which costs at least $1 billion to build. Kyiv, already cash-strapped by nearly four years of war, has no choice but to press its European partners to foot the bill. Mr. Zelensky is scheduled to visit Greece and France on Sunday and Monday.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:24:51.089+00:00","title":"Sudan conflict: Mass killings investigation gets green light from UN","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN Human Rights Council has approved a new independent investigation into mass killings in El-Fasher, Sudan, following a two-year civil war that has killed over 150,000 and displaced 12 million.

backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher.\n\n\"Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,\" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday.\n\nSince the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes.\n\nThe new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher.\n\nThe findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court.\n\nWhile Türk did warn individuals and companies  \"fuelling and profiting\" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict.\n\nThe UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army.\n\nPlus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry.\n\nEl-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies.\n\nThe RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied.\n\nOne gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\"The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,\" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades.\n\nThe scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed.\n\nBack then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\"[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,\" she said.\n\nA joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\".\n\nIt follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations.\n\nThe US is one of the so-called \"Quad\" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule.\n\nRubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: \"We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved.\"\n\nThe UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by \"the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher\" and accused the Sudanese army of \"starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons\". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected.\n\nA furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called \"all biased statements against them\" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce.\n\nThe RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal.\n\nIn the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting.\n\nOnly a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth  are visible from space in satellite imagery .\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Türk said: \"There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action\" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war.\n\n\"It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.\"\n\nThe flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts.\n\nAmnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan.\n\nThe smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur -  according to a leaked report by UN experts .\n\nThe UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF \"isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it\".\n\nHe also said he did not want to \"diminish\" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying \"that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side\", meaning to the Sudanese army.\n\nAll parties deny these allegations.\n\nA fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities.\n\nIn response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\"\n\nThere has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Bateman\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/politics/trump-affordability-economy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:54:01-05:00","title":"Trump Turns to Affordability Message Amid Economic Frustration","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is shifting its economic messaging and policy direction in response to widespread public frustration over high prices and economic stagnation.

A 50-year mortgage to reduce monthly home payments. Direct checks of $2,000 to many Americans. And a new willingness to welcome skilled foreign labor into the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun floating a series of ideas over the past several weeks as it confronts the cold reality that its economic policies are not helping many Americans who continue to struggle with elevated prices and a sense of economic pessimism.\n\nLast week’s elections made clear that affordability was top of mind for many Americans. Voters in New York propelled Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist with an ambitious agenda to lower the cost of living, to victory in the mayoral race. Democratic wins in New Jersey and Virginia were built on promises to address the high cost of living in those states.\n\nOnly 30 percent of voters believe President Trump has lived up to their expectations for tackling inflation and the cost of living, according to a recent NBC News poll. That was his lowest mark for any issue respondents were asked about. And a meager 27 percent of voters in a CNN poll in late October said Mr. Trump’s policies had improved the country’s economic conditions — less than half of those who thought he had made matters worse.\n\nIn the wake of those results, the administration has begun rolling out new policies and recasting its economic messaging to try to show they are serious about combating the nation’s affordability crisis.\n\nThat includes a watering-down of some policies, such as tariffs, that the Trump administration insisted for months were not causing prices to rise for American consumers. The president is also planning to travel around the country to try to explain more clearly how his policies are helping Americans.\n\n“We understand that people understand, as people look at their pocketbooks to go to the grocery store, that there’s still work to do,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said outside the White House on Thursday. He said that providing consumers with more purchasing power is “something that we’re going to fix, and we’re going to fix it right away.”\n\nThe new urgency over affordability comes ahead of looming midterm elections that could alter the course of Mr. Trump’s presidency if Democrats retake control of one or both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe Trump administration contends that its policies have curbed inflation and boosted wages. However, the sticker shock from tariffs combined with high mortgage rates that have made homes more expensive have made consumers generally skittish. A survey of consumer sentiment published by the University of Michigan last month showed growing gloominess about personal finances and business conditions.\n\nThis week, Mr. Trump said that he “doesn’t want to hear about affordability” because the U.S. economy is so strong.\n\nBut in an acknowledgment that Americans are frustrated with high food prices, he said in an interview with Fox News that aired this week that he expected to lower tariffs on coffee and fruit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed on Wednesday that relief would be coming in the form of “substantial announcements” that would lower prices for food that the United States does not widely produce.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration noted that Mr. Trump appeared to be solving a problem that he had created through his policies.\n\n“They have pursued an anti-affordability agenda for their time in office,” said Bharat Ramamurti, a deputy director of the National Economic Council in the Biden administration, who pointed to Mr. Trump’s policies on tariffs and immigration restrictions. “If they reverse some of that, maybe costs will come down.”\n\nWage increases have been outpacing inflation in the United States this year, but not significantly enough for people to feel like they are better off. And a protracted government shutdown sowed panic among lower-income Americans whose food stamps became a political pawn in the standoff. Food banks across the United States reported a surge in customers, with local and national media outlets showing long lines of people waiting for groceries to feed their families.\n\nIn emphasizing affordability, the White House is grappling with the fact that its policies cannot please everyone. Last month, Mr. Trump suggested that the United States would begin importing more beef from Argentina in an attempt to bring down prices. That led to swift backlash from American cattle ranchers who said that such a move would undercut their profits.\n\nSome Republicans expressed disappointment this week after Mr. Trump told Laura Ingraham of Fox News that he would support allowing more skilled foreign labor into the United States to train Americans to make high-tech products at new factories.\n\nWhite House officials have also struggled to explain how they can claim that tariffs are not imposing additional costs on consumers but that removing or lowering them will lower costs.\n\nThe Trump administration is preparing to issue broad exemptions to certain tariffs to ease food prices, according to people briefed on the plans. The exemptions are expected to apply to the global tariffs Mr. Trump announced in April, including on products coming from countries that have not yet struck trade deals with the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration is promoting affordability on several other fronts. In a speech in New York this week, Mr. Bessent argued that curtailing federal spending was helping to keep borrowing costs lower for bank loans and home mortgages.\n\n“Maintaining a robust Treasury market — and strengthening it even further — is essential to making America affordable again,” Mr. Bessent said. “The work we do here directly impacts affordability and quality of life out there.”\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Bessent have also been pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates support the housing market. The Treasury secretary said last week that some sectors of the economy were already in a recession as he called on the central bank to cut rates more quickly.\n\nWith the housing market weighing heavily on the economy, Mr. Trump and his aides have been contemplating more creative ideas to lower monthly home expenses.\n\nThe president this week suggested that he was considering an expansion of the traditional 30-year mortgage to allow borrowers to take out home loans that could be repaid over 50 years. However, the idea was criticized because it would saddle consumers with more debt and interest costs.\n\nWilliam Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said this week that his agency was “actively evaluating portable mortgages,” which would allow mortgage holders to purchase new homes at their existing interest rates. Although loans of shorter durations in other countries are portable, such a policy could be complicated in the United States because of the way home loans are bundled and sold as investments.\n\nThe White House is also focusing on ways to make Americans feel wealthier. Mr. Trump has pitched offering $2,000 checks to Americans that would be funded by tariff revenue — if Congress approved such a plan — and Mr. Bessent predicted this week that taxpayers would start to see benefits early next year from the tax cuts that Republicans passed over the summer.\n\nBut most of the policies that Mr. Trump’s team is considering would require cooperation from Congress or a broad reversal of his trade agenda. Analysts are skeptical that minor adjustments to his economic plan will have a meaningful impact on affordability.\n\n“The Trump administration’s plans to lower tariffs on some high-profile consumer goods are important symbolic steps to address the affordability issue that voters are frustrated by,” said Owen Tedford, an analyst at Beacon Policy Advisers. “Still, it is uncertain how much they will actually affect voters’ pocketbooks and satisfy their desire for the president to do more about high prices.”\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration appears poised to continue its strategy of blaming the problems in the economy on the policies of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n“Cleaning up Joe Biden’s inflation and economic disaster has been a top focus for President Trump since Day 1, when he signed an array of executive orders to unleash American energy and slash costly regulations,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman. “The Trump administration will continue to implement and emphasize these and other economic policies that are cutting costs, raising real wages, and securing trillions in investments to make and hire in America.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/world/asia/asian-immigrants-burglaries.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:01:38-05:00","title":"While Asian Immigrants Work, Burglars Target Their Homes","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent burglary in Eugene, Oregon, involving Chong Man Kim and his wife Byung Sook, has drawn attention to a growing wave of crimes targeting Asian households across the United States.

She loved the politician, even though she was a political reporter and he was then a presidential candidate she had written about. She loved his eyes, “blue as the flame.” She loved that “the sight of something as trivial as a rose” could move him to tears. She loved his insatiable appetites and his “particular complications and particular darkness.”\n\nBut she said “I love you” only after he said it first. He called her “Livvy” and wrote her poems. He said he wanted her to have his baby. He promised to take a bullet for her.\n\nThis is what Nuzzi writes in her memoir, “American Canto,” never naming the politician who readers will deduce is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nAt the height of the 2024 presidential campaign, Nuzzi seemed to have a digital affair with Kennedy centered around texts and phone calls. The revelation derailed her career, led to her firing at New York magazine, and precipitated a very public explosion of her relationship with another prominent political journalist. Kennedy tried to brush her off, saying he had met her just once for the “hit piece” she wrote and threw his support behind Donald J. Trump, eventually becoming a cabinet secretary in his administration.\n\nNuzzi disappeared for a year, in self-imposed exile in Los Angeles where she wrote “American Canto” in secret. The book, which comes out Dec. 2 and is described here for the first time, paints a picture of a nation and a personal life on fire. She describes the mutual infatuation that consumed her, even if it was never consummated. (She is ambiguous in the book, but said in one of many interviews, “We were not sleeping together.”) But “American Canto” is far more about bearing witness to Trumpworld and about how she believes that warped her, just as it warped the country.\n\nYou could argue that referring to Kennedy and other players in the book by monikers like “the politician” is literary. It also allows her to construct a world where everyone is a sketch and proof is beside the point. Nuzzi makes clear in the book that she realizes there are people who will disagree with her version of events. She does not try to prove them. When I asked, for example, whether the text messages with Kennedy still exist, she said, “I don’t have anything to say about that.”\n\nKennedy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSitting under a pine tree in Los Angeles one night last month, Nuzzi gave up the pretense of trying to explain the unexplainable and reached for a joke for the people who simply could not fathom what came over her.\n\n“Maybe it was the vaccines.”\n\nNuzzi, 32, lives in a tiny house in the heart of Malibu where lizards crawl into her kitchen and the King James Bible and “The Divine Comedy” — two books she was reading while she was writing “American Canto” — sit on her dining room table. She drives around in a white Mustang convertible, like a Lana Del Rey song come to life.\n\nShe fled to the West Coast a year ago when the nation seemed to be “up my skirt,” as she puts it, aided by paparazzi who were determined to keep her in the news. Here she can hike in peace, though she feels hunted. Drones fly overhead; she wonders if it’s merely a coincidence.\n\nOver a decade, Nuzzi cared less about breaking news than about exposing the foibles and vanity of Trump and the people within his orbit. The president sat down with her repeatedly, despite the fact that she often did not exactly make him look good.\n\nIn the book, she describes Trump as a monster who “succeeded by making even those who said they loathed him behave sometimes quite like him.”\n\nWhy was he so willing to keep talking to her?\n\n“I certainly don’t think he’s a careful reader,” she said, sucking on a vape stick as she drove toward her “favorite rock,” off the Pacific Coast Highway. “There’s a clip once where I said something to the effect of: He loves attention, women and magazines. In that order.”\n\nNuzzi tried to convey that this comment was a joke, but she cannot entirely discount the possibility that being a woman and looking like the modern iteration of a Hitchcock blonde contributed to the access she got.\n\nShe steered the Mustang onto a patch of dirt on the side of the road and put on a black leather jacket that she pulled from the back seat. The rock she loved was at the edge of a vertiginous cliff, where water rolled and crashed.\n\n“Don’t get closer than that,” she warned, as I tried to peer over.\n\nThroughout the book, she writes of precipices, both real and metaphorical. Trump, at the top of the escalator; the distortions at the edge of a black hole; the moment before sleep when you realize you’re falling in love; the moment you’re sitting before your boss about to be confronted with “the rumors.”\n\nWhich, of course, were true.\n\nThe book — most of which she punched into her phone while hiking — is not exactly a memoir, though much of it is about her decade in journalism before she met Kennedy and her early years growing up on the Neversink River in New Jersey. Her father was a union man with the Department of Sanitation and her mother was a former catalog model who drank way too much and had what Nuzzi describes in the book as a “borderline personality gaze.”\n\nLike Trump, Nuzzi attended Fordham University. He transferred to Wharton, the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. She got an internship with Anthony Weiner’s 2013 campaign for mayor. She then wrote a piece about what a mess it was and took it to The Daily News. When the story was published, Weiner’s spokeswoman, Barbara Morgan, dismissed her to other press outlets as a “slutbag.” They are now close friends.\n\nTwo years later, at 22, she was writing full time for The Daily Beast about Trump, hitting Trump Tower during the day and reading Jimmy Breslin at night — a crash course in the school of journalism where a writer doubles as star witness. She parlayed that effort into a job at New York magazine, becoming at 24 its Washington correspondent, the first time in the magazine’s 50-year history anyone held such a post.\n\nHer pieces were filled with absurd details. In 2019, she described Rudy Giuliani showing up to an early afternoon interview with his fly unzipped and drinking Bloody Marys. In 2021, she quoted the Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and his wife talking about her after they failed to realize that they hadn’t ended their phone conversation. “We’ve got to go lock our door,” he says, seemingly fearful that Nuzzi was going to break into his campaign headquarters.\n\nAnd in 2024, just days after President Biden gave a career-ending performance at a CNN presidential debate with Trump, Nuzzi published a piece presenting the silence around Biden’s increasing frailty as a kind of “Weekend at Bernie’s”-style cover-up with national ramifications. He was so “not there,” she wrote, that “a sex scandal might help him right now.”\n\nCertain quarters of the Democratic Party were furious. A number of New York magazine’s staff members were too. They wondered if she’d gone MAGA on them. But according to Kara Swisher, whose podcast “Pivot” appears on Vox Media, New York’s parent company: “Everything she said about Biden was true. Her writing was over and beyond the best political reporting out there.”\n\n“A politician’s greatest trick is to convince you that he is not one,” Nuzzi writes in her book. “And what is a politician? Any man who wants to be loved more than other men and through his pursuit reveals why he cannot love himself.”\n\nNuzzi says in the book that her romantic entanglement — if one can refer to a digital relationship that way — with “the politician” began after she wrote about him, in an article published in November 2023.\n\nAt the time, she was engaged to the political writer Ryan Lizza. A Quinnipiac University poll had Kennedy, who was running as an Independent candidate, polling around 20 percent in a three-way hypothetical election matchup against Trump and Biden. She described riding with him around Los Angeles in his stinky mess of a van, as he drove recklessly on the road and yelled at his dogs.\n\nShe writes that the first few times Kennedy said he loved her, she did not say it back. Yet she knew she felt the same. “I love him, I thought. Oh no. I love him so much.” They spoke often and were intimate enough for her to see him flossing his teeth, his dopp kit overflowing with prescriptions.\n\nShe writes that despite being “sober” for decades, Kennedy told her that he still uses psychedelics, and even smoked dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a powerful drug on which people are known to have what feel like near-death experiences. She told him she “liked uppers. I told him that I took Adderall.”\n\nThey chose favorite parts of each other, she writes: He chose her mouth. She chose his nose. They shared a “common language, common skepticisms, common ideas about what was beautiful, common beliefs about what was valuable.” She didn’t care that he was 39 years older than her. She liked him just the way he was. They both “moved through the world with amused detachment and deep sensitivity, contradictions that worked somehow in concert.”\n\nShe describes providing him with advice about how to manage campaign issues, including the impending news that Kennedy dropped a bear carcass in Central Park.\n\nAnd when his campaign finally combusted in August 2024 and he sought an alternate path to power, she asked him how he felt visualizing himself onstage endorsing the Democratic candidate. “Nauseous,” he replied.\n\nWhen she then asked him how he would feel about endorsing the Republican candidate, his answer was the same. Yet he had the “hope” he would be able to “negotiate for influence” and the time to do so “was now.”\n\nNuzzi did not want to discuss Kennedy’s tenure as secretary of health and human services. “I don’t have any interest in offering punditry,” she said.\n\nBut in the end, she helped make sure he could get the power he sought. His alleged promise to “take a bullet” for her turned into a request that she take the bullet. She claims in the book that as news broke of their relationship in September 2024, he told her, “If it’s just sex, I can survive it.” She told him she would do whatever he needed her to do.\n\nSitting behind the wheel, shortly after Nancy Sinatra’s version of “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” played on her Spotify, she said the two are no longer in touch. “I haven’t spoken to him in a year,” she said.\n\nHow her relationship to Kennedy became public is not entirely clear, though looking back it seems inevitable, given the worlds they inhabit. Nuzzi blames Lizza, whom she had told while they were still living together.\n\nSwisher, whom Nuzzi describes in the book as a mentor, eventually found out about Kennedy and told senior leadership at New York magazine. “She just needed to come clean and she never did,” Swisher said. “It was a betrayal of the audience.”\n\nNuzzi was fired a month later, in October 2024. That same month, she filed for a protective order against Lizza, claiming that he had hacked into her devices to find damaging information about her as part of a plot to destroy her reputation. Lizza denied all of this, and Nuzzi ultimately dropped the order, saying in her motion to dismiss that Lizza had “successfully exploited the media interest in these proceedings to create an even bigger spectacle.” She still declines to present evidence that he had, in fact, done those things.\n\nIn response to questions, Lizza wrote in a text that Nuzzi had made “false and defamatory allegations” and that she “refused to defend” them.\n\nNuzzi said: “I have forgotten him. I do not wish to remember.” She declined to speak further about Lizza on the record.\n\nNuzzi and Lizza had long owed a book to Avid Reader Press that they were going to write together about the 2020 election. Someone was presumably going to have to pay back the advance they had received from Avid Reader if nothing was written.\n\nBut she says the decision to write “American Canto” was about wanting to “complete a thought” and felt a book would be the right place to do it. “I had a healthy appreciation for the fact that what had happened was not purely a tragedy.”\n\nMeanwhile, with characteristic instincts for the loci of power, she began going to San Vicente Bungalows and the Sunset Tower Hotel. It was there, last July, that she had dinner with Mark Guiducci, Vanity Fair’s new global director of editorial content. They “closed the place down,” he said, talking about the old glamour of magazines and how to reinvent that in the digital era.\n\nSoon enough, he received permission from his corporate higher-ups at Condé Nast to hire her as Vanity Fair’s new West Coast editor. It wasn’t until later that they learned she was about to land back in the news with the publication of “American Canto.”\n\nEarlier this fall, Nuzzi found out that her book was scheduled to come out within days of “Unscripted,” the new memoir from Kennedy’s wife, Cheryl Hines. Avid Reader pushed back the release of “American Canto” by three weeks with the hope that their book tours would not turn into a she said/she said.\n\nAbout the turn her life has taken, Nuzzi said there is no point in expressing wistfulness about what could or should be, rather than what is. But in the book, she describes seeing a flock of drones on Mulholland Highway and feeling “a pang of regret that I could not go out there to report.”\n\nOver the past year, she found herself interviewing strangers, and missed, she said, “relating to the world and everyone in it that way.” She still daydreamed about ways she would cover politics now.\n\nSo last week, as the New York mayoral returns came in and she sat at Mel’s Drive-In in Santa Monica, she was focused on the current mayor.\n\n“Someone has got to be covering Eric Adams tonight,” she said.\n\nWhat better way to memorialize Zohran Mamdani’s win than to capture it through the eyes of the evening’s ultimate loser, its incumbent mayor?\n\nI made a joke about how Adams had seemingly thrown away his life just to fly business class.\n\nNuzzi shrugged.\n\n“I destroyed mine for less,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/palantir-ai-military-stock-market-.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:56:53-05:00","title":"The Most Valuable Military Contractor Doesn’t Make Bombs or Guns","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Palantir, a software and data analytics company founded with support from the CIA, has surpassed traditional defense giants like Lockheed Martin in market value, reaching $490 billion despite having significantly lower revenue.

Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.”\n\nThe S&P 500 defense and aerospace sector contains big publicly traded companies like GE Aerospace, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies). They make the weapons, ammunition and equipment that a nation needs to fight a war: missiles, bombs, tanks, rockets, aircraft, ammunition, ships, radar systems and other tangible things.\n\nThen there’s Palantir. It doesn’t make things. That may be why it’s not included in that august group of military companies. Instead, Palantir is a software and data analysis firm that uses time-honored technologies like data-mining and newer ones like artificial intelligence, for national security purposes. It has benefited tremendously — and, some critics say, exorbitantly — from the A.I. exuberance sweeping through the stock market.\n\nThe numbers are astounding. The market values Palantir at more than $400 billion — a sum that dwarfs those conventional military companies, though they have far greater revenue. For example, in the stock market’s eyes, Lockheed Martin is worth about 75 percent less than Palantir — although Lockheed, a global giant in the manufacturing of aircraft, missiles, helicopters and spacecraft, had about 19 times the revenue of Palantir in their most recent fiscal years, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.\n\nThat Palantir plays a growing and important role in national security operations is beyond question. In its infancy, the company was nurtured by a venture capital firm founded by the Central Intelligence Agency. It made news this year by helping the Trump administration collect and compile personal information on millions of Americans. It has gotten attention for its work for U.S. military and intelligence agencies, police forces, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as many corporations and allied governments. Palantir’s executives say proudly that they are committed to ensuring the military supremacy of U.S., British, Israeli, Ukrainian and other friendly forces.\n\nBut Palantir has also been in the news for reasons that its executives emphatically dislike. Skeptical investors, among them Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager profiled in the movie, “The Big Short,” have bet that while Palantir is churning out enormous profits, it is nevertheless grossly overvalued by the market and its shares will soon fall.\n\nMr. Burry is winding down his hedge fund and returning money to investors because he says his views on pricing differ radically from the market’s. He placed a similar negative bet against Nvidia, which makes many of the advanced chips that power A.I. Nvidia has been the chief beneficiary of the A.I. boom, with a market valuation that, for a short while recently, surpassed $5 trillion. Nvidia hasn’t responded publicly.\n\nNot so, Palantir. In a recent interview on CNBC, its chief executive, Alex Karp, described Mr. Burry’s bets against Palantir as “batshit crazy.”\n\nPeter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and an early Trump supporter, was also one of Palantir’s founders and remains its chairman. The company’s earnings calls with Wall Street analysts aren’t confined to the discussion of revenue and growth prospects that other companies favor.\n\nInstead, there is, routinely, a sprinkling of bellicose, patriotic comments that stress Palantir’s military bona fides.\n\n“We remain deeply committed to our founding mission of supporting the U.S. government,” Ryan Taylor, the company’s chief revenue officer, said this month. “We remain focused on delivering the most advanced defense capabilities in the world to the U.S. government and internationally to our allied partners around the world.”\n\nOr this, by Mr. Karp, who said later in the call that the world should marvel at Palantir’s fabulous profits, military excellence and pugnacity. The company, he said, “stood by the American war fighter, marine special operators, people in clandestine services who stood up for our right of free speech.” It was, he said, “really the first company to be completely anti-woke.”\n\nMuch of its success, he said, comes from “making the American war fighter fight the way the American war fighter is born to fight.”\n\nGeopolitical crises are a problem for most of us. For Palantir, they are the company’s bread and butter. In that same earnings call, Shyam Sankar, the company’s chief technology officer, who in June became a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, said: “America is involved with three conflicts right now in the world, from Europe, the Middle East, and in our own hemisphere right now. And things are getting a little spicy.” The conflicts provide “opportunities” for Palantir.\n\nIn the stock market, the company’s growth has been meteoric. Named for the spherical objects used in the “Lord of the Rings” books to gain a clear view of all of fictional Middle-earth, Palantir became a publicly traded company in 2020, in the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIts business thrived during the Biden administration. But its shares took off with President Trump’s re-election. From Nov. 5, 2024 through Thursday, its shares rose 240 percent. In the S&P 500, that was second only to Robinhood, the online trading app for stocks, cryptocurrency and prediction markets.\n\nPalantir’s market value reached $490 billion briefly this month, prompting a Wall Street Journal analysis that found that no company had ever reached that valuation that quickly, and none had done it with so little in sales. In mid-August, The Economist magazine said “Palantir might be the most overvalued firm of all time.” I’ve noted before that, while Palantir’s revenues and profits were growing at an enormous speed, its share price seemed wildly generous, compared with other large companies.\n\nWith the help of Aigars Sležis, a consultant for FactSet in Riga, Latvia, I reviewed the numbers this past week. Yes, Palantir is extravagantly valued. Its price-to-earnings ratio is more than 400. That means that at the company’s current growth rate, it would take more than 400 years for Palantir’s earnings to equal its share price and 120 years for its sales to match that price.\n\nBy contrast, for the average company in the S&P 500, the comparable numbers are more than 28 times for earnings and more than three times for sales. Even those numbers are stretched, by historical measures, but they are modest compared with Palantir’s.\n\nThe company is growing far more rapidly and profitably than the average company. But can Palantir, or any company, grow fast enough to justify the price being paid for it? Similar questions may be asked of Nvidia and other profitable but richly valued companies.\n\nMillions of people are affected by these prices. If you hold stock mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, or have a share in a pension plan, there’s a good chance you own a piece of Palantir. The company is part of U.S. diversified stock funds offered by Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity and many other large fund managers.\n\nProbably because it doesn’t make military hardware, Palantir is also among the top 20 holdings of two of the three biggest funds that typically eschew military companies. These are Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Admiral and iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF. On the other hand, the Parnassus Core Equity Investor, the largest fund that emphasizes so-called “E.S.G.,” or environmental, social and governance principles,excludes Palantir.\n\nIt’s understandable that parts of the investing world haven’t caught up with Palantir. Nor has the general public. I see its ascendance as part of a long U.S. tradition.\n\nLong before the dawn of A.I., Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his farewell address as president in 1961, warned about the emergence of what he labeled “the military-industrial complex.” The United States, he said, needed to grapple with the “conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry.”\n\nHis parting words were: “The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”\n\nThe companies embedded in the military-industrial complex have fostered U.S. global dominance all my life, so I would never bet against what we might now call the A.I.-military industrial complex.\n\nPalantir has become an important part of this corporate-military universe, without question. Even so, I do wonder how the stock market can keep supporting its remarkable share price.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/world/middleeast/hamas-us-witkoff.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:01:27-05:00","title":"U.S. Envoy Said to Be Planning to Meet With Senior Hamas Official","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, is planning to meet with senior Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya to discuss the ongoing Gaza cease-fire agreement, signaling a continued effort to maintain direct diplomatic dialogue with a group designated as a foreign terrorist organization.

missions, is planning to meet with Khalil al-Hayya, the chief negotiator of Hamas, soon, according to two people familiar with Mr. Witkoff’s plans.\n\nA meeting between Mr. Witkoff and Mr. al-Hayya would underscore that the Trump administration is interested in keeping a direct line of communication with Hamas, even though the United States has designated the group a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nIt would also illustrate that Mr. Witkoff is not deterred by Israeli and American critics who say that U.S. engagement with Hamas offers the group unwarranted legitimacy.\n\nThe exact date that Mr. Witkoff plans to meet with Mr. al-Hayya, an architect of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, is still not clear, according to the two people familiar with the American envoy’s travel plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information. It was also possible that the plans would change.\n\nA representative of Mr. Witkoff declined to comment, as did Hamas officials. The White House did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nOne of the topics Mr. Witkoff intends to raise with the senior Hamas official is the cease-fire in Gaza, one of the two people said.\n\nIn October, Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal for a cease-fire in Gaza and an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The agreement has held together despite flare-ups in violence.\n\nMr. Witkoff and Mr. al-Hayya have met before. The first known time was in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in October before the signing of the cease-fire deal. That meeting was also attended by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law who helped broker the cease-fire.\n\nIn an interview broadcast on Oct. 19 on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Mr. Witkoff said he had offered condolences to Mr. al-Hayya for the loss of his son in September, when the Israeli air force fired missiles at a compound in Qatar where Hamas officials were meeting.\n\n“I told him that I had lost a son,” he said, “and that we were both members of a really bad club, parents who have buried children.”\n\nMr. Witkoff’s son, Andrew, died of an opioid overdose in 2011.\n\nMr. Witkoff is not the first Trump administration official to have met with Hamas. Adam Boehler, the U.S. envoy for hostage response, met with Hamas officials several times in Qatar in March in an effort to press for the release of a dual American Israeli citizen who was held captive by the group’ at the time.\n\nThose talks did not result in a deal.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/media/box-office-collapse-hollywood.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:01:46-05:00","title":"25 Movies, Many Stars, 0 Hits: Hollywood Falls to New Lows","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over the past three months, Hollywood has released 25 dramas and comedies featuring major stars like Julia Roberts, Jennifer Lawrence, Sydney Sweeney, and Jennifer Lopez, yet none of them achieved commercial success.

Many were championed by critics. Most had star power.\n\nBut not one of the 25 dramas and comedies that movie companies released in North American theaters over the past three months has become a hit, certainly not in the way that Hollywood has historically kept score. Some have played to near-empty auditoriums, including “After the Hunt,” staring Julia Roberts; “Christy,” with Sydney Sweeney; and “Die My Love,” featuring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson.\n\n“To succeed in theaters today, dramas and comedies must have event status — something truly elevated and special,” said Kevin Goetz, an author of the new book “How to Score in Hollywood,” which looks at film bankability.\n\n“It’s not a phase,” he added. “It’s an evolution you can’t reverse.”\n\nThe dearth has added to what has already been a troubled year for Hollywood. The summer season — filled with fantasies and science-fiction sequels — was the least attended since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the Covid-19 pandemic years.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nWhile success at the box office is always correlated to how much it costs to make a film, Hollywood has historically used $50 million in ticket sales (over an entire run) as a benchmark for a “widely seen” drama or comedy.\n\nBy that measure, “After the Hunt,” with Ms. Roberts playing a college professor combating cancel culture, is a catastrophe. It cost an estimated $70 million to make and collected $3.3 million in the United States and Canada after playing for a month.\n\n“Kiss of the Spider Woman,” starring Jennifer Lopez and Diego Luna, cost roughly $30 million and managed only $1.6 million in ticket sales over a month.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

After He Called ICE on Workers\n\nPublished: 2025-11-14T14:25:58-05:00\n\nThe president of the Boston University College Republicans has been attacked online for saying on social media that he had called immigration agents before a raid at a Boston carwash in which nine workers were detained.\n\nZac Segal, a Boston University junior and a track athlete, according to his school bio page, posted on social media on Nov. 7 that he had “been calling ICE for months” about workers at Allston Car Wash, near the Boston University campus in the Allston neighborhood. Federal agents swarmed the business on Nov. 4, detaining five women and four men who worked there, according to their lawyer, Todd Pomerleau. The workers are contesting their detentions in court, he said.\n\nMr. Segal’s post about the carwash included a link to an article about the raid. He wrote that immigration agents “finally responded to my request to detain these criminals. As someone who lives in the neighborhood, I’ve seen how American jobs are being given away to those with no right to be here. Pump up the numbers!”\n\nHundreds of people have attacked Mr. Segal online for his post. On the Instagram page of the B.U. College Republicans, one person wrote that “Zac Segal should be deported!” Another suggested more ominously, “Zac Segal should be afraid.” Mr. Segal also received messages of support on the social media platform X, such as “Patriot!” and “Thank you Zac.”\n\nMr. Segal did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. On Thursday, he reposted, without comment, messages calling him “racist and fascist” and labeling him a “neo-nazi.”\n\nHe also posted a screenshot of a Boston Globe article about his efforts to report the carwash workers to ICE, writing, “We must stand up for this country.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains a tip line and encourages citizens to report “suspicious activity” by phone or online.\n\nThe College Republicans of America, the national group with which B.U. College Republicans is affiliated, defended Mr. Segal for doing what the government had asked of him. “We call on all College Republicans to follow in the lead of this great patriot and notify their local ICE forces of any suspected illegal activity in their communities immediately,” Martin Bertao, the national group’s president, said in a statement.\n\nThe B.U. Republicans announced its affiliation with the College Republicans of America this week, after it broke away from another group, the College Republican National Committee, over concerns about its direction and allegations of misconduct.\n\nIt is not clear that Mr. Segal actually had anything to do with causing the Nov. 4 immigration raid in Allston. The Trump administration on Friday denied that Mr. Segal had brought agents to the carwash.\n\n“The operation was highly targeted and relied on law enforcement intelligence — not your silly rumor,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in an email.\n\nMr. Segal’s school bio says he is an economics major from London.\n\nThe attorney for the workers, Mr. Pomerleau, said they had been busy vacuuming cars when “military style” vehicles pulled up to the carwash. Masked agents who he said were clearly armed began making arrests. Those detained included a brother and sister and a pair of sisters. Another person is 67 and has lived in the United States for some 30 years, Mr. Pomerleau said.\n\nIn referring to the detained workers as “criminals” in his post, Mr. Segal “is spreading false information about nine people he doesn’t know,” Mr. Pomerleau said. “These people are not criminals.”\n\nHe expects bond hearings to begin soon. “All of them at a minimum are going to get due process under the law.”\n\nMr. Pomerleau said he has received an outpouring of support for the detained workers.\n\nBoston University did not immediately respond to messages on Friday.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/world/middleeast/west-bank-settler-violence-olive-harvest.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:37:27-05:00","title":"A Bloody Month in the West Bank: Olive Harvest Leads to the Death of a Boy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ayssam Ma’ala, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy from Beita in the West Bank, died after being exposed to tear gas during an olive harvest on October 11, 2025.

just laid down tarps to gather ripe olives in the West Bank town of Beita. It was Oct. 11, the first Saturday of the harvest, traditionally a high point of the year.\n\nThe day before, his family had been driven from another grove by extremist settlers who attacked them, witnesses said, in what has become a common occurrence in the West Bank. So on Saturday, they chose what seemed a safer spot. No settlers were in sight. Ayssam, 13, told his mother to rest in the shade, that “he’d take care of everything.”\n\nIsraeli soldiers soon emerged from an army vehicle a few hundred yards away and began firing tear gas, witnesses said. Caught in a cloud of gas from three canisters, and unable to breathe, Ayssam collapsed.\n\nAfter four weeks in a coma, Ayssam died on Tuesday. He became the first fatality in what has been a particularly violent olive harvest. Palestinians and activists — Palestinian, Israeli and Western — say bands of masked settlers have routinely assailed Palestinian villagers, activists lending their support and journalists there to bear witness. The attackers, they say, are emboldened by permissive law enforcement and by troops who seldom intervene to stop Jewish extremists.\n\nThe olive harvest has been central to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for generations. A good crop can keep a family afloat financially for a year, and bringing it in once meant picnics, togetherness and cookouts among the trees.\n\nThe Israeli military insists that its soldiers are under orders to allow the harvest, but activists say that the military often sides with the settlers or even tries to disrupt the harvest itself. Israeli military leaders have come under heightened pressure to crack down on settler violence, with some commanders saying they need the government to authorize harsher measures.\n\nIn Beita, members of Ayssam’s family speculated that the violence of the day before had prompted soldiers to disperse them pre-emptively. A military spokeswoman said that the incident was under review.\n\nPalestinians see the violence, and its tolerance by right-wing Israeli officialdom, as part of a broader campaign to harass them and make life so unbearable that they will eventually abandon their villages.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli settlements have cropped up at record speed on hilltops encroaching on villages across the West Bank.\n\nThe violence and land grabbing in the West Bank have only intensified since the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which set off the war in Gaza.\n\nSettler violence reached an all-time high in October, with 264 attacks, or about eight a day, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Palestinian Affairs, which began keeping records in 2006.\n\nThe office has counted 167 attacks on olive harvesters since Oct. 1, in which 151 Palestinians were injured, 83 of them by Israeli settlers and the rest by soldiers. It said the violence has affected more communities — and also more olive trees — than in the past six years.\n\nIn an attack caught on video and published in Israeli media, a woman harvesting olives in Turmus Aya, Afaf Abu Alia, 53, was beaten unconscious on Oct. 19 by a masked Israeli man wielding a club. On Sunday, the police arrested a suspect. Israeli media identified him as a 21-year-old resident of a nearby outpost.\n\nA man trying to harvest olives in Kufr Qaddum, Hekmat Shtewei, 51, was chased to his car by settlers on Oct. 28, according to his brother-in-law, Abd Al-Rahman Shtewei, who said he found him bleeding in his car. He was beaten so badly that he suffered multiple fractures to his skull, jaw, ribs, arms and legs, and slipped into a coma, according to a hospital report. He awoke only on Tuesday, his brother-in-law said.\n\n“What’s happening in the West Bank is a disgrace to humanity,” Abd Al-Rahman Shtewei said in an interview. “People here will not feel safe except in their graves.” The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe lamented, too, that Palestinians could not fight back in defending themselves. “Legally, we would be the ones charged,” he said. “All we can do is keep showing up on our land.”\n\nIsraeli and Western activists who join the olive harvest and journalists who are there to document the attacks have also been assaulted.\n\nLast weekend, Israeli activists joined villagers trying to harvest olives on a terraced hillside in Beita, when settlers began throwing rocks at them and beating some people with sticks. The injured included a Reuters photographer and her security adviser.\n\nOded Yedaya, 76, a photographer who runs an art school in Tel Aviv, was also wounded. He said he ran off to the side hoping to take pictures of the attackers but was chased down a steep hill by two of them and struck with at least two stones.\n\nThe first one hit him in the lower back. “I turned my head and yelled, ‘Criminals, leave me alone,’” he said in an interview.\n\nThe second stone knocked him out. He awoke covered in blood, his camera gone. He had a two-inch gash on his temple and a broken cheekbone.\n\nMr. Yedaya has attended olive harvests and political protests for many years and has been injured a few times. “This is the worst,” he said.\n\nThe Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJonathan Pollak, an Israeli organizer of Zeitoun 2025, a coalition of groups supporting the olive harvest, said the Oct. 7 attacks and the Gaza war had fueled hatred and fear of the Palestinians on the part of many Israelis, distracted international attention from the West Bank and created among extremist settlers “a sense of entitlement, and of seizing the moment.”\n\n“There’s a very, very strong sense of impunity, and lack of accountability,” Mr. Pollak said.\n\nThis year’s olive crop was already anemic, a result of drought last year, a spring heat wave and strong winds that blew many buds from the trees — reducing the economic incentive for people to go through with the harvest.\n\nSome Palestinians tried to persist. But they say many of them have been prevented from getting to their trees, whether by armed settlers who menace them or by soldiers deployed to protect the settlers.\n\nThe military says its soldiers are under orders to ensure the harvest’s continuation without interference. It acknowledges that in some areas of conflict, access to groves is restricted to landowners only, “to prevent friction.”\n\nBut Palestinians and activists say that soldiers in the field routinely declare whole swaths of land, well outside the designated areas, as “closed military zones” — which makes entering them a crime — for no other purpose than stopping villagers from getting to their trees.\n\nAnd getting to those trees is vital: Under Israeli law, farmlands that go uncultivated for several years can be seized permanently by the state, and often are.\n\nAmong the groups expressing solidarity with Palestinians trying to harvest olives is Rabbis for Human Rights, a liberal Jewish group that has sent volunteers to the West Bank dozens of times this fall.\n\nOn Oct. 28, two American women who tried to join up with the group in the West Bank village of Burin were arrested after soldiers said they had entered a closed military zone.\n\nLeila Stillman-Utterback, 18, who was in Israel on a gap year after graduating from high school in Vermont, said she and the other American — both in Israel on tourist visas — were deported three days later and barred from returning to Israel for 10 years. In an interview, she said she felt a “sense of betrayal” but was fighting the ban in court because she felt “an imperative to be there.”\n\nIn Beita, Ayssam and his family had tried to harvest olives on the first Friday of the season, Oct. 10, his relatives — including his mother, brothers, and uncles — said. They were driven off by the attacking settlers from a new outpost called Mevaser Shalom — Hebrew for “harbinger of peace.”\n\nThe next day, Ayssam woke up saying he wanted to go olive picking again, his mother, Ghuroub Hamayel, said in an interview. An older brother argued against it, worried about another attack, but Ayssam insisted.\n\nThey chose an olive grove farther away from the outpost, hoping to be left alone, Ms. Hamayel said.\n\nEran Maoz, an Israeli activist who arrived with another group of olive pickers on the same hillside earlier that morning, said soldiers drove by a few times and observed the activity but took no action. He said the harvesters assumed they had permission to be where they were.\n\nThe family had barely arrived and gotten started when the soldiers returned. This time, they got out of their vehicle.\n\n“We started packing up our stuff,” Ms. Hamayel said. “But that’s when they started shooting the gas.”\n\nIn a video recorded by Mr. Maoz that he shared with The New York Times, one of the villagers responded by yelling at the soldiers, “Don’t fire tear gas! You’re killing us here!”\n\nA soldier answered over a bullhorn: “We don’t want to use tear gas. Go, get out of here, beat it.” But the soldiers continued to fire tear gas, Mr. Maoz said, and one of those volleys overcame Ayssam.\n\nA hospital report obtained by The Times said that inhaling tear gas caused his heart to stop for several minutes and that he suffered from severe oxygen deficiency, requiring the use of a ventilator.\n\nHe was buried within hours of his death Tuesday night in a family plot not far from his home. The next morning, as other relatives remembered his smile, or his love of video games, or the way he once stared down Israeli soldiers who harassed him, his mother instead recalled her youngest child’s sweetness.\n\n“He used to ask me, ‘Mom, do you love me like I love you?’” Ms. Hamayel said. “And I’d say yes.”\n\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-last-chance.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:48:48-05:00","title":"Football Coach Who Was Focus of Netflix’s 'Last Chance U' Is Shot","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Beam, a renowned football coach and former athletic director at Laney College in Oakland, was gravely wounded in a shooting at the college’s athletics field house on November 13, 2025.

2025-11-13T19:48:48-05:00\n\nJohn Beam, a mainstay of the football coaching ranks in the East Bay who was profiled in the Netflix series “Last Chance U,” was gravely wounded on Thursday in a shooting at Laney College in Oakland, Calif., according to Ken Houston, a city councilman.\n\nMr. Beam, 66, is the community college’s longtime athletic director, having retired last year from more than four decades of coaching at the junior-college and high school levels.\n\nInformation about his condition was not immediately available from the authorities or the college, which said the shooting occurred around noon in the athletics field house, an 18,000-square-foot complex that includes locker rooms, team meeting rooms, a weight facility and classrooms.\n\nA motive was not given for the shooting, which prompted the Oakland Police Department to briefly lock down the campus before determining that there was no longer an active threat. The campus, in downtown Oakland, remained closed.\n\nMr. Houston said in an interview that Mr. Beam was in his office when the shooting happened. “It’s not good in Oakland right now,” he said. “He is a legend in our city.”\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday afternoon, James Beere, the city’s assistant police chief, said investigators were searching for a potential suspect, whom he described as a man wearing a black hoodie and dark clothes.\n\nIn a statement, the Peralta Community College District, which the school is part of, said the victim, a senior member of the athletic staff it did not name, was immediately taken to a local hospital.\n\n“This is a frightening moment for our community,” the statement said.\n\nBarbara Lee, a former congresswoman who is Oakland’s mayor, said in a statement on Thursday that police were investigating.\n\n“I am heartbroken by today’s shooting at Laney College — the second shooting on an Oakland campus in one week,” Ms. Lee said. “We must continue confronting the ongoing gun violence crisis that is robbing our community of safety and stealing futures.”\n\nA day earlier, a student was wounded and two juveniles were arrested in connection with a shooting at Skyline High School — where Mr. Beam once coached.\n\nRevered for his coaching style and winning on the gridiron in Oakland — first at Skyline High and later at Laney College — Mr. Beam introduced himself to television audiences on the Netflix series “Last Chance U.”\n\nDuring its fifth season in 2020, the show followed Mr. Beam and the Laney College Eagles, when his face was featured in a promotional image for the series and viewers became acquainted with Mr. Beam’s holistic approach to coaching young men, many of whom had rough upbringings.\n\nHis penchant for hugging his players and talking to them about the importance of being vulnerable was a departure from some other coaches who had been featured on the show.\n\n“To many young men, especially young men of color, showing your vulnerability is a sign of weakness,” Mr. Beam told The New York Times in 2020. “And we’re trying to say: ‘No. It’s not. In fact, it’s a sign of strength. Asking for help is a strength move, a power move.’”\n\nThe series, which offered a glimpse into the rough-and-tumble world of junior-college football, chronicled the economic plight of many of his players, who used food stamps and bunked together in studio apartments.\n\nUntil 2019, the California Community College Athletic Association barred sports programs from providing special food assistance to athletes, rules that caused Mr. Beam to bristle.\n\n“When a kid was hungry, I couldn’t go out and get him a Cup O’ Noodles — that was considered an impermissible benefit because I’m giving it to an athlete and not everybody,” Mr. Beam said.\n\nRejzohn Wright, a cornerback for the New Orleans Saints who was also featured on “Last Chance U,” was one of several of Mr. Beam’s former Laney College players to pay tribute to him on social media. On Instagram, he shared a photo of Mr. Beam placing his hands over his shoulder pads, their heads touching.\n\n“You mean the world to me,” he wrote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/nyregion/ues-nypd-shooting-madison-avenue.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:16:38-05:00","title":"Police Shoot Man They Say Menaced Bystanders on the Upper East Side","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 20-year-old man named Elijah Brown pulled a gun in an elevator at Madison Avenue and East 106th Street in New York City, then targeted a deli worker and threatened to shoot at a hospital.

He was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, three blocks north, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nNo one else was struck or injured, though the gunplay occurred just after people had stepped off a nearby M.T.A. bus, Philip Rivera, chief of patrol for the Police Department, said at a news conference on Thursday night. The man “shot at our officers on a busy sidewalk with civilians in close proximity,” Chief Rivera said.\n\nBy Friday morning, the scene still showed traces of the previous evening’s mayhem. Pedestrians stepped around a streak of blood on the sidewalk behind a bus shelter, which was also spattered. Streaks on a residential building facing the street revealed apparent ricochets.\n\nThe shootout was the culmination of an alarming series of events, the police said. At 7 p.m., Mr. Brown had been riding an elevator with another man inside an apartment building near the corner of Madison Avenue and East 106th Street. The two men chatted as the elevator descended, Chief Rivera said.\n\nThen, without warning or provocation, Mr. Brown pulled a handgun and aimed it at the other man, Chief Rivera said. He kept the gun pointed at the other man until the elevator reached the ground floor, where Mr. Brown walked out of the building. He walked a block north, to a deli, where he went behind the counter and aimed the weapon at a deli worker.\n\n“Call 911,” Mr. Brown told the worker, according to the police. “I’m going down to the hospital to shoot it up.”\n\nMr. Brown stole the deli worker’s phone, then walked south on Madison Avenue and went into the emergency department at Mt. Sinai. He came out again, placed the gun on the ground beside a tree, the police said, and walked back in.\n\nMr. Brown told an off-duty police officer working for the hospital as a security guard that he had a gun. As the officer tried to escort him out, Mr. Brown grabbed him from behind and they struggled. The emergency department staff sheltered in place until it was confirmed that the threat had passed, Brendan G. Carr, the C.E.O. of Mount Sinai Health System, said in an email sent on Friday afternoon to hospital employees.\n\nMr. Brown retrieved his gun and proceeded south while the off-duty officer called for assistance. At Madison Avenue between 96th and 95th Streets, officers in several vehicles stopped to apprehend him.\n\nChaos ensued, according to the police. Mr. Brown began firing at officers as they stepped out of their vehicles, Chief Rivera said. The officers returned fire, striking Mr. Brown fatally.\n\nMr. Brown’s movements and the final shootout were captured by surveillance cameras along his route and body cameras worn by the police officers, Chief Rivera said. In video captured by cameras facing the sidewalk near 96th Street, a man walks unhurriedly north on Madison, carrying what appears to be a gun in his left hand. Three police officers run after him. Then they stop, draw their weapons, and fire. Four pedestrians fall to the ground in fright.\n\nThe man turns and appears to fire at least one shot toward the officers on the sidewalk, then points the weapon at another officer in the street. The officers fire, striking him, and he falls to the ground.\n\nMarissa Zackowitz said she had been in her apartment on East 96th Street at the time of the shooting. Her first indication of trouble had come when her nanny took longer than usual to return from walking the family’s two dogs, she said. When the nanny returned the dogs were shaking in fear, Ms. Zackowitz said. The nanny told her that they had been caught near the violence.\n\n“It was scary,” said Ms. Zackowitz, 49. “This is the first time in my life I’ve ever said, ‘I want to leave this city.’”\n\nOutside the building at Madison Avenue and 106th Street where the incident began, residents on Friday morning said they hadn’t witnessed anything and did not know Mr. Brown. Many seemed unfazed.\n\n“It’s horrible,” said Ulysses Coleman, 62, who lives in the building where Mr. Brown pulled a gun in the elevator. “It’s something that we see every day, though.”\n\nAnusha Bayya contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-epstein-prison.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:04:25-05:00","title":"Why Is Ghislaine Maxwell Being Pampered in Prison?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking network, is receiving extraordinary privileges at a minimum-security federal prison, including private visits, access to computers, unlimited toilet paper, and special workout and recreation access. These privileges—contrary to standard policies for convicted sex offenders—have sparked outrage among prison staff and lawmakers, particularly after newly released emails between Maxwell and Epstein suggest she may have knowledge of a secret connection between Trump and Epstein. The emails, such as one where Epstein writes that 'the dog that hasn’t barked is Trump,' raise questions about potential political collusion.

The warden, he said, personally arranged for Maxwell to meet privately with family members and other visitors and even provided snacks and refreshments. According to Raskin, her guests were allowed to bring computers, potentially allowing her unauthorized communication with the outside world.\n\nMaxwell was allegedly taken to the prison’s exercise room after hours so she could work out alone, and “allowed to enjoy recreation time in staff-only areas,” wrote Raskin. An inmate who trains service dogs was reportedly instructed to give her special access to a puppy. Raskin claimed that a top official at the prison said that he is “sick of having to be Maxwell’s bitch.”\n\nSome of the details in Raskin’s letter were confirmed on Thursday by CNN, which added one more. Whereas other inmates carefully conserve their toilet paper because they’re given only two rolls a week, CNN reported, Maxwell “is given as much toilet paper as she needs. All she has to do is ask.”\n\nWhat’s shocking here is not that Maxwell is being treated decently — all prisoners should be — but that she’s being treated so much better than everyone else. The relative pampering she’s enjoying seems particularly significant given newly released emails between her and Epstein suggesting she’s harboring some sort of secret about Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three messages from a tranche they’d received from Epstein’s estate. (Perhaps trying to drown them out, Republicans then released more than 20,000 more.) “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump,” Epstein wrote to Maxwell in 2011. One of his victims, Epstein wrote, “spent hours at my house with him. He has never once been mentioned.” Maxwell responded, “I have been thinking about that.”\n\nMuch about this email is ambiguous. Epstein could have been suggesting that Trump was keeping something quiet. Or he might have been expressing surprise that Trump hadn’t yet been dragged into his mess. Presumably, Maxwell could clear things up and explain the exact nature of Trump and Epstein’s entanglement. That’s why it’s striking that the Bureau of Prisons — which is part of the Justice Department — seems to be taking such extraordinary steps to keep her happy. Maybe there’s an innocent explanation for all the privileges she’s being accorded, but I can’t think of one.\n\nRecall that on July 22, after Trump’s Justice Department and F.B.I. essentially closed the Epstein case, the House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena Maxwell to testify. That day, Todd Blanche, the former Trump defense attorney now serving as deputy attorney general, announced he’d interview Maxwell himself. When they met, she told him she’d never witnessed Trump doing anything untoward. (She said the same of Epstein.)\n\nJust days after speaking to Blanche, Maxwell was moved to a federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, a much less restrictive facility with a reputation for relative comfort. The transfer was highly unusual because, under Bureau of Prisons policy, convicted sex offenders like Maxwell are not typically eligible for minimum security.\n\nMany inside the system, Raskin told me, are upset about all the exceptions apparently being made for her. “There are lots of people in the prison, and there are lots of people in the government, who are extremely disenchanted with the favoritism and indulgences being showered upon Ghislaine Maxwell,” he said.\n\nThese indulgences look like part of a broader pattern. We’ve seen in recent days how desperate Trump is to keep the Justice Department’s Epstein files from coming out. For months now, Representatives Ro Khanna, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, have been collecting signatures on a so-called discharge petition to override House leadership and force a vote on the files’ release. This week, they got the signature they needed to put their measure over the top, thanks to the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona.\n\nOne of a handful of House Republicans to sign onto the petition was Lauren Boebert, usually a MAGA loyalist. On Wednesday, CNN reported that she’d been summoned to the Situation Room to meet with Blanche, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, to discuss the files. Boebert, who didn’t reverse her stance, denied that they’d tried to pressure her. But it’s extraordinary to have the leading law enforcement officials in the nation seemingly working to stop the vote, especially since even if the measure gets to Trump’s desk, he can just veto it.\n\nThe emails released this week don’t get us much closer to understanding what Trump could be hiding. Indeed, an email Epstein sent a few months before his arrest in 2019 suggests that while Trump might have been aware of Epstein’s child abuse, he didn’t participate in it. “He never got a massage,” Epstein wrote. Yet Epstein also seemed confident that he knew something damaging about Trump. “I am the one able to take him down,” he said in a 2018 text message about Trump.\n\nOf course, Epstein was a self-aggrandizing criminal. The question remains: Why is Trump acting like he was right?\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

could make it harder for immigrants to get green cards and other approvals if they are from countries subject to the president’s travel ban, according to internal documents from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAs part of the expected change, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would consider what it called “country-specific factors” included in President Trump’s travel ban as “significant negative factors” when reviewing applications for many immigration requests, with certain exceptions, according to draft documents reviewed by The New York Times. The policy is still being finalized.\n\nThe policy change is a major expansion of the administration’s push to crack down on immigration from countries that it says lack sufficient screening and vetting for official documents. The shift would make it more challenging for those who arrived in the country before the travel ban to remain.\n\nThe change is also the latest effort by the Trump administration to narrow paths for legal immigration. Last month, the administration cut the number of refugees it would admit to the United States this fiscal year, rejecting thousands of people fleeing war and persecution while reserving slots for mostly white Afrikaner South Africans.\n\nThe policy change comes after Mr. Trump in June signed a travel ban on 12 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. The ban bars travel to the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nThe ban also imposed partial restrictions on citizens from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Citizens of those countries cannot enter the United States permanently or receive certain visas.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
