Marjorie Taylor Greene  and attacked her in personal terms, while the congresswoman countered that Trump was trying to make an example of her to prevent the release of files on  convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  The president’s post marked a major political breakup  weeks in the making  – a dramatic intensification of a simmering  back-and-forth between the two former allies , who grew apart as Greene criticized Trump on a number of fronts. It spilled into a messy exchange of blows as the controversy around Epstein again took center stage in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene,” Trump said in a  post  to social media, adding that Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026, has “gone Far Left.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene has publicly warned in recent weeks that Trump has been too focused on foreign policy and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home – taking her message to outlets like CNN and  ABC’s “The View.”  Greene, who arrived in Congress in 2021, has until recently been an ardent and outspoken Trump supporter.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican responded to Trump in a  social media post  Friday, writing, “Of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Friday, Trump defended his efforts to engage with foreign leaders and travel abroad amid Greene’s criticism, suggesting that his relationships on the world stage have benefited her district and expressing openness to endorsing a potential primary challenger.\n \n\n   \n  “Marjorie Taylor Greene said, ‘Oh, gee, I’m spending too much time overseas. So let’s say I don’t meet with China. You know what’s happened right now to Georgia? To every other state?” Trump said aboard Air Force One.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “They’re not working because your magnets and your rare earths would’ve kicked in, and there wouldn’t have been a factory in the world working if I didn’t have a relationship overseas with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that he is in the United States “95, 98% of the time.”\n \n\n   \n  “The last thing I want to do is travel 22 hours in an airplane, as nice as this plane is,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump warned that Greene has “changed” politically in recent weeks as the Georgia congresswoman has publicly lambasted the White House’s messaging on the government shutdown and Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that her constituents aren’t going to be happy. Already, I have people calling me. They want to challenge her to a race in her district in Georgia,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he was open to endorsing a rival GOP candidate in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  Greene is one of four House Republicans who has signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on release of Justice Department documents pertaining to the Epstein case, but CNN has reported that the number of House Republicans that could break from Trump and vote for the files’ release could be greater. Trump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  But Greene’s message has also extended more broadly to target Trump’s economic policies, suggesting that the White House needs to improve its messaging on affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  Greene fired back in her social media post on Friday with a pair of screenshots of text messages that appeared to be sent to Trump and his aide, Natalie Harp.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans, she wrote, “wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to a contact in her phone labeled “DJT,” Greene encouraged Trump to “lean into” Epstein’s ties to other high-profile figures and what she described as the “deep state.” In a separate message to Harp, she voiced her support for Trump but said the White House must “stop ignoring the women. … Them being raped as teenagers is not a hoax.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/media/disney-youtube-tv-new-deal-espn-abc","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00Z","title":"Disney Content Returns to YouTube TV Under New Deal","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney and YouTube TV have reached a multi-year agreement to restore Disney’s extensive broadcast content—including ESPN, ABC, FX, and National Geographic—to YouTube TV, ending a two-week blackout that began after a negotiation impasse on October 31, 2025.

in people is behind first human case in US in nine months \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Washington resident has been hospitalized with bird flu, according to the Washington State Health Department, and they’re infected with a strain of the virus that hasn’t been seen in humans before.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months, but the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  says that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.\n \n\n   \n  The patient, who has been hospitalized with H5N5 avian influenza since early this month, is described as an older resident of Grays Harbor County who has underlying health issues. It isn’t clear exactly how they caught the virus; state and local public health and agriculture officials are investigating, but they suspect that the person may have been exposed through backyard poultry.\n \n\n   \n  The virus spreads through an animal’s saliva, mucus and feces, or through milk from dairy cattle. The general risk of bird flu goes up in the late fall and winter as birds migrate and come into contact with other animals like backyard flocks.\n \n\n   \n  Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.\n \n\n   \n  There has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus in the US, but public health leaders in Washington are contacting people who may have been in close contact with the Grays Harbor patient to check for symptoms and offer testing and treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the overall risk to the public is low, Dr. Richard Webby says, the virus still has “pandemic potential.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s clear it’s not an easy leap for this virus to make, to switch from being a duck virus to being a human virus. I think that’s pretty clear, but I certainly wouldn’t put money on the fact that it can’t make that leap,” said Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. “It’s going to take a little bit of the biologic stars aligning for that to happen. We could argue exactly how likely that is, but no one actually knows. Only time will tell us, unfortunately.”\n \n\n   \n  Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the ongoing outbreak, according to the CDC. One person died in January who was also elderly and had underlying conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.\n \n\n   \n  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington State Department of Health urges people cleaning up around bird feeders and other areas exposed to bird feces to wear gloves and disinfect the area with a mixture of one part bleach to 10 parts water or a commercial disinfectant like Lysol spray.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. If disposing of a dead bird, wear a well-fitting face mask and disposable gloves, and use an inside-out plastic bag to pick up the carcass. The health department suggests double-bagging the bird and disposing of it in a sealed trash can so other animals don’t try to eat it. Wash hand thoroughly afterwards.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid consuming uncooked, undercooked or unpasteurized food like raw cheese or raw milk.\n \n\n   \n  The health department also recommends getting a flu shot. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/appeals-court-declines-probable-cause-order-trump-officials-contempt","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:19:00-05:00","title":"Appeals court declines to reinstate order finding ‘probable cause exists’ to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A divided federal appeals court declined to reinstate a lower court’s finding that probable cause exists for criminal contempt against Trump administration officials for violating a court order to halt deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.

\nUpdated: \n        7:19 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A divided federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration on Friday in a case over the president’s use of the  Alien Enemies Act  in deportation matters — but it did not fully snuff out a lower court judge’s efforts to punish those who ignored previous orders halting the president’s use of the law.\n \n\n   \n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday declined to reinstate an order from US District Judge James Boasberg that found “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for violating his prior orders to temporarily stop using the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday appeals court ruling is the latest blow to Boasberg’s efforts to hold accountable the administration officials who didn’t follow his orders earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three months ago, a three-judge panel of the appeals court wiped away Boasberg’s contempt ruling from April. Now, the entire appeals court has decided to keep that ruling intact.\n \n\n   \n  But the court’s decision does not fully tie Boasberg’s hands. Because of the way the appeals court ruled this summer – and the court’s decision on Friday to not disturb that ruling – Boasberg is able to move forward with his fact-finding inquiry around the officials involved in the matter, and several members of the court went out of their way to make that point clear Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court remains free to require the government to identify the decision makers who directed the potentially contemptuous actions and to carefully consider next steps,” three appeals court judges wrote in a statement respecting the court’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the migrants at the center of the case, said the court’s latest ruling “allows us to go back before Judge Boasberg and present all of the new evidence from the whistleblower that the government deliberately violated the court’s order not to hand over the Venezuelan men to El Salvador.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, an ex-Justice Department lawyer alleged in a whistleblower complaint that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration intended to ignore court orders as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  In court proceedings this summer, Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, raised the whistleblower’s claims, saying he would be interested in scrutinizing them should any contempt proceedings before him start back up.\n \n\n   \n  Three judges at the DC Circuit – all of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents – dissented from the court’s decision on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In a stinging dissent penned by appeals court Judge Florence Pan, the appointee of former President Joe Biden skewered the Trump administration’s “meritless appeal” of Boasberg’s ruling from April and her colleagues’ earlier decision to scramble the judge’s plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Our constitutional system was functioning as designed until a panel of this court improvidently intervened,” Pan wrote. “The district court was called upon to check an allegedly unlawful policy implemented by the Executive Branch. When the government apparently defied a court order, the district court properly investigated. In merely seeking information about the government’s apparent contempt of court, the district court did not violate any nondiscretionary duty nor clearly abuse its discretion.”\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, she said, “did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Pan also pointed to comments from President Donald Trump earlier this year that were critical of Boasberg as the case was unfolding. Trump called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “We should not leave in place a ruling that says that the district court erred when it did not,” she wrote. “We live in a world in which judges face threats and harassment because of their rulings and have been called ‘rogue’ by government officials who disagree with them. And we cannot overlook that, in response to this very case, the President of the United States called for the district judge’s impeachment.”\n \n\n   \n  She continued: “The district court performed its constitutional duty with unwavering integrity and courage, in the face of undue public criticism from the most powerful official in our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  In the case before Boasberg, the judge had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.\n \n\n   \n  The flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court ultimately determines that the Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,”  Boasberg wrote in a 46-page ruling detailing his decision  in April.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/epstein-texts-stacey-plaskett","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:58:00-05:00","title":"Del.

The congresswoman has previously made clear her long record combating sexual assault and human trafficking, her disgust over Epstein’s deviant behavior and her support for his victims.”\n \n\n   \n  The texts,  first reported by the Washington Post , were released Wednesday as part of  roughly 20,000 pages of documents made public  by the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  The released text messages redact the name of the person Epstein was texting with on February 27, 2019 — the day former Trump personal   attorney  Michael Cohen  testified to the House Oversight Committee about the president’s conflicts of interests, business practices and payments to Trump’s alleged mistresses to silence their stories before the 2016 elections.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post analyzed the text messages and compared them to footage of the hearing to report Plaskett was texting Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Epstein had already been convicted of two state prostitution charges, which he served 13 months for.

Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:13 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. The staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports, frozen at 6% since Wednesday night when the shutdown ended, will drop to 3% starting on Saturday, the Department of Transportation said.\n \n\n   \n  “The 3 percent reduction will remain in place while the FAA monitors system performance throughout the weekend and evaluates whether normal operations can resume,” the DOT said in a news release on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would “allow U.S. airlines to restore their operations ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday.”\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Andy Rose, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-epstein-doj-investigate-enemies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he’s asking Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s ties to slew of high-profile figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a federal criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s relationships with high-profile individuals, including Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, and JPMorgan Chase. This move comes shortly after Democrats released emails from Epstein that referenced these figures, prompting Trump to claim the information is part of a 'hoax' designed to distract from government shutdowns and other failures. Bondi confirmed the investigation and assigned Jay Clayton to lead it, though the DOJ may resist releasing Epstein-related files during an active probe, citing concerns over integrity. Critics, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and conservative commentator Megyn Kelly, argue that the investigation is a tactic to avoid transparency and that the files should be released to expose potential connections. Meanwhile, political pressure is building in Congress, with House Speaker Mike Johnson planning a vote on file disclosure, indicating growing bipartisan interest in accountability. Despite no criminal charges against Trump or the named individuals, the episode reflects broader tensions over political transparency, accountability, and the use of past relationships to influence public discourse.","keyTakeAways":["President Donald Trump requested a federal criminal investigation by the Justice Department into Jeffrey Epstein's connections with prominent individuals such as Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, and JPMorgan Chase.","Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump’s directive, assigning Jay Clayton to lead it in New York’s southern district.","The investigation is being framed as a countermeasure to the release of Epstein-related emails by Democrats, which Trump claims are part of a 'hoax' designed to distract from government shutdowns and political failures.","The DOJ may resist releasing Epstein files during an active investigation, citing potential compromise of probe integrity — a legal and procedural basis that could influence congressional voting on file disclosure.","Trump has consistently denied any personal wrongdoing or connection to Epstein, and multiple emails involving Epstein predate his presidency;

Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later on Friday confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump’s orders, assigning Jay Clayton, the top prosecutor in New York’s southern district, to lead the federal probe.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you, Mr. President,” she wrote in a  post on X  that included a screenshot of Trump’s request.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, after Bondi ordered the FBI to review Epstein files for release, Justice and FBI officials conducted another assessment and determined there were no additional prosecutions that could be brought based on the evidence at hand, according to law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s move on Friday   represents the president’s most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of the president’s belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Why doesn’t he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he’s in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  lengthy thread on X , Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, blasted Trump’s directive and called on the administration to release all the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein,” he wrote, adding later, “I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Clinton  said on X : “These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Summers for comment about Trump’s demands for an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with (Epstein) years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump earlier this week  tried and failed  to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department’s Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.\n \n\n   \n  Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert some documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee that had not yet been released. Trump appeared to acknowledge Friday that was part of a bid by his administration to dissuade her from driving more conversation on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “When you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is, you’re not talking about how well we’ve done,” Trump added while speaking aboard Air Force One. “That’s the whole purpose behind them. They want to waste people’s time and some of the dumber Republicans like that, but it’s mostly Democrats, by the way.”\n \n\n   \n  But they could not change her mind.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  But the newly announced criminal investigation could give the Justice Department a new justification to resist turning over files — or convince some lawmakers to back off. Generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “This will certainly give members of Congress a basis on which to vote against disclosing the Epstein files,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. “If there’s an ongoing criminal investigation, that’s a perfectly good reason for Congress to back off or to vote no.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the controversy Friday night, Trump told reporters he and Epstein had “a very bad relationship for years,” and sought to turn the focus to those he had demanded face investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Summers, whatever his name is, and all of the other people that he spent time with, Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years. But he also saw strength, because I was president, so he dictated a couple of memos to himself. Give me a break. You’re gonna find out what did he know, with respect to Bill Clinton, with respect to the head of Harvard, with respect to all of those people that he knew, including JP Morgan Chase,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails released earlier this week, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration’s response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump doesn’t want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn’t prove anything,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In the 24 hours after the House Oversight Committee’s Wednesday release of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name, Trump had declined to take questions from the press. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.” He then took questions from reporters while flying to Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.\n \n\n   \n  He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.\n \n\n   \n  In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  Clinton and Epstein had been friendly in the early 2000s, with the former president appearing on Epstein’s private jet logs at least 16 times between 2002 and 2003 for trips he said were related to Clinton Foundation work. Clinton would  later write  that his relationship with Epstein had ended by 2003 before he was aware of the financier’s crimes. Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein’s survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell, Kit Maher, Evan Perez and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/americas/venezuela-maduro-noriega-panama-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00-05:00","title":"As Washington weighs options on Venezuela, US invasion of Panama offers an imperfect blueprint for military action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the historical precedent of the 1989 US invasion of Panama, targeting military dictator Manuel Noriega, who was accused of drug trafficking and election rigging.

invasion of Panama offers an imperfect blueprint for military action \n       \n  By Patrick Oppmann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:01 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Latin American strongman accused of drug trafficking and rigging elections openly defies the White House despite threats of military action.\n \n\n   \n  It was 1989 and the then military dictator of Panama Manuel Noriega, much like Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro today, had become public enemy number one in Washington, amid allegations that he took millions of dollars to allow drug cartels to operate in his country.\n \n\n   \n  The US invasion of Panama led to Noriega’s capture and restored democracy to the Central American nation.\n \n\n   \n  To some pushing for military action against Maduro, the Panama invasion seems like a model – however imperfect – for what the US is trying to accomplish in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Bush 41 took Panamanian leader Noriega down under similar circumstances,” Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) posted on X Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a drug caliphate in our backyard that includes Venezuela, Colombia and Cuba. I am very glad President Trump is dedicated to ending this reign of terror,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Officials from all three countries have denied any ties to trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Maduro, a committed socialist and longtime thorn in the side of US foreign policy aims in the region, Noriega, at least initially, presented himself as a US ally.\n \n\n   \n  Through much of his bloody rise to power in Panama – the small but geopolitically key country with its canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans – Noriega was a CIA asset, assisting to stamp out the spread of leftist governments in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  But as CIA arms flowed through Panama to support anti-communist rebels in Central America, Noriega had a secret: He was also allowing tons of cocaine to pass north to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega’s fungible loyalties led former US Ambassador to Panama Ambler Moss to declare of the Panamanian dictator, “You can’t buy him, but you can sure as hell rent him.”\n \n\n   \n  By 1989 Noriega’s double dealing and brutal crackdown on civil society led to Washington issuing an ultimatum: Go into exile or else.\n \n\n   \n  Like Maduro today – who vehemently denies US allegations of drug trafficking – Noriega had to choose whether to flee or face off with a military far superior to his own.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, retired Panamanian General Rubén Darío Paredes told CNN, Noriega opted for exile.\n \n\n   \n  “He began making arrangements for the succession of command according to the hierarchy, but he had a moment of weakness,” Paredes said. “When many of that group who had been exposed began to think about their fate, right? They were exposed, and they made common cause and convinced Noriega that he was the ultimate authority, that there was no turning back. Then Noriega backed down and that’s when the invasion happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing Noriega’s defiance and worsening repression, US President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama – codenamed “Operation Just Cause” – in December 1989, arguing Noriega’s rule posed a threat to US lives and security.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20,000 US troops on Panamanian soil, Noriega took refuge in the Vatican’s embassy in Panama City for 10 days. US troops surrounded the compound with loudspeakers blasting his hideout with deafening heavy metal music through the night.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega eventually surrendered to US Drug Enforcement Administration officials on January 3, 1990.\n \n\n   \n  His trial in 1991 was called the “trial of the century” by the DEA and eventually saw him found guilty on eight counts and sentenced to 40 years in jail.\n \n\n   \n  While taking down a repressive leader with ties to drug cartels – Maduro also faces a US indictment for trafficking – seems identical to US’ goals in Venezuela, there are important differences.\n \n\n   \n  Panama in 1989, when the US invasion took place, only had a population of 2.5 million, Venezuela’s population today is over 28 million.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s land mass is more than ten times the size of Panama – which, at the time of the invasion, hosted US military bases.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, as with Noriega when he considered exile, many in Maduro’s inner circle face US trafficking allegations or million-dollar rewards for their capture, making them unlikely to see him leave power without a fight.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, any US military action in Venezuela would likely have to contend with the country’s impenetrable jungles and dense slums, where gang members are so heavily armed that even the Venezuelan military rarely enters.\n \n\n   \n  Frank Mora, former US Ambassador at the organization of American states OAS who has studied how a possible US invasion could unfold and the hurdles the US military faces in deposing Maduro, said the US could topple the Venezuelan leader easily but keeping the peace is another matter.\n \n\n   \n  “The question of Venezuelan military capability is not a serious one,” Mora said. “It’s not one that could sustain a US invasion, but my concern has always been, it’s not just the time that it requires to bring down the regime, it’s the day after, and how do you maintain order in a country that has essentially collapsed?”\n \n\n   \n  While it remains unclear if the US will put any boots on the ground or even carry out strikes in Venezuela, increasingly it appears the US will not count on the support of many regional allies.\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference on Thursday, Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, who publicly opposed the Noriega dictatorship before the US invasion, said his country would not host any US forces that might take part in a military action against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “In relation to Venezuela we don’t have anything to do with that,” Mulino said. “Panama is not lending its territory for any hostile act against Venezuela or another country in the world.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"John Beam, Beloved Football Coach Featured in 'Last Chance U', Dies After Shooting on California Campus","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Beam, the beloved former football coach and mentor at Laney College in Oakland, died from gunshot wounds sustained in a targeted shooting on November 14, 2025.

Gloria Beltran announced at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Cedric Irving, Beltran said. The suspect was acquainted with Beam but did not have a close relationship with him, according to Oakland Assistant Chief of Police James Beere.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the news felt unthinkable.\n \n\n   \n  Piedmont Police Chief Frederick Shavies described Beam as a “father figure to thousands of not only men but young women,” someone who left an “indelible” imprint on Oakland and far beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds gathered for a vigil Thursday night, holding candles and hope as Beam fought for his life — the same way he had spent decades teaching young people to fight for their own, Shavies said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are aching,” Shavies said, reflecting on the man he had known since eighth grade — the man who stepped in with support after Shavies’ father died.\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s family said in a statement read by police: “We are devastated that John — our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, coach, mentor and friend — has passed. Our hearts are full from the outpouring of love and support from all who cared about him. We are deeply grateful for your continued prayers and ask for privacy during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, questions remain about what authorities described as a “very targeted incident,” as the suspect awaits formal charges. The case will be referred to the district attorney’s office for review.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about the suspect\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday at 11:53 a.m., Oakland Police officers responded to Laney College and found Beam suffering from gunshot wounds, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  Beam had been at the college’s fieldhouse, which houses the athletic training facilities, where he continued serving as athletic director after retiring as head football coach last year. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and listed in critical condition.\n \n\n   \n  Officials obtained photos of the suspect, who was later spotted at the San Leandro Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He was taken into custody and gave a statement to police regarding the shooting, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  “The ability to actually track the suspect after he left Laney College was a diligent effort and an amazing, heavy lift to go through hundreds of hours of surveillance footage so we could track that individual,” Beere, Oakland’s assistant chief of police, said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect played football at Skyline High School in Oakland, but not while Beam was employed there, authorities said. Although Irving was not a student at Laney College, he was often seen loitering on campus, Beere added.\n \n\n   \n  “Coach Beam, although (he and the suspect) did not have a close relationship, was open to helping everybody in our community, and this is not uncommon for him to have a relationship with someone that he would think needs help,” Beere said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said Irving was on campus for a specific purpose, though they did not specify what that was. While authorities described the encounter as targeted, Beere confirmed it was not connected to a robbery.\n \n\n   \n    A champion for second chances\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s impact on the game stretched across more than four decades. He began coaching in Oakland in 1982 as Skyline High School’s defensive coordinator before joining Laney College in 2004 as the running backs coach, later becoming offensive coordinator and eventually head coach in 2012. Under his leadership, Laney won two league titles.\n \n\n   \n  His influence reached far beyond the sidelines. More than 20 of Beam’s former players went on to the NFL, including seven who played in the Super Bowl, according to his  biography on the college’s website. \n \n\n   \n  His appearance in the 2020 season of “Last Chance U” introduced his tough-love mentorship style to a national audience and cemented his status as a champion for young athletes seeking a second chance.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n \n\n   \n  To the Bay Area, Beam was more than a coach. He was a builder of people, a steady presence, a believer in potential.\n \n\n   \n  Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee reflected on the profound impact Beam had on the community, calling his legacy one “we all have to lift up, given the way he mentored young people, people who never would have had a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Beam coached the mayor’s nephew when he attended Skyline High School, she said, calling Beam “a phenomenal human being.” His influence transcended the football field, she added; he was a mentor, a friend, and a source of guidance for students, athletes and community members from all walks of life.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor described the city’s grief, noting the outpouring of support from people across Oakland as the community struggles with the loss.\n \n\n   \n  “He was friends with everyone and encouraged everyone. He never thought anyone was a lost cause,” Lee told CNN on Friday. “People feel the void already and are grieving this loss like you would not believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Athletes across the country took to social media to mourn Beam, sharing photos and memories that capture the stunning impact he had on their lives. Chicago Bears cornerback Nahshon Wright  posted a group photo with Beam , writing simply, “Will forever miss you dawg.” New Orleans Saints cornerback Rejzohn Wright shared a  heartfelt homage,  captioning a cheerful photo of a trio posing with Beam, “Crushed.”\n \n\n   \n  “I pray my prayers strong enough,” Wright wrote over a memorial video montage of Beam guiding and inspiring his athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Both athletes shared a video from April 2023, taken days before the NFL draft, showing Beam at football practice. Wearing his signature sunglasses and mustache, he jokes with the players while offering guidance — a fleeting, tender glimpse of the warmth, humor, and care that made him much more than a coach.\n \n\n   \n  Closing his remarks during the news conference, Shavies said, “I know that if Coach were here, he’d finish by saying, ‘Two claps — ready, ready.’”\n \n\n   \n    Another life ‘stolen’ by gun violence\n \n\n   \n  Laney College was  placed on lockdown  Thursday after reports of a shooting, as police secured the area and launched an investigation. The campus reopened Friday with mental health and counseling services available, the college said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Peralta community is devastated by his shooting,” Chancellor Tammeil Gilkerson said in a message to employees. “We are stunned and heartbroken that such violence has touched our campus and one of the most respected and beloved members of our Laney, Peralta, and Oakland community.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilkerson described Beam as “a renowned coach, teacher, mentor, and leader whose impact extends far beyond athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Lee condemned the killing, saying gun violence has “stolen” another life and warning that the city cannot allow firearms to continue flooding its streets and destroying the very people “who are trying to save our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “Coach’s Beam’s legacy isn’t measured in championships or statistics,” Lee said in the statement Friday. “It’s measured in the thousands of young people he believed in, mentored, and refused to abandon … He gave Oakland’s youth their best chance, and he never stopped fighting for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident is Oakland’s second school shooting in two days.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, one juvenile was shot and two were arrested at Skyline High School,  police said . The juvenile who was shot was taken to the hospital and was in stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “It is devastating,” Lee added. “Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/20th-strike-us-military-boats-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"US military carried out 20th strike on alleged drug boats, killing 4, official says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted its 20th strike on an alleged drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing four individuals, bringing the total number of deaths in such operations to 80.

What happens next? \n       \n  By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump’s push to detain and  deport undocumented immigrants  en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.\n \n\n   \n  The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.\n \n\n   \n    What did the judge decide?\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was  nominated by  former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022 settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Cummings ruled  agents violated the  previously agreed upon consent decree .\n \n\n   \n  Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026,  and says  if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”\n \n\n   \n    Who will be released and when?\n \n\n   \n  Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Out of a list of the more than 600 detainees the Justice Department shared with the court, only 16 had explanations for why they were given an “ICE Further Designation of High Public Safety Risk.” The document indicates they were arrested for a range of charges, including for aggravated assault, DUI, domestic battery, and criminal conspiracy to traffic narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  The document also lists around 40 people as having a “high” risk to public safety designation – though officials do not provide the reasons why. CNN has reached out to Department of Homeland Security and DOJ attorneys for clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”\n \n\n   \n  The list of detainees CNN reviewed showed that 75 people have already been “removed” and multiple others are listed as having been “paroled” or “bonded out.”\n \n\n   \n    What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.\n \n\n   \n  But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.\n \n\n   \n  “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   “We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his CBP agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including  from a federal judge , for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin  previously told CNN , while  other immigration legal challenges  move through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago  amid protests against  the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Zoe Sottile, Dianne Gallagher and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/welsh-police-arrest-man-impersonating-navy-officer-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00Z","title":"Man Charged Over Allegedly Impersonating High-Ranking Navy Officer at Remembrance Sunday Parade","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Carley, a 64-year-old resident of Harlech, Wales, was arrested and charged with impersonating a high-ranking navy officer at a Remembrance Sunday wreath-laying ceremony in Llandudno on November 9, 2025.

juggernaut to withstand US tariffs. Can it keep its edge? \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Joyce Jiang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:37 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.\n \n\n   \n  With US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China’s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: “Nothing is more important than the markets close to us.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories like Wang’s have played out across China’s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties – and the threat of their return – upended Chinese exports to the world’s wealthiest market.\n \n\n   \n  The result has been a coup for China’s trade juggernaut.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world’s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world – building on the country’s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump’s first trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.\n \n\n   \n  But the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year’s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus – a balance that’s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump’s trade war in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  There were already questions about the sustainability of China’s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October – the first downturn since February.\n \n\n   \n  Whether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world – and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.\n \n\n   \n    China’s trade resilience\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, the shift in China’s export flows has been stark – and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.\n \n\n   \n  While exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.\n \n\n   \n  This trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.\n \n\n   \n  Already the world’s manufacturing superpower, China’s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply – and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those goods – like EVs and solar panels – were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China’s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.\n \n\n   \n  “(China) has prepared quite well for this,” said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it’s started, that trend has really accelerated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing’s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint – expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico – where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,” said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Without those outbound investments, I don’t think that China can cope with the shock.”\n \n\n   \n    A two-way street?\n \n\n   \n  But Beijing’s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.\n \n\n   \n  Countries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year – a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.\n \n\n   \n  For some Latin American countries, “deindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest … because they bring just the assembly, they don’t do technology and knowledge transfer,” said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a ‘tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.’ Of course that’s a concern to us,” said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn’t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “I know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it’s how do we manage this?”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump’s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Observers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US – that’s especially when there is true demand in many countries.\n \n\n   \n  In Africa, “it’s a two-way street,” said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.\n \n\n   \n  “These countries (in Africa) want to industrialize… there’s a massive electricity gap across the continent – solar panels are cheap and China’s got overcapacity … they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Getting squeezed’\n \n\n   \n  Even still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.\n \n\n   \n  Factory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.\n \n\n   \n  Garment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused “serious and irreversible long-term impact” without clear alternatives.\n \n\n   \n  With her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn’t feel “very confident,” even despite a potential return of some US business now, “since the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.”\n \n\n   \n  And there are questions about whether China’s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  An analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July – including the height of the trade uncertainty – suggests that just less than a quarter of China’s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Still, l’m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,” he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries’ trade talks with the US played out.\n \n\n   \n  “The big caveat,” he added, is that “the margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed … they’re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they’re doing it by cutting prices.”\n \n\n   \n  The recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.\n \n\n   \n  But as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country’s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China’s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/lower-tariffs-coffee-beef-bananas-produce","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:02:00Z","title":"Trump lowers tariffs on coffee, beef and fruits, as Americans’ concerns about affordability grow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on November 14, 2025, retroactively reducing tariffs on key agricultural imports such as beef, tomatoes, coffee, and bananas, effective from the previous day.

The Trump administration has sued California over a Democratic-drawn map designed to flip five Republican seats, approved by voters. The article emphasizes that redistricting, typically occurring once every decade, is now taking place mid-decade due to the tight House majority and political stakes.

The latest development is in Indiana, where the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, the Trump administration  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/opioid-settlement-oxycontin-purdue-sackler","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:32:00-05:00","title":"Judge says he’ll approve opioid settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue and Sackler family","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge, Sean Lane, has approved a landmark opioid settlement between Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, requiring the family to pay up to $7 billion and relinquish ownership of the company.

Purdue and Sackler family \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.\n \n\n   \n  The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion and give up ownership. The new agreement replaces one the US Supreme Court  rejected  last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies that totaled about $50 billion. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.” But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.”\n \n\n   \n    The opposition is much quieter this time around\n \n\n   \n  The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.\n \n\n   \n  The US Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for  Sackler family members  to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there’s been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing.\n \n\n   \n  A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough.\n \n\n   \n  “The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.\n \n\n   \n    Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements\n \n\n   \n  A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say.\n \n\n   \n  The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026.\n \n\n   \n  There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from  museums  and  universities .\n \n\n   \n  And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.\n \n\n   \n    Some people hurt by Purdue’s opioids would receive some money\n \n\n   \n  Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue’s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n \n\n   \n  All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. It would take up to 15 years for governments to receive their full allocations.\n \n\n   \n  About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive.\n \n\n   \n  People will have until March 1 to agree not to sue the Sacklers and apply for the funds.\n \n\n   \n  One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder.\n \n\n   \n  “Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. “Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers  have been dropping  in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/indiana-redistricting-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"Indiana Republican Senators Put Up a Roadblock to Trump’s Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indiana Republican lawmakers, led by Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, have blocked a special session to redraw congressional maps, citing lack of internal support.

Indiana Republican senators put up a roadblock to Trump’s redistricting push \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:03 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest sign of  resistance to President Donald Trump’s push  to redraw congressional lines, the Republican leader of Indiana’s state Senate on Friday said his chamber won’t meet for a special session to create additional GOP seats.\n \n\n   \n  Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said there aren’t enough votes to pass a new map.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” Bray said in a statement. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun – who had called the special session at the behest of Trump, Vice President JD Vance and the president’s political allies – indicated he would not relent from his demand that lawmakers gather to vote on new lines.\n \n\n   \n  “I called for our legislators to convene to ensure Hoosiers’ voices in Washington, DC are not diluted by the democrats’ gerrymandering,” Braun said in a statement. “Our state senators need to do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps. Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Indiana is the latest stumbling block in Trump’s high-stakes quest to remake congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Republican lawmakers in Kansas also have resisted calls to open a special session to redraw the state’s congressional map, although Kansas lawmakers could weigh new lines targeting the state’s lone congressional Democrat when legislators return for their regular session early next year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats need to gain just three seats in the US House after next year’s midterms to take control of the chamber and potentially block parts of Trump’s agenda during the final two years of his White House term.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana Republicans hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate. They also hold seven of the state’s nine congressional districts — but Trump had eyed the Democratic-held 1st District in northwestern Indiana and the 7th District in Indianapolis as possible avenues to add Republican-leaning districts and bolster his party’s narrow House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the mid-decade redistricting arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to create five additional GOP-friendly seats. So far, GOP-led mapmaking efforts have redrawn seats in four states – Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio – to add a total of nine potential seats to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Californians voted by a large margin to approve five additional Democratic-friendly districts, which represents the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state. On Thursday, the Trump administration’s Justice Department  joined a legal challenge  that seeks to block the California map from going into effect.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:30:00Z","title":"Gregory Bovino and CBP Headed to Charlotte, North Carolina — Officials Unaware of Planned Operation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that Gregory Bovino, the top official of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under the Trump administration, is reportedly planning to send federal immigration agents to Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of a broader crackdown on Democratic-led cities.

That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:30 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  US Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes much of Charlotte, wrote she was “extremely concerned about the deployment of U.S. Border Patrol and ICE agents to Charlotte” in  a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and what we have seen border patrol and ICE agents do in places like Chicago and Los Angeles – using excessive force in their operations and tear gassing peaceful protesters – threatens the wellbeing of the communities they enter,” Adams said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Bovino  wrote , “Immigrants rest assured, we have your back like we did in Chicago and Los Angeles,” and urged undocumented immigrants to  self-deport .\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein encouraged residents who see inappropriate behavior to record it on their phones and notify local law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “We should all focus on and arrest violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” the governor said in a statement. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials were in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/weather/southern-california-storm-flooding-risk-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:56:00Z","title":"Multi-day storm is threatening flooding and mudslides in Southern California: What to expect and when","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A multi-day Pacific storm is bringing heavy rainfall to Southern California, particularly affecting the Los Angeles region.

Widespread  rainfall totals  of 1 to 2 inches fell along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco received nearly an inch and a half of rain Thursday, almost  75% of November’s average. November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  The flood threat has intensified since then as an  atmospheric river  feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on both Friday and Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n \n\n   \n  An initial wave of heavy rain for Southern California caused flooding and a mudslide late Thursday night on portions of Highway 101 in southern Santa Barbara County, according to the National Weather Service. This round of rain is expected to ease by Friday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  A second, more intense wave will move into the region Friday night into Saturday, with prolonged heavy rain possible. Rainfall rates could be as high as an inch per hour at times.\n \n\n   \n  This second round of rain will also have the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through 10 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service warns that the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.\n \n\n   \n    Burn scar areas on alert\n \n\n   \n  Areas burned by recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows.\n \n\n   \n  Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders in effect from Friday evening to Sunday morning cover parts of the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, but those are not the areas at risk of dangerous debris flows.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the Eaton and Bridge burn scars also have a high threat of “significant” debris flows, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest rain should ease late Saturday, but the region isn’t in the clear right away. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated.

markets are suddenly on edge \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:08 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For months, it felt like nothing could knock stocks off their steady ascent — but November has been a rough month on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down almost 3.5% this month and on track for its first losing month since March. The Nasdaq has shed roughly $1.74 trillion in market value in two weeks as investors have dumped tech stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks opened sharply lower Friday before bouncing off their lows as investors bought the dip. The major indexes wavered into the closing bell. The Nasdaq turned positive and closed higher by 0.13% after briefly falling almost 1.9%. The S&P 500 fluctuated and closed lower by 0.05%. The Dow fell 310 points, or 0.65%.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks were set for another horrific session at the open following yesterday’s debacle but investors saw the sharp dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  The benchmark S&P 500 is still down 1.55% this month while the Dow is down 0.87%. The S&P 500 has shed more than $1.3 trillion in market value in just over two weeks as it has retreated from a record high set in late October.\n \n\n   \n  After months of gains, investors have outsized expectations, making them easer to disappoint. Tech stocks have become  relatively pricey .\n \n\n   \n  And after the government shutdown halted official data releases for weeks, investors are unsure what the new figures,  as government releases resume,  will show about the state of the world’s biggest economy. That, in turn, is stoking uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in December, and adding to the Wall Street jitters.\n \n\n   \n  “When the government was shut down, we could believe whatever we wanted to believe,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN’s Matt Egan. “Now we need to be data dependent, and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n  Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence carried the market to new record highs this year. But now some investors are hitting pause, taking profits and reassessing whether those stocks will continue to produce superior returns.\n \n\n   \n  “With lofty valuations in AI-related stocks, it’s understandable that investors are on edge about anything that might go wrong,” Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin, which can serve as a gauge of how risk-on investors are feeling, slid 4% on Friday and hovered around $94,500. The cryptocurrency has tumbled 25% since it hit a record high in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Data deluge incoming\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street and the Fed are awaiting a deluge of economic data that was delayed due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That is contributing to mounting nerves about the Fed’s next move. Traders on Friday were pricing a 46% chance the central bank will cut rates in December, down from a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the last policy meeting, in October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cast some doubt on whether the Fed would cut rates again this year. Fed officials — including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who is a voter on policy moves this year — delivered remarks this week that have shown hesitancy to continue cutting rates.\n \n\n   \n  While Evercore ISI analysts in a note said they still see an interest rate cut next month, they think it’s “very hard to call” because of a combination of factors, including “data blindness.”\n \n\n   \n  The central bank’s rate cuts in September and October boosted stocks, and a pause on rate cuts could pose troubles for stocks that have rallied on expectations for lower borrowing costs — in particular, the AI and tech stocks that have propelled the market higher.\n \n\n   \n  “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday, according to  CNN’s Fear and Greed index .\n \n\n   \n  But some investors say a pullback in stocks can also be healthy.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq gained every month from April through the end of October. Now, the market is resetting as investors reassess the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “This (pullback) is somewhat overdue, and I don’t think it’s the start of a  correction ,” Yardeni said.\n \n\n   \n    AI jitters\n \n\n   \n  There is also increasing skepticism about whether Big Tech companies can make enough money to justify the enormous spending taking place on AI deals now.\n \n\n   \n  “The technology sector has faced selling pressure in recent weeks amid concerns over rising debt issuance and a surge in capital expenditures” like new data centers, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, told CNN’s Matt Egan in an email. “Investors are questioning whether these investments will translate into future profitability.”\n \n\n   \n  Oracle shares ( ORCL ) surged 36% in one day on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Shares in Oracle have tumbled since then, erasing those gains.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies announcing large supply deals with OpenAI have similarly been met with skepticism around OpenAI’s ability to deliver on its financial objectives,” John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Oracle facing pressure. Meta shares ( META ) are down 23% since hitting a record high in mid-August. Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) are down 10% since hitting a record high in late October. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) are down 16% since hitting a record high on November 3.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happened recently in the market isn’t even close to a tech wreck, but it may be a bit of a tech reckoning,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team.\n \n\n   \n  To Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, this month has been defined by investors rotating out of tech stocks and into other sectors.\n \n\n   \n  The recent pullback, he said, feels like “investors trying to protect profits after a really healthy run off the lows in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/middleeast/gaza-rain-floods-camps-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00-05:00","title":"Heavy Rainfall Floods Camps of Displaced Palestinians in Gaza","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rainfall in Gaza has caused widespread flooding in tents housing displaced Palestinians, who have been living in damaged, worn-out shelters for over two years due to Israeli military attacks.

3:21 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Displaced Palestinians in Gaza woke up Friday morning to inches of water flooding their tents, after heavy rainfall overnight left their shelters and belongings soaked with no way to dry them out.\n \n\n   \n  Officials in Gaza have received “hundreds of pleas for help,” Mahmoud Basal, the spokesperson for Gaza Civil Defense, told journalists, “but the resources are nonexistent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Entire shelter centers have seen water levels rise to more than 10 centimeters (3.94 inches). Mattresses are soaked, blankets are drenched and there are no options left — because every option has been destroyed by Israel,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Displaced Palestinians in Gaza City told CNN that the tents people were staying in were worn out, with some collapsing under the weight of the rain.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been flooded by the rain, us and our little children,” Raed Al-Alayan said. “Our tents were flooded.

Americans again support due process \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:08 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump began rapidly deporting migrants earlier this year to a brutal Salvadoran prison – including  some wrongfully so  – without due process, Democrats were  somewhat wary of pushing back .\n \n\n   \n  Yes, the move appeared illegal and highly problematic. But didn’t Americans just want undocumented immigrants deported? By standing up for due process, didn’t Democrats risk looking like they were siding with people in the country illegally – or even alleged gang members?\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turned out Americans could separate those two things in their minds. In large part because of the heavy-handedness of his deportations, Trump’s immigration agenda has suffered a series of defeats in court and  fallen out of favor  with the public.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reducing the number of illegal border-crossings to  record lows , Trump is somehow  underwater on immigration  polling.\n \n\n   \n  We could now be seeing a similar dynamic playing out with Trump’s  legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats  in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out these strikes without a legal process or offering public evidence of its justifications. The administration has likened the fight against drug-traffickers to a literal war and  said that allows it  to use war-like powers.\n \n\n   \n  Despite carrying out these strikes for more than two months and  killing 80 people now , we hadn’t had a good read on public opinion – until now. And it turns out, much like with the rapid deportations, the American public has real concerns.\n \n\n   \n  A new  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released Friday found Americans oppose such strikes by a wide margin, 51%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  The question asked whether people supported “authorizing the US military to kill suspected drug traffickers outside of the US without judicial process.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents opposed this 53%-22%. About twice as many Americans overall strongly opposed it (34%) as strongly supported it (15%). And even 27% of Republicans opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  Those are the kinds of numbers that would seem to suggest real political danger for Trump – and might embolden Democrats or other critics to start speaking out a little more forcefully.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the extraordinary nature of these strikes and major legal questions hanging over them, those critics thus far have been relatively quiet. And they certainly haven’t sought to elevate this issue to a top priority.\n \n\n   \n  We do have the likes of libertarian Republican Sen. Rand Paul speaking out pretty forcefully. Paul has called the strikes “extrajudicial killings.” He and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with nearly all Senate Democrats last month to rein in Trump’s authority on the boat strikes, although the measure ultimately did not pass.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawmakers have agitated for more briefings from the administration, which hasn’t publicly offered a legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s clear Democrats have decided to treat the issue somewhat gently, perhaps fearing they will look like they’re standing up for drug-traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, even  expressed confidence in the underlying intelligence . Warner suggested that, whatever other concerns people have about the strikes – and he expressed worries himself about the administration’s transparency – they shouldn’t be too concerned about them hitting innocent people.\n \n\n   \n  But just days later, the Associated Press reported that some who were killed in the strikes appear to have been  small-time criminals and amateurs , rather than the “narco-terrorists” the administration has said it’s targeting.\n \n\n   \n  This appears very much a live issue that will keep evolving. And the survey suggests those who would raise concerns have plenty of the public behind them.\n \n\n   \n  But actually, that shouldn’t be too surprising.\n \n\n   \n  Over and over again, polls have suggested the American people are actually quite interested in upholding the principle of due process – the principle that says, yes, these might be criminals, but we should probably make sure of that and have some accountability. And that even goes for noncitizens.\n \n\n   \n  A May  Public Religion Research Institute poll  showed Americans opposed the government deporting undocumented migrants to prisons in El Salvador and other countries “without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court,” 61%-37%.\n \n\n   \n  A June  poll from Vanderbilt University  showed support for deportations dropped from 51% to 39% when you add the qualifier that it would be done “without a formal hearing before a judge in an immigration court.”\n \n\n   \n  And a May  Reuters-Ipsos poll  showed Americans said 55%-41% that people suspected of being in the country illegally were entitled to due process. Independents agreed with that 63%-36%, and even 22% of Republicans agreed.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll see if these data – and perhaps the recent election results suggesting Trump is at a low point politically – inject lawmakers with more willingness to fight this battle.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, the downside of not speaking out more forcefully also appears to be coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Just this week, a report from human rights groups alleged that dozens of Venezuelans who were sent to the El Salvador prison were  subjected to torture  and other serious abuses like sexual violence. The report also echoed previous reporting that, contrary to the administration’s claims, there is little evidence many of these migrants were the hardened criminals or gang members the administration said they were.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could understand why Americans might be skeptical of not just imprisoning people without due process, but killing them.\n \n\n   \n  And it seems they are.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/walmart-doug-mcmillon-customers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:27:00-05:00","title":"How Walmart’s CEO Made It the Store for Literally Everyone","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug McMillon transformed Walmart from a struggling discount retailer into a dominant, inclusive, and technologically advanced retail giant during his tenure as CEO from 2014 to 2025.

The company’s stock recently hit all-time highs. Sales are surging, even as rivals such as Target, Home Depot and others slump. And Walmart raised wages and expanded benefits, becoming a business school  case study  on employee retention.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that is thanks to McMillon, who announced Friday that he’s  retiring  soon as CEO. He oversaw Walmart’s transformation from a brick-and-mortar discount superstore that largely appealed to lower-income Americans to an everything store, everywhere for everyone.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon, a Walmart lifer who took the top job at 47 as the company’s youngest CEO since founder Sam Walton, reinvented Walmart by threading one of the thinnest needles in retail: reaching new shoppers online while retaining old customers in stores. Walmart under McMillon used its unparalleled size to press suppliers into keeping prices ultra-low, all while adding new higher-end brands and growing online to attract a wealthier clientele.\n \n\n   \n  And McMillon accomplished this pivot while navigating contentious political and social issues in America that have engulfed many companies, such as Target and Bud Light.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon’s successor, veteran Walmart leader John Furner, will have to handle these challenges, as well as pressure from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and an uncertain future of shopping with AI.  Walmart  recently said it’s partnering with OpenAI to let users browse and make purchases directly through chatbot ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n    Walmart’s transformation\n \n\n   \n  Low and middle-income shoppers historically formed the customer base of Walmart’s superstores in rural and suburban America.\n \n\n   \n  But Walmart has increasingly drawn higher-income customers in recent years. Shoppers making more than $100,000 a year have  fueled  Walmart’s growth in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart’s grocery business has underpinned its success. More than half of Walmart’s sales come from groceries, and the company has used its size and scale to muscle down prices and  invest  in improving its meat and produce aisles. That has benefitted Walmart throughout McMillon’s tenure, particularly during the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent America searching for value that Walmart could help deliver.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Walmart under McMillon has built a strong e-commerce business to compete with Amazon and draw shoppers online. It has added the option to buy online and pick up in store to thousands of its locations and Walmart+, its same-day grocery delivery membership.\n \n\n   \n  Although Amazon leads e-commerce sales in the United States by a wide margin, accounting for 40.6% of sales,  Walmart comes in second  with 9.4%, according to market research firm eMarketer.\n \n\n   \n  “The most notable change during McMillon’s tenure has been Walmart’s evolution into a major e-commerce company,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n    Political culture wars\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also has deftly steered Walmart through political culture wars on guns, LGBTQ rights, immigration, the Confederate flag and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart, historically a conservative company based in deep-red Arkansas, appeals to a wide swath of America.\n \n\n   \n  It has worked carefully to stake out positions in the political middle to avoid offending customers and employees, and taken a slow, gradual approach to changing policies such as  gun and ammunition  sales. Dan Bartlett, the former communications director for President George W. Bush, has helped shape Walmart’s do-no-harm public affairs strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “Politics moves around,” McMillon  said  in a 2017 interview. “We are on our 11th administration, since Walmart was born. There will be a 12th. There will be a 13th.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/banksy-girl-with-balloon-theft-man-jailed-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00-05:00","title":"Man jailed for stealing Banksy’s ‘Girl with Balloon’ print in smash-and-grab London robbery","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 49-year-old man, Larry Fraser, was sentenced to 13 months in prison for stealing a signed 2004 print of Banksy’s iconic 'Girl with Balloon' artwork from the Grove Gallery in Fitzrovia, London, in a smash-and-grab robbery in September 2025.

Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don’t wanna be the only country that doesn’t test.”\n \n\n   \n  At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there’s not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn’t involve blowing anything up, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  The source said officials hoped it would give the president the opportunity to align himself with NNSA’s approach.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has the authority to order the tests anyway if he doesn’t agree with the nuclear experts.\n \n\n   \n  An NNSA spokesperson declined to comment. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mere minutes before he was due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea last month, Trump took to Truth Social to say that he had directed the “Department of War” to “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Inside the NNSA, Trump’s initial October suggestion was met with confusion, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody saw this coming,” one of them said.\n \n\n   \n  Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, told Fox News  earlier this month  that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The official argued the president became fixated on the idea while on his trip to Asia, telling CNN that some foreign leaders brought the issue up to Trump directly while he was abroad.  \n \n\n   \n  Another   administration official argued that they viewed the president’s comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s comments haven’t changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments.\n \n\n   \n  NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing.\n \n\n   \n  “If they wanted to just make the ground shake, you could probably do that sooner, but there wouldn’t be a purpose to the test beyond political signaling,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  There is also the matter of legacy cleanup of nuclear waste due to decades of nuclear testing in Nevada. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer.\n \n\n   \n  There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear   tests — something it says  it is not currently doing  — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe.\n \n\n   \n  Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China’s nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump’s first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet. That’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00Z","title":"The government is back open.

Here’s what that means for economic data \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:54 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US government has reopened following its longest-ever shutdown, setting the stage for the eventual release of the gold-standard federal data that is crucial in analyzing the health and trajectory of the nation’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Data nerds  (and government officials,  and Federal Reserve policymakers , and business owners, and, well,  everyone else for that matter ),  rejoice!\n \n\n   \n  Starting next week, the backlog of federal data will start flowing, and the long-awaited September jobs report (originally due out October 3) will publish Thursday, November 20, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been like flying in fog without any instrumentation,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  However, expect some choppiness when the air starts to clear.\n \n\n   \n  The very nature of the 43-day shutdown has created an unprecedented situation: Some datapoints were not gathered when they typically should have been, increasing the potential for big holes in what’s expected to be already messy data.\n \n\n   \n    What major economic reports are outstanding?\n \n\n   \n  Since the government was dark for the entirety of October and the first dozen days of November, several reports that included data collected in September and scheduled to be released in the ensuing weeks were not delivered ( with the exception of the Consumer Price Index ), nor was data collected for October (we’ll get to that here shortly).\n \n\n   \n  Other major reports in the wings – likely in various stages of completion – include September data on wholesale inflation, import and export prices, quarterly employment costs, annual consumer expenditures, retail sales, gross domestic product and consumer spending.\n \n\n   \n    When will they be released?\n \n\n   \n  That remains to be seen.\n \n\n   \n  The leading statistical agencies are in the process of updating their schedules for economic releases (a calendar set in place more than a year ago).\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s not as simple as plugging reports into different dates. Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index ,  which in turn feeds in to GDP.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis – the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies – announced it is “working to update its schedule of economic releases” and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA’s indicators.\n \n\n   \n  Early Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers’ shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Each economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n \n\n   \n  Still, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritize  Principal Federal Economic Indicators , which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover  Survey , for example, is not).\n \n\n   \n    Will we ever see the October jobs report?\n \n\n   \n  As it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a “lost” month of data – or close to it.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, the nation’s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended – disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it’s bound to be unreliable,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “I think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.”\n \n\n   \n  The household survey is what’s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate ,  and since that wasn’t conducted in October, “we’re going to get half the employment report,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett  said on Thursday . “We’ll get the jobs part, but we won’t get the unemployment rate.”\n \n\n   \n  The lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn’t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembled   using the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC in a note Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    October inflation data likely to be quite opaque\n \n\n   \n  The  visibility on inflation  data for October will be “particularly bad,” Reid noted.\n \n\n   \n  Two-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.\n \n\n   \n  That will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,” he said. “Absent the CPI and PPI reports, it’s hard to gauge inflation’s trajectory.”\n \n\n   \n  And if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a “serious data quality issue,” as it would likely lean more heavily on  imputation , a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.\n \n\n   \n  “But we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there’s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,” EY-Parthenon’s Daco told CNN. “So, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.”\n \n\n   \n    What about November data?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month’s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC’s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.\n \n\n   \n  “BLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it’s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,” she said, referencing the Trump administration’s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while it’s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it’s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,” she said. “I would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can’t run the October [household survey] again.”\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it’s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.\n \n\n   \n    We might not be back on track until 2026\n \n\n   \n  “Noisy” reports aren’t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).\n \n\n   \n  Entering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain of  just 12,000 jobs  – a far cry from September’s 223,000-job gain.\n \n\n   \n  It was also a one-time blip.\n \n\n   \n  After striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showed  a surge of 227,000 jobs gained .\n \n\n   \n  When the October 2025 jobs report is released, it’s expected to show significant job losses – perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC’s Reid estimates – largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  And, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month – the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment – the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown gummed up the nation’s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.\n \n\n   \n  “It’ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “So, there’s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we’re going to get until early winter 2026.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street is bracing for impact\n \n\n   \n  The privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  “If they hit the mark, and that’s what they show, then no harm, no foul,” he said. “If, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect – either on the upside on the downside – then that may call into question the Fed policy that’s been done since the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  US stocks had  their worst day in a month  Thursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks’ worth of data set to be released in short order.\n \n\n   \n  “I say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,” economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN’s Matt Egan. “When the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-student-murders-restitution","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Convicted killer Bryan Kohberger must reimburse families for their daughters’ urns","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty in June 2025 to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students—Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Maddie Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves—has been ordered by Idaho state judge Steven Hippler to reimburse the families of Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen for the cost of their urns, approximately $3,000.

November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Bryan Kohberger  must pay for the urns of two of the University of Idaho students he killed, an Idaho state judge ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s ruling comes after prosecutors asked the judge at a hearing last month to require the convicted killer to pay about $3,000 to reimburse the families of  Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen  for the urns carrying their ashes.\n \n\n   \n  Kohberger, who was set to go to trial in the summer, struck a deal with prosecutors in June that allowed him to escape the death penalty if he  pleaded guilty to the November 2022 murders  of Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Mogen and Goncalves.\n \n\n   \n  Kohberger’s attorneys argued he does not have the money to pay the additional restitution to the families, let alone the already-agreed-upon more than $30,000 in restitution   required through his plea agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Steven Hippler said in a written ruling that Kohberger can raise the money through donations or a job in prison to cover the additional funeral costs.\n \n\n   \n  The judge noted Kohberger amassed nearly $29,000 from several hundred donations since his arrest in a case that drew national attention with a cross-country manhunt following the fatal, nighttime stabbings that stunned a college town. Kohberger’s defense team has said most of the money came from his family members paying to communicate with him in jail and public donations have slowed since he pleaded guilty to the killings.\n \n\n   \n  “While these funds may no longer be available to Defendant, it is foreseeable he will continue to receive donations in the future, particularly given that much of the donated amounts came from his family,” Hippler wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, there is no reason Defendant cannot secure prison employment for remuneration. Given his limited needs in prison and his youth, it is foreseeable that through employment and donations, Defendant may receive sufficient amounts over his life to at least come close to meeting his financial restitution obligations.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/media/telegraph-uk-redbird-sale-collapse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00-05:00","title":"The Telegraph sale collapses as US private equity firm drops its bid for the UK newspaper","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"RedBird Capital Partners has withdrawn its £500 million bid for The Telegraph Media Group, a major British right-leaning newspaper founded in 1855, ending a two-year ownership saga.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  RedBird Capital withdrew its £500 million bid for the Telegraph Media Group on Friday, leaving the fate of the major British publisher unclear.\n \n\n   \n  “RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group,” a representative for private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners told CNN. “We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and will work hard to secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers.”\n \n\n   \n  RedBird’s decision not to pursue The Telegraph throws a wrench in the outlet’s bid to grow its business in the United States, even as its rivals — including the Daily Mail, the BBC and The Guardian — have expanded in North America over the last few years.\n \n\n   \n  The reversal comes months after RedBird announced in May that  it had reached an in-principle agreement  to acquire The Telegraph Media Group for roughly $657 million. At the time, that deal seemed to mark the end of the media company’s two-year saga   to find new ownership.\n \n\n   \n  Under the deal, RedBird was to become the sole controlling owner of The Telegraph, the right-leaning British newspaper founded in 1855. The private equity firm was set to invest in The Telegraph’s digital operation in a bid to expand the outlet’s foothold in the US and grow subscriptions overall.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph’s sale was long stymied by the British government’s restrictions on foreign government investments in media ownership, which capped foreign state-owned investments into a publisher at 15%.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird, with the help of International Media Investments (IMI) — an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed   a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family — helped the Barclay family regain control of The Telegraph in December 2023, but the British government barred the transfer of ownership.\n \n\n   \n  The May 2025 deal would have allowed IMI to retain a 15% investment, meeting that limit. However, The Telegraph’s own journalists have  questioned RedBird’s ties to China . In August, a coalition of human rights and freedom of expression organisations raised similar concerns in  an open letter  to Britain’s secretary of state for culture, media and sport.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird has denied the alleged ties to Beijing. IMI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with RedBird out of the picture, the right-leaning media empire’s future returns to a state of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “Our immediate priority is to minimise disruption to the business and work with all stakeholders, including DCMS, towards a solution,” a spokesperson for   Telegraph Media Group Holdings   told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:31:00-05:00","title":"School shootings in the US: Fast facts","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 14, 2025, the United States has experienced 68 school shootings — 39 on college campuses and 29 on K–12 school grounds — resulting in 26 deaths and over 100 injuries.

Maxwell is serving time have been terminated, one of Maxwell’s lawyers said Friday, after a whistleblower this week released to Rep. Jamie Raskin alleged correspondence between Maxwell and her lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Leah Saffian, a California-based attorney who has long-represented Maxwell, said in  a statement : “The release to the media by Congressman Raskin (Dem., Maryland), of Ms. Maxwell’s privileged client-attorney email correspondence with me is as improper as it is a denial of justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Saffian added that employees at the prison have been met with “appropriate consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have been terminated for improper, unauthorized access to the email system used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to allow inmates to communicate with the outside world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Bryan prison, Bureau of Prisons and the Justice Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,  released  what he said was information about Maxwell’s life inside the Bryan prison — including  special privileges  being afforded to the late-Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman — that was shared with Raskin by a whistleblower.\n \n\n   \n  The whistleblower also told Raskin that Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, is in the process of preparing to file an application for commutation. According to an email that the whistleblower shared with the committee, Maxwell wrote to Saffian in early October that she planned to send materials “through the warden.”\n \n\n   \n  House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Friday defended how they received and released the information and disputed that the correspondence was privileged.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Judiciary Committee Minority’s letter was based on a range of documents and information shared with Committee staff by a whistleblower. None of the documents shared with the Committee from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) TRULINCS system was subject to the attorney client privilege,” a House Judiciary Democratic spokeswoman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The spokeswoman pointed out that individuals have to accept a disclaimer that their activity will be monitored once logging into the prison’s systems. She said the disclaimer makes clear that DOJ may monitor the system and that users must consent to such monitoring and have no expectation that communications will stay private.\n \n\n   \n  Pertaining to attorney client privilege specifically, the Judiciary spokeswoman said the disclaimer includes this or similar language: “I understand and consent that this provision applies to electronic messages both to and from my attorney or other legal representative, and that such electronic messages will not be treated as privileged communications, and that I have alternative methods of conducting privileged legal communication.”\n \n\n   \n  Raskin offered no description of the whistleblower — a typical practice meant to protect the person’s identity. The Democratic spokeswoman added the committee “won’t comment on any information that could identify whistleblowers, including whistleblowers’ employment status” and decried “any effort by BOP to intimidate, silence, or retaliate against anyone” who shared information.\n \n\n   \n  In her Friday statement, Saffian also wrote: “Contrary to Rep. Raskin’s assertion, Ms. Maxwell has not requested a commutation — or made a Pardon — application to the second Trump Administration. Prior to any such application a Prisoner needs to demonstrate that all possible avenues of appeal have been exhausted.”\n \n\n   \n  (Raskin did not say Maxwell had requested a commutation or pardon application; he said Maxwell was in the process of working on a commutation application.)\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-election-interference-case-continues-georgia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Fani Willis’ Georgia election interference case against Trump will carry on with new prosecutor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high-profile federal and state prosecution in Georgia against Donald Trump and several allies for allegedly conspiring to alter the 2020 election results has transitioned from Fani Willis to new prosecutor Peter Skandalakis, who took over after being unable to find another willing prosecutor. The case began in August 2023 with a sweeping RICO indictment, citing Trump’s January 2021 phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. However, the prosecution faced significant legal challenges, including a disqualification of Willis due to her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, finalized in December 2024.

Donald J.

Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose their reasons for declining,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  A status/pretrial conference has been scheduled for December 1 with Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee, but the accused defendants are not required to attend.\n \n\n   \n  “The State should be prepared to announce whether it intends to seek a superseding indictment,” McAfee wrote in Friday’s notice calling for the conference.\n \n\n   \n  Skandalakis said he just recently received the investigative file from Willis’ office, including 101 boxes of documents delivered to him on October 29 and an eight-terabyte hard drive just over a week ago on November 6. Willis’ office declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  “With Judge McAfee’s deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case. This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed,” Skandalakis wrote on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Michael J. Moore, former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is skeptical the case will move ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “If the history between the Trump cases and Mr. Skandalakis foretells the future, these cases are dead on arrival,” he said. Moore also said he expects to see a recitation of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision as a basis for declining and dismissal, and is not surprised that no other prosecutor stepped forward. Moore referred to the cases as “overcharged” by using RICO.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a thankless job, akin to being invited to the center ring at the circus and then told that your job was to clean up after the elephants,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  The  historic state racketeering charges  were filed on August 14, 2023, by Willis, an elected Democrat who launched a lengthy investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in the Georgia election in early 2021. The investigation began shortly after a  January phone call  became public in which Trump pressured Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” the votes necessary for him to win the state in the Presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end. We remain confident that a fair and impartial review will lead to a dismissal of the case against President Trump,” Trump’s lead Georgia attorney Steve Sadow told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile case by the Fulton County prosecutor peaked in dramatic fashion when Trump surrendered in the Atlanta jail for a little over 20 minutes in August 2023, where he was forced to provide his mug shot for the first time. The case was seen as the most likely of the various criminal charges surrounding Trump to go to trial because it was a state case handled by a local Georgia prosecutor, rather than federal charges that could be pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was charged alongside 18 co-defendants on sweeping charges using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the state law commonly  referred to as RICO , similar to the federal version of the statute that was famously used to target criminal enterprises like the mafia.\n \n\n   \n  After a long-running investigation, Willis accused Trump and his allies of breaking several laws by participating in a conspiracy to unlawfully change the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n \n\n   \n    Several Trump allies involved in case\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the president, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was the highest-ranking official charged, along with former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who reached an agreement with two Georgia election officials this year to  settle a nearly $150 million defamation lawsuit.  \n \n\n   \n  Trump and his accused co-defendants “joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome” of the election, prosecutors alleged in the indictment, which said they “unlawfully conspired and endeavored to conduct and participate in criminal enterprise” after Trump lost the election in Georgia to Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  Sadow, Trump’s lead Georgia defense attorney on the case, vigorously maintained his client’s innocence during the ongoing legal process, along with attorneys who represented many of the co-defendants also charged in the unique racketeering conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants vehemently denied any wrongdoing, some arguing they were simply trying to rectify what they believed were serious irregularities that tainted the 2020 election results.\n \n\n   \n  Four of the 19 defendants in Willis’ case, including three attorneys directly involved in Trump’s bid to overturn the election results in the Peach State, accepted plea deals, in some cases pleading guilty to felony charges in exchange for more lenient sentencing recommendations.\n \n\n   \n  Thirty  “unindicted co-conspirators”  were also named in the high-profile case — a freight train that was barreling down the tracks simultaneously as Trump was campaigning for his second run at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Then in a  wild unexpected twist  in early 2024, Michael Roman, a campaign official for Trump in 2020, filed a motion that eventually got Willis disqualified from prosecuting the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help in the investigation. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, after Willis’ dramatic televised testimony put her personal life in the spotlight, Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee found that there was not enough evidence to firmly prove that Willis financially benefited from the relationship, and allowed Willis to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did.\n \n\n   \n  However, the legal proceedings against Trump and several co-defendants were officially paused in June 2024 when a Georgia appeals court reviewed potential misconduct by Willis.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, the appeals court officially disqualified Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Then the final dagger for Willis came in September, when  The Georgia Supreme Court declined  to hear an appeal from the Fulton County district attorney on  her removal .\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/sweden-bus-crash-fatalities-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:37:00-05:00","title":"Several people killed in bus crash in Stockholm, police say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus crash in central Stockholm, Sweden, on Friday, November 14, 2025, resulted in six casualties, with no passengers on the bus at the time.

12:03 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  About 100 Indigenous  protesters  blocked the main entrance to the  United Nations climate conference  on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon for 90 minutes on Friday in a peaceful standoff that ended after a lengthy discussion with the climate talks president, who cradled a protester’s baby during the talks.\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian military personnel kept demonstrators from entering the site hosting  COP30 meetings in Belem , but there appeared to be no physical altercations. The protesters, most in traditional Indigenous garb, formed a human chain around the entrance to block people from entering as the day’s meetings began. Other groups of activists formed a secondary chain around them.\n \n\n   \n  “No one enters, no one leaves,” was one of the main chants of the demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  It was the second time in four days that protesters disrupted climate talks that organizers have promoted as empowering and celebrating native peoples.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the Munduruku Indigenous group led the demonstration that blocked the main entrance, demanding a meeting with Brazilian President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva .\n \n\n   \n  “President Lula, we are here in front of COP because we want you to listen to us. We refuse to be sacrificed for agribusiness,’’ protesters said in a written statement in Portuguese released by the Munduruku Ipereg Ayu Movement. “Our forest is not for sale. We are the ones who protect the climate, and the Amazon cannot continue to be destroyed to enrich large corporations.”\n \n\n   \n  Munduruku leaders had a series of demands for Brazil. They included revoking plans for commercial development of rivers, canceling a grain railway project that has raised fears of deforestation and clearer demarcations of Indigenous territories. They also want a rejection of deforestation carbon credits.\n \n\n   \n  During the 90 minutes of blockage, conference participants were rerouted and delegates entered the venue through another door. U.N. staff rushed to move metal detectors to the side entrance as hundreds of people formed long lines. The protest at the front of the venue began at around 7:30 a.m., with the main entrance blocked about 30 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  Conference president André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, met with the group as they blocked the entrance.

Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A scientist in  Japan  has developed a technique that uses brain scans and artificial intelligence to turn a person’s mental images into accurate, descriptive sentences.\n \n\n   \n  While there has been progress in using scans of brain activity to  translate the words we think  into text, turning our complex mental images into language has proved challenging, according to Tomoyasu Horikawa, author of a study published November 5 in the journal  Science Advances .\n \n\n   \n  However, Horikawa’s   new method, known as “mind-captioning,” works by using AI to generate descriptive text that mirrors information in the brain about visual details such as ob﻿jects, places, actions and events, as well as the relationships between them.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa, a researcher at telecommunication company NTT’s Communication Science Laboratories just outside Tokyo, began by analyzing the brain acti﻿vity of four men and two women, native Japanese speakers between 22 and 37 years old, scanning their brains as they watched video clips. The participants viewed 2,180 videos without sound that were seconds long and varied in content among objects, scenes and actions.\n \n\n   \n  Large language models — generative AI systems trained on large datasets —   took   captions of the video clips and turned those captions into sequences of numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa trained separate, simpler AI models, known as “decoders,” to match the scanned brain activity related to the video clips to the numerical sequences.\n \n\n   \n  He then used   the decoders to interpret the study participants’ brain activity while   they watched or recalled videos that the AI had not encountered during the training process.   Another algorithm was created to progressively generate word sequences that best matched the decoded brain activity.\n \n\n   \n  As the AI learned from the data, the descriptive text tool   became better and better at using the brain scans to describe the videos the participants had watched.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just one additional step forward in the direction of what, in my view, we can legitimately call brain-reading or mind-reading,” Marcello Ienca, a professor of the ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich in Germany and president-elect of the International Neuroethics Society, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n    Potential for ‘profound’ health interventions\n \n\n   \n  The AI model generated text in English, even though the participants were not native English speakers.\n \n\n   \n  The method can create comprehensive descriptions of visual content, even without using the activity in language-related regions of the brain, or the “language network,” Horikawa said, “indicating that this method can be used even when someone has damage around that language network.”\n \n\n   \n  The technology could potentially be used to assist people with aphasia, who struggle with language expression due to damage around the language network; or  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects speech, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study paves the way for some profound interventions for people who have difficulty communicating, including non-verbal autistic people,” said psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, a lecturer at Barnard College in New York who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  However, “we have to use it carefully and make sure we aren’t being invasive and that everyone consents to it,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The ultimate privacy challenge’\n \n\n   \n  The success of this method — which could be applied to decode the thoughts of infants or animals, or the content of dreams — “raises ethical concerns” regarding privacy, with the possibility of disclosing an individual’s private thoughts before they have verbalized them, the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  If in the future this technology is used by consumers beyond biomedical purposes, “I think this is the ultimate privacy challenge,” Ienca said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that there are many companies, such as  Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant startup , that are making public claims about soon developing neural implants for the general population.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get there, then we need to have very, very strict rules when it comes to granting access to people’s minds and brains,” Ienca said, highlighting that our brains include “sensitive information” such as “signatures of early dementia and psychiatric disorders and depression.”\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the journal  Cell  in August suggested that the “leakage” of private inner thoughts during decoding could be prevented by a mechanism in which the user thinks of a particular keyword to unlock the decoding tool only when intended.\n \n\n   \n  The “neuroscience is moving fast and the assistive potential is huge — but mental privacy and freedom of thought protections can’t wait,” said social scientist Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, an assistant professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and a director of European Affairs at the Neurorights Foundation in New York.\n \n\n   \n  “We should treat neural data as sensitive by default, require explicit purpose-limited consent, and prioritize on-device processing with user-controlled ‘unlock’ mechanisms. Reliance on AI introduces additional regulatory and cybersecurity challenges and underscores the need for complementary, AI-specific legal framework,” Szoszkiewicz, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, Horikawa noted that the method used in his study requires a large amount of data collection, with the cooperation of active participants. So, while the technology is useful for neuroscientific research, it is “not so accurate for practical use,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the videos used in the study included typical scenes of, for example, a dog biting a man, but not more unusual scenes — say, a man biting a dog. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the technique could be used to capture less predictable mental images.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, “while some people may worry that this technology poses serious risk to mental privacy,” in reality, “the current approach cannot easily read a person’s private thoughts,” Horikawa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/china/shenzhou-20-crew-return-earth-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Chinese astronauts arrive home after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou-20 mission returned to Earth more than a week late due to a suspected impact from space debris that cracked the return capsule’s window.

after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday more than a week later than their scheduled arrival, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris strike left their spaceship with a cracked window.\n \n\n   \n  The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China’s Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they’d even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.\n \n\n   \n  But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).\n \n\n   \n  Medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  “The path of humanity’s exploration of space is not smooth,” Chen Dong, one of the astronauts, told journalists in front of the capsule. “It is full of difficulties and challenges, and that is also why we choose to walk this path.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very proud that we successfully completed the mission…We have finally made it home safely.”\n \n\n   \n  The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China’s Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.\n \n\n   \n  Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a  nine-hour sortie , and it’s about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.\n \n\n   \n  The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.\n \n\n   \n  The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed  bans on Chinese citizens  with US visas participating in NASA programs.\n \n\n   \n  The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts who have been left in limbo. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, for example, spent 371 days on the ISS — a US record — after a tiny piece of space debris struck his Russian Soyuz spacecraft and forced a monthslong extension to his trip. Roscosmos launched a replacement capsule that eventually carried Rubio and cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams saw their weeklong stay on the International Space Station stretch into a more than nine-month mission after their spacecraft malfunctioned during a test flight. They joined the ISS expedition crew   and eventually  returned home  in March.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/style/katseye-creative-director-humberto-leon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00.000-05:00","title":"Katseye: The Blueprint for a Modern Girl Group","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Katseye, a multiracial girl group formed through the Netflix reality show 'Pop Star Academy', has emerged as a groundbreaking mainstream girl group by blending K-pop structure with global cultural diversity.

Humberto Leon is the mastermind behind their image \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:28 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two years ago, six young women — Sophia, Lara, Manon, Daniela, Megan and Yoonchae — went from relative obscurity to internet fame when the Netflix reality show, “Pop Star Academy,” turned them into the now-Grammy-nominated girl group Katseye.\n \n\n   \n  As their names were called out in the finale, the newly appointed members — who beat 120,000 other contestants vying for a spot — hugged and congratulated each other through sobs, each in matching gray blazer-skirt suits, styled with white shirts, knee-high socks and black shoes — mimicking the kind of attire worn by South Korean secondary students.\n \n\n   \n  The group is backed by Hybe Corporation, which brought K-pop to a global audience through mega artists like BTS, and Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record company and owner of Geffen Records. Together they sought to create the world’s first mainstream multiracial girl group modeled on  the traditional K-pop framework , which includes catchy melodies, synchronized dance moves and a strong emphasis on aesthetic appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Katseye’s members have   since stepped out in many head-turning looks, from the revealing red leather stage outfits worn in August for their Lollapalooza music festival performance, which drew record-breaking crowds, to the glitzy Dolce & Gabbana dresses worn for  their MTV VMAs red carpet debut  a month later. Earlier in the summer, they fronted  a viral campaign for Gap  while dancing   in low-rise denim to the 2003 Kelis song “Milkshake.” On other occasions, they’ve dipped into luxury brand archives and worn pieces from the likes of Prada, Hussein Chalayan and early 2000s Balenciaga designed by Nicolas Ghesquière. And as they embark on their first solo tour across North America — the tickets for which sold out in minutes — more eye-catching ensembles are sure to feature.\n \n\n   \n  The creative mastermind behind the band’s image is Humberto Leon, a former fashion entrepreneur and designer. Today, as Katseye’s creative director, Leon styles the members from head to toe, weighing in on every detail from the accessories to hair and makeup. In short, anything to do with their visual image falls under Leon’s purview.\n \n\n   \n  “There was this kind of feeling of tomboy meets rebellion,” Leon told CNN over a video call from Los Angeles, as he reflected on Katseye’s first appearance as a group. “The uniforms added a fun storytelling aspect.”\n \n\n   \n  School uniforms are a popular and recurring trope in pop culture (see a 16-year-old  Britney Spears in schoolgirl attire  in the music video for “Baby One More Time”). Several K-pop girl groups, including Girls’ Generation, Red Velvet and 2NE1, have also previously worn them, as they convey a youthful and fresh image. But Katseye’s look had subtle touches that pushed the common visual motif forward, according to Leon, whose subversive approach to fashion over a decades-long career has often appealed to hip audiences. “We wanted to differentiate,” he explained, “so all the jackets were actually boys’ blazers.”\n \n\n   \n    Bringing cultures together\n \n\n   \n  K-pop has gained significant mainstream traction over the years, but Katseye (which was trained using the K-pop methodology) is unlike many of the genre’s other bands. The group comprises multiple ethnicities: Sophia is from the Philippines; Yoonchae was born in South Korea; Manon was raised in Switzerland to Swiss-Italian and Ghanian parents; Daniela is Venezuelan-Cuban and Lara is of Indian descent, though both were born and raised in the US; and Megan is from Hawaii, born to a Singaporean-Chinese mother and Swedish-American father. Their songs are also sung almost entirely in English.\n \n\n   \n  Since Katseye’s official debut in 2024 with the EP “SIS (Soft is Strong)” and the viral breakthrough single “Touch,” which quickly landed on Spotify’s Top Hits playlist, the group has grown into one of pop’s most watched newcomers, adored for its diverse appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Leon shares a similarly multicultural upbringing. He currently resides in Eagle Rock, the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood where he was born and raised by a Peruvian father and Chinese mother, to whom he attributes his love of fashion. “My mom worked in a cafeteria by day, but in the evening, she would work on all these fun things, like selling cowboy hats to people, or in the ’80s she would sell fur coats at home, almost like the way people sell Tupperware,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She always encouraged me to be yourself and to clash, to not need things to be so perfect,” Leon added. “I took to heart a lot of that.”\n \n\n   \n  After working as a visual merchandiser for Gap and Burberry early in his career, Leon made his name in New York in the 2000s — he co-founded the now-shuttered Opening Ceremony (a once-cult shopping destination with stores in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo) and was formerly co-designer at Kenzo, a role he jointly held with Carol Lim, with whom he revitalized the label by injecting a youthful, streetwise sensibility that appealed to shoppers.\n \n\n   \n  “Opening Ceremony was the antithesis of everything I had ever done,” said Leon. “It was about celebrating young designers and going around the world and finding these gems and bringing them to one place and creating almost this town square where people can discover stuff. Some people would buy, some didn’t — but for us, it didn’t matter. It was about creating a community where people can come together.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon is among a wave of fashion insiders who in recent years have made the shift to music and entertainment. Cynthia Oh, for instance, worked in high-end retail for more than two decades before becoming the visual creative director at Hybe and, now, The Black Label — K-pop super-producer Teddy Park’s company, which represents Blackpink’s Rosé among others.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve always celebrated this idea of bringing culture together,” Leon continued. “And so, in many ways, Katseye is just a different version of that.”\n \n\n   \n    A new kind of girl power\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s return to Eagle Rock and subsequent decision to launch the Peruvian-Chinese restaurant Chifa, in 2022, was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. But it also led to his music industry crossover. “One day, this great punk rock girl group called  The Linda Lindas  came in. I was really inspired by them and said, ‘I would love to make a music video for you. Let’s do something fun.’” So, Leon worked with the band to create music videos for its 2022 album, “Growing Up,” which subsequently caught the eye of Hybe chairman Bang Si-hyuk and Interscope Geffen A&M chairman and CEO John Janick.\n \n\n   \n  “They approached me and asked if I would be interested in working on a global girl group,” said Leon. “The one thing I realized in all my other ventures I had done before is that there was this connection to storytelling and authenticity. When I was able to sum this up for myself, I felt like I could bring that same energy to other things,” he said. “The restaurant was the first thing that I started outside of fashion — yet a lot of people tell me it has a similar vibe to Opening Ceremony. It made me realize I was doing the right thing, and that I could bring this feeling to other cultures and artistic work.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s first interactions with Katseye involved “really getting to know them.” There have been “countless” girl groups, he said, rattling off a list of acts preceding them, such as the Spice Girls and Destiny’s Child, so it was crucial to figure out “the ideologies and virtues that these girls bring” and what made them   different. “The first thing I said to them was, ‘I want to hear about your background, how you grew up. I know you can dance, you can sing, but let’s hear about what you truly love and are inspired by,’ and with that, we were able to create a story that was genuine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We talk a lot about silhouettes, we talk about designers, but it goes beyond that. We make sure that their culture is around and that each girl, as a whole, is represented,” Leon continued, noting the bindi worn by Lara as an example. (The bindi — a decorative mark or sticker worn on the forehead, most commonly by women in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions — is often sported by Lara, who has not disclosed her religion but has spoken publicly about using it to reclaim and represent   the   South Asian identity she was teased for as a child.)\n \n\n   \n  That emphasis on representation also extends to Katseye’s music. The band’s latest EP, “Beautiful Chaos,” released in June, marks a bolder chapter, with tracks like “Gnarly” and “M.I.A” highlighting each member’s vocal range and increasingly defined personal identities. “Gabriela,” the second single in the EP, is “very different to most of the other songs in that it has a femininity to it,” explained Leon. “Daniela sings the Spanish part of the song. It has this Latin vibe that we wanted to make sure that we capture.” What remains crucial, across both their songs and style, is “that there is synergy amongst each other,” Leon said.\n \n\n   \n  As Katseye’s tour begins, just weeks after the band’s first Grammy nomination, Leon is remaining tightlipped about his stage outfits. “We like to keep things as a surprise,” he teased, but noted that maintaining a sense of relatability and individuality have remained top priorities.\n \n\n   \n  For Leon, Katseye is the living embodiment of girl power for a Gen Z audience that is   “hungry for authenticity and genuine brands that stand for something, or a voice that they can relate to,” he said. But the group, Leon hopes, isn’t just for young girls, but fans of all genders and ages. “I want people to see themselves in Katseye,” he said. “I want them to be excited that a group like Katseye exists.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/military-venezuela-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump Briefed This Week on Options for Military Operations in Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump was briefed on military options for Venezuela, including air strikes on government or drug trafficking targets, as part of a broader strategy under Operation Southern Spear.

\n  By Kevin Liptak, Zachary Cohen, Jim Sciutto, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was briefed this week on options for military operations inside Venezuela as he continues to mull a path forward in the country, four sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to decide on how to proceed, and he continues to weigh the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign. The president has previously voiced reservations about taking military action meant to oust Nicolas Maduro, concerned about whether it would prove effective.\n \n\n   \n  While Wednesday’s briefing included an updated set of options for the president to consider, it did not indicate that he’s closer to making a decision, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the briefing said the options were similar to those that have been discussed within the Pentagon, and some publicly reported, in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The target options – which United States Southern Command has stood up planning cells to develop – are part of an operation dubbed “SOUTHERN SPEAR,” according to a senior US official aware of the planning. They were presented by top officials on Trump’s national security team, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the operation on X Thursday night, though he did not reveal details.\n \n\n   \n  “Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Command had  previously announced  an operation called Operation Southern Spear in January. An announcement at the time said it would utilize “long-dwell robotic surface vessels, small robotic interceptor boats, and vertical take-off and landing robotic air vessels” to help with counternarcotics operations.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Southern Spear. The White House did not comment on the briefing. CBS News was first to report on the briefing.\n \n\n   \n   The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” arrived in the Caribbean this week amid a massive scale-up of US military resources.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including  air strikes  on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN had  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action at all. Administration officials told lawmakers last week that the US  didn’t have a legal justification  that would support attacks against any land targets – though it is possible they could generate one. And Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/ukraine-russia-assassination-attempt-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:37:00-05:00","title":"Ukraine attacks key Russian oil hub as deadly strikes pound Kyiv","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine launched a significant strike on Novorossiysk, a major Russian oil export terminal, using domestically produced long-range Neptune cruise missiles and UAVs, causing extensive infrastructure damage and igniting a major fire.

stepping down \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO for just over a decade, is retiring next year, the retailer announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon will be succeeded by John Furner on February 1, 2026. Furner is currently the CEO and president of Walmart’s US operations, the company’s largest business unit. Both executives have been with the company for several decades in various leadership roles.\n \n\n   \n  The transition comes amid a tumultuous time for retailers, as  tariffs  and sinking consumer sentiment has roiled the industry’s bottom lines. Yet  Walmart  under McMillon has overcome many of the issues that have plagued competitors – its supply-chain dominance and grocery prowess has allowed Walmart to offer rock-bottom prices on necessities, attracting customers across a wide range of income groups. The company reported in its most recent earnings call that its fastest-growing customer segment includes households who earn  more than $100,000 a year .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also oversaw the company’s transition to a major ecommerce competitor, offering a strong alternative to Amazon and a significant growth engine for Walmart. The company has grown its Walmart+ subscription business that serves as a kind of nascent rival to Amazon Prime.\n \n\n   \n  He was also previously the  chairman  of Business Roundtable, the most prominent group of nearly 200 chief executives representing corporate America’s interests in Washington, for a two-year term.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to expanding Walmart, he’s also made striking changes at the company. In 2019, Walmart stopped selling handgun ammunition, ammunition commonly used in military-style assault weapons and ask customers to stop openly carrying guns at stores after a mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas location left  22 people dead .\n \n\n   \n  He was also an  outspoken  critic of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, and he has frequently spoken out against President Donald Trump’s  tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  But McMillon also oversaw the unsuccessful $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an upmarket Amazon rival that didn’t pan out the way Walmart had expected. The business was ultimately shut down and integrated into the broader Walmart.com. McMillon’s push into upscale clothing, like Bonobos, also  hasn’t worked out .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon first began as a store associate and worked his way to top including stints at Sam’s Club and Walmart’s international operations. He helped harness Walmart ( WMT ) into being a true competitor to Amazon and its stock has grown 300% since he became CEO in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family and Board have stated many times that Doug was uniquely qualified to be CEO at the necessary time for Walmart,” said Greg Penner, Chairman of Walmart Inc., in a press release. “Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Furner, he’s been the CEO and President of Walmart US’ 4,600 stores since 2019 and also began as an hourly associate in 1993. In addition, he’s worked at Sam’s Club and Walmart China. The company credited his “associate development, digital innovation, and operational excellence.”\n \n\n   \n  Walmart said that McMillon remain on its board until next June and will be an adviser to Furner throughout fiscal year 2027. An announcement on Walmart’s US CEO replacement will be named soon.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/king-charles-iii-77th-birthday-photo-intl-scli-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"New photo released to mark King Charles III’s 77th birthday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III celebrated his 77th birthday with the release of a new photo taken at Sandringham Estate, where he is shown tending to a maple sapling, symbolizing the restoration of the estate’s gardens.

defamation claim \n       \n  By Catherine Nicholls, Christian Edwards, Billy Stockwell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:53 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC apologized to US President Donald Trump on Thursday over a documentary that Trump’s lawyers described as false and defamatory, seeking to defuse a row that has plunged the public broadcaster into its  worst crisis in years .\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson said that lawyers for the broadcaster had written to Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President (Donald) Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any BBC platforms while rejecting that it was defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s arguments as to why it believes it does not have a case to answer, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip not meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the October 2024 documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday. He is yet to respond to the BBC apology.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC had already apologized for an error of judgment in the documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, but not before it had ignited a scandal that saw the resignations of its director-general and head of news.\n \n\n   \n  In the documentary, Trump’s January 6 speech was edited to show him saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the US leader said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” with “fight like hell” coming 54 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Trump said the British broadcaster had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday,  the Telegraph newspaper  accused the BBC of similarly editing the same speech in a 2022 episode of the show Newsnight, again making it look like Trump was encouraging his followers to “fight like hell” in the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the broadcaster said that “the BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards,” adding that the matter “has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s board has been criticized for responding too slowly to the editing error, which was revealed in a leaked internal memo that has created a firestorm of criticism and allegations of systemic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Deborah Turness, the outgoing CEO of BBC News who resigned on Sunday, has said that while mistakes were made, “allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to BBC News staff following her resignation, Turness said that the backlash surrounding the Trump documentary had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC that the broadcaster was “right to apologize for what were serious mistakes.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked if she believed the BBC is “doomed” if it loses the public’s trust, the official said that the organization “is and remains the most trusted source of news in this country, and one of the top five most trusted sources of news all over the world.”\n \n\n   \n  When it makes mistakes, the BBC must be “willing and able to respond to that level of challenge and to put in place changes, because that trust is something that is essential, it’s vital, it’s precious, and it must be protected,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The British public broadcaster’s next steps are not immediately clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment when reached by CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/cost-of-living-affordability-plan-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00-05:00","title":"The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is revising his economic plan in response to growing public discontent over rising living costs and stagnant job growth.

But the realities of a persistent  affordability crisis , low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.\n \n\n   \n  Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.\n \n\n   \n  Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan A\n \n\n   \n  The original Trump economic plan was based on  three bold assumptions :\n \n\n   \n  For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.\n \n\n   \n  As it turns out, some parts didn’t work.\n \n\n   \n  Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans has  doubled over the past four years , according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recent  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan B\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new plan is emerging.\n \n\n   \n   Tariff dividends:  Trump last weekend floated the idea of  $2,000 tariff rebate checks , a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.\n \n\n   \n  Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,  exacerbating inflation .\n \n\n   \n   50-year mortgages:  Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a  50-year mortgage , which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowers  never actually own their homes . Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.\n \n\n   \n  All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security.\n \n\n   \n   Portable mortgages:  Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering a  portable mortgage , which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high.\n \n\n   \n  But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.\n \n\n   \n   Lowering some tariffs:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announce  lower tariffs on produce  that isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.\n \n\n   \n    Make America Affordable Again\n \n\n   \n  A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-called  K-shaped economy , in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasingly  live paycheck to paycheck. \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: He  claimed, falsely , that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treene  that Trump is getting more frequent economic briefings  and has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.\n \n\n   \n  And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/science/hitler-dna-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-05:00","title":"Researchers say they verified and sequenced Hitler’s DNA.

What they discovered is a controversial bombshell \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:52 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Researchers have analyzed a sample of DNA believed to belong to Adolf Hitler, which they say reveals the dictator of Nazi Germany had a genetic marker for a rare disorder that can delay puberty, according to a new documentary.\n \n\n   \n  The research, which took more than four years to complete, was led by geneticist Turi King, a professor at the UK’s University of Bath who is known for identifying the  remains of King Richard III . King said she verified that a piece of material taken from a couch in the bunker where Hitler shot himself in 1945 was soaked in the dictator’s blood by comparing a DNA sample recovered from the blood with a confirmed relative of Hitler’s.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to suggesting the possibility that Hitler had a hormone-disrupting congenital condition called  Kallmann syndrome , the documentary examined rumors that the dictator had Jewish ancestry and looked at whether he had a genetic predisposition to certain mental health conditions. Called “Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,” the documentary premieres Saturday on Channel 4 in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  However, the findings shared in the documentary haven’t been reviewed by other scientists in the field or published in a scientific journal, making it hard for experts not involved in the project to evaluate the validity of its assertions. King said that the analysis had been submitted to a “high-profile” journal and said she hopes the work will be published soon.\n \n\n   \n  The small patch of frayed fabric started its journey in 1945 in the hands of US Army Col. Roswell P. Rosengren, who was communications officer for Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower. When Rosengren was allowed into Hitler’s bunker by Soviet forces, he cut a swatch of material from a bloodstained couch, according to the documentary. The swatch stayed in Rosengren’s family before being put up for sale at auction in 2014 and purchased by the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t know what we were going to find,” King said. “It could have been the most boring genome on the planet, but it has been incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The most striking finding from the team’s analysis was that Hitler had a mutation on a gene called PROK2. Variants in this gene  are a cause of Kallmann syndrome  and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, King  said. In boys, these conditions   can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, they are characterized by low testosterone levels. You either don’t go through puberty or you go through a partial puberty … 5% of cases get associated with a  micropenis , ”    King said, referring to a small but normally structured penis.\n \n\n   \n    Clues in the historical record\n \n\n   \n  At the time of his death, Hitler was observed at the end of the sofa with a gun and blood splattered on the couch and the wall behind him, said Nicholas F. Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. He examined parts of the sofa, which is now in Russia, in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  “If the provenance of the sofa material used is confirmed to have come from the Bunker and from the settee that Hitler and  Eva Braun  died on, then the likelihood of the blood having come from Hitler is very good,” Bellantoni said by email.\n \n\n   \n  The new details that King put forth appear to align with the historical record, according to Alex Kay, an expert on Nazi Germany and senior lecturer at the Chair of War Studies at Germany’s University of Potsdam. Kay also appeared in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that a medical document from Hitler’s stay in prison after a failed coup known as the Munich  beer hall putsch  in 1923 suggested the dictator had right-side cryptorchidism — a condition in which a testicle fails to descend into the scrotum.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of Kallmann syndrome is, for me, personally, as a historian and as somebody who has spent more than 20 years researching the Nazis, a major finding,” Kay said. He added the information potentially explained Hitler’s lack of personal relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Kay and King said the findings also put to rest lingering rumors that Hitler had Jewish ancestry — speculation that stemmed from Hitler’s grandmother becoming pregnant while working in a Jewish household, according to the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Because the Y chromosome data analyzed in the research matched the DNA of Hitler’s male line relative, King said it’s not possible Hitler had Jewish ancestry. “If that was the case, we wouldn’t have got the DNA match with him,” King said. “That DNA match not only confirmed that this is Hitler’s DNA but also confirms that that story of human Jewish ancestry through his father is just simply not true.”\n \n\n   \n    The value of historical DNA\n \n\n   \n  King said she had some initial reservations about taking part in the documentary but decided to participate because she felt her expertise would   ensure that the analysis was scientifically rigorous. “This is also not just a documentary but an academic paper,” she said, adding she had no publication date to offer.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have previously used DNA to study well-known historical figures. Beethoven’s DNA, recovered from a lock of hair, revealed that the  composer had health issues . Archaeologists also widely use ancient DNA from human remains.\n \n\n   \n  However, without information on the quality of the genome, the raw data or how the analyses were done, it is not possible to assess the assertions made in the documentary, according to Pontus Skoglund, senior group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n \n\n   \n  “Stepping back, the scientific value of a media campaign such as this balanced against the possible stigmatization of individuals with these real diseases today can also be questioned,” Skoglund said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the researchers could have shared the findings with the scientific community on what’s known as a preprint server before a formal peer review and publication in an established journal.\n \n\n   \n  It’s plausible that historical DNA could be extracted from the piece of cloth, but there has to be good justification for studying the DNA from historical figures and a defined set of questions, said Tom Booth, Skoglund’s colleague and a bioarchaeologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “There are extensive historical records documenting the behaviour of Hitler in public and private,” Booth said via email. “(H)e is probably one of the most intensively studied figures in history, so I think it’s difficult to argue the DNA evidence adds much in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  “Even the Kallmann syndrome diagnosis might not be as straightforward as the headlines suggest. There can be a lot of variation in how it manifests physically, and while it is a plausible explanation for his undescended testicle, it doesn’t justify the amount of ‘micropenis’ in my newsfeed.” \n \n\n   \n    A ‘small, small puzzle piece’\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also said they calculated a polygenic risk score, which involves sifting through a person’s DNA to quantify disease risk. Their findings suggested that Hitler had an increased genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.\n \n\n   \n  However, polygenic risk score is a tool used today for research purposes — it’s not diagnostic and doesn’t mean that Hitler necessarily had these conditions, said Ditte Demontis, a professor in psychiatric genetics at Denmark’s Aarhus University, who was involved in the research and appears in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  “Currently, we are at a state where polygenic risk scores for psychiatric conditions are only used in the context of research,” Demontis emphasized. “We can say something at a group level but not an individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Demontis compared Hitler’s polygenic risk score with those of 30,000 Danish people and found that if Hitler lived today “his score for schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder was actually higher than 99% of the individuals in the Danish population.” It is also rare to have a high polygenic risk score for all three conditions, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not diagnostic, and I also want to stress that the score absolutely by no means leads to any certain kinds of behavior or actions,” Demontis said.\n \n\n   \n  King agreed. “We are at great, great pain not to stigmatize people with these conditions, because, you know … it’s incredibly rare that   people with these conditions go on to commit violent acts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And the other thing is that Hitler did not act alone, he had hundreds and thousands of people who helped him,” King noted. “They’re not all going to have the same genetic makeup as him. His genetics is just a small, small puzzle piece.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/republicans-scramble-health-care-obamacare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Republicans scramble for health care plan, as Democrats eye midterm battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire in weeks, Republicans are scrambling to develop a health care plan to prevent a surge in premiums and avoid political backlash during the 2027 midterm elections.

midterm battle \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans in Washington successfully  defused the 43-day government shutdown  without surrendering to Democrats’ demands to spend billions more to offset spiking health insurance costs.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire in just weeks – which would  more than double  the cost of premiums nationally for tens of millions of Americans. And it’s causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the White House, officials are accelerating efforts to put together a new health care plan that fulfills  President Donald Trump ’s desire to take another shot at overhauling Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  Those early discussions have sought to balance Trump’s demands against the broader Republican Party’s wariness of waging another politically disastrous health care war, four people familiar with the matter said. Officials are debating a limited package of conservative health care changes, including eliminating the enhanced ACA subsidies in favor of funneling money directly to Americans — potentially through an expansion of health savings accounts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, are closely watching the GOP’s plans, which they believe will never pass Congress – giving them a huge political boost and possibly delivering them control of the House in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of the GOP’s plans is fueling anxiety for Republicans like Rep. Jeff Van Drew, the outspoken populist from New Jersey who has repeatedly urged party leaders to give some relief for those Obamacare premiums or face voters’ wrath next November.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a whole bunch [of ideas] that are out there,” Van Drew said, ticking off proposals such as Trump’s idea to give money directly to consumers to buy plans. “The question is, can we get them done on time, to really not hurt people in the United States of America?”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another reason Van Drew is worrying. Time is running short and he said GOP leaders have been tight-lipped on their plans: “A lot of members haven’t seen any of this.”\n \n\n   \n  He isn’t the only one sounding the alarm. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — who has drawn the ire of Trump himself for her criticism of the party — has been repeatedly warning of a health care catastrophe of the GOP’s own making if Congress doesn’t act.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s my problem. Republicans have never fixed it,” Greene said of Obamacare in an interview with “The Sean Spicer Show.” She said Republicans need to act to make sure “the American people aren’t driving 80 miles per hour off a brick wall and hitting a financial crisis which is what’s actually happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the GOP’s leadership ranks,  there’s an acknowledgement  they need to do something on health care affordability. But those party leaders are also staunchly opposed to renewing those subsidies, which they insist simply funds insurance companies and props up a failed law.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, House GOP leaders are assembling their own slate of health care bills — though exactly which ones have yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pulling together the best ideas that we can, in the quickest fashion, to bring premiums down,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Wednesday night, the same day the House returned from a six-week recess during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House aides have similarly indicated that they will soon have a concrete plan, insisting that the administration plans to play a central role in directing the GOP’s health care strategy amid deepening concerns over Trump’s standing on the economy and affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to further expanding health savings accounts, officials have weighed a range of existing conservative policy ideas aimed at expanding patients’ health care options and lowering costs — including loosening certain Obamacare guardrails and giving states greater flexibility to customize their health insurance marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Yet many of those proposals have proven unpopular with voters in the past, and fall well short of Trump’s vow to “forget this Obamacare madness” altogether. And as the midterm outlook worsens for the GOP, some in the party still plan to push for a simpler compromise on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  There are at least a dozen House Republicans who do support temporarily extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies, many of them from battleground districts that will be key to GOP control of the chamber next year. Virginia Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans has been particularly vocal on the issue, drafting a bill to extend the subsidies for one year that’s gotten a dozen GOP cosponsors.\n \n\n   \n  Kiggans and her cosponsors are already working to plot a path forward: Staff of several of those members on the bill will meet Thursday to discuss next steps, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Another swing-seat Republican backing the bill, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday seeking bipartisan talks to work on a bill extending those Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But even some House moderates privately acknowledge that it’s unlikely any provision that upholds Obamacare can pass the GOP chamber. Even if the bill would win Democratic votes, GOP leaders know there is fierce resistance to any Obamacare bill and would refuse to put it on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also grown increasingly opposed to continuing the subsidies despite the political peril, with one of the people familiar with the matter characterizing the president as “on fire” over the issue. Though administration officials during the shutdown’s first weeks had weighed supporting a short-term extension that would phase out the subsidies over time, that idea has since appeared to lose steam, the people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent days has instead repeatedly disparaged the tax credits as a “disaster” and latched onto arguments made by conservative allies that they largely amount to a windfall for insurance companies.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jim Jordan, the influential House Judiciary chairman, for instance, entirely dismissed the idea of extending the subsidies when pressed by CNN if he could accept any plan that kept them in place.\n \n\n   \n  “If Obamacare was so wonderful, why do we need to keep extending the expanded subsidies?” the Ohio Republican said. ”This is an expansion of Obamacare.”\n \n\n   \n  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, too, argued that any extension of the subsidies would be simply a move to “prop up a failed Obamacare fund.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Affordable Care Act has failed miserably at being affordable. That is a broken model. We want to give people options that lower their premiums, not just shovel more money to insurance companies,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/immigration-california-revokes-commercial-drivers-licenses-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:33:00-04:00","title":"California revokes 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses for immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California has announced the revocation of 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants, citing that expiration dates exceeded the legal status of the drivers in the United States.

  \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:33 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the  drivers were legally allowed  to be in the US, state officials said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public’s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the US made an illegal U-turn and caused a  crash in Florid a that killed three people.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California’s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver’s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we’ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,” Duffy said, referring to the state’s governor. “This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person’s legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Newsom’s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver’s licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed.\n \n\n   \n  The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy revoked $40 million in  federal funding  because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state’s effort to comply.\n \n\n   \n  The new rules for commercial driver’s licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa.\n \n\n   \n  H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n \n\n   \n  Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn’t have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver’s work permit expired — sometimes years after.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said the state followed guidance it received from the US Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-decision-nears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Clock is ticking ahead of NCAA’s decision on proposed gambling rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As sports gambling becomes more widespread and legal in U.S. states, the NCAA is under intense pressure to decide whether to allow college athletes and staff to bet on professional sports.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.\n \n\n   \n  But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.\n \n\n   \n  Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.\n \n\n   \n  “This change recognizes the realities of today’s sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,’’ Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.\n \n\n   \n  The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.\n \n\n   \n  The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association’s commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,’’ Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.\n \n\n   \n  It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner’s protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC’s assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee’s report.\n \n\n   \n  Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.\n \n\n   \n  In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General’s office  announced  14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-gas-leak-ammonia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00Z","title":"Ammonia Gas Leak from a Tanker Truck in Oklahoma Sickens Dozens and Forces Evacuations","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia leaked in Weatherford, Oklahoma, after a mechanical failure in a valve or gasket, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of residents and treatment of 34 people at hospitals, including several in intensive care.

leaking tanker truck spewed dangerous ammonia gas outside a hotel overnight, filling its hallways with fumes and forcing hundreds of nearby residents of a small Oklahoma city to evacuate, authorities said Thursday. Several dozen people were treated at hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak.\n \n\n   \n  An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor.\n \n\n   \n  Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He took off running, but noticed his roommate wasn’t with him and saw that he had run for their trucks. He said a police officer managed to save his coworker.\n \n\n   \n  “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red. His skin was all red.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson found one person stumbling and gave him a shirt to put over his mouth. At one point, he looked at the smoke and saw they were surrounded, thinking “We’re going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers.\n \n\n   \n  Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day.\n \n\n   \n  A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating.\n \n\n   \n  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago,  five people died  in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan.\n \n\n   \n  The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials.\n \n\n   \n  The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.”\n \n\n   \n  The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part.

playbook from Afghanistan for campaign targeting alleged drug boats \n       \n  By Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand, Priscilla Alvarez, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Deep below the US Capitol, in a secure room meant to protect discussions of American secrets, a wave of sarcastic laughter spread among lawmakers and staff members who were assembled to receive a briefing in late October from senior Pentagon officials.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy rear admiral and a top civilian adviser to the defense secretary had made the trip to Capitol Hill to walk lawmakers through an accelerating string of strikes that to date have  now claimed 80 lives . The attacks were part of a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at disrupting the operations of drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  But in a meeting the lawmakers expected would center around growing concerns over whether the military had the legal right to kill traffickers without knowing their identities and without trial, the two Pentagon briefers had left something behind: the military lawyers who had been scheduled to attend.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of the sudden cancellation by the lawyers was immediately seen by some of the lawmakers as a classic stonewalling tactic – with no lawyers around, the Pentagon officials could claim ignorance on legal questions – triggering the wry laughs in the secure room.\n \n\n   \n  But what the Pentagon officials did have to say that day struck several attendees as deeply troubling. It was the way briefers described those killed in the operations – so-called enemy combatants – that seemed to provide evidence that the administration was dusting off the playbook of the drone war in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The briefers discussed the strikes against alleged drug boats in nearly identical terms as those carried out in the Middle East during the global war on terror: Killed in Action, target signature, enemy combatants.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, wait a minute, enemy KIA, what war are we talking about here? What declared conflict am I missing?” one source familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In that and other briefings with lawmakers, military officials have acknowledged they didn’t know the names of those killed, the exact destination of their vehicles or have the documentation to prosecute them for their alleged crimes. But the targets’ actions fit the intelligence of what the briefers referred to as “terrorist” activity and so they were labeled as “enemy KIA,” or killed in action, a phrase used for decades to represent troops perishing on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East. But that campaign occurred during a period when US troops were routinely coming under enemy fire and were facing regular roadside bombings.\n \n\n   \n  US forces operating in and around Latin America have not reported taking fire, and the Pentagon has said no troops have been injured during its recent operations in the region. Nonetheless, the US military has conducted 20 strikes, destroying 21 boats while labeling those killed “narco-terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been explicit in drawing the comparison between terrorist groups and drug trafficking operations in Latin America, calling them the “Al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere.”\n \n\n   \n  “My advice to foreign terrorist organizations, do not get in a boat,” Hegseth said during a recent speech.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes against boats have used drones designed to carry hellfire missiles, the same combination of hardware that had been the backbone of the signature strike campaign in the Middle East, though CNN has reported that AC-130J gunships have also participated in some of the attacks in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  US officials have told Congress they do not need to identify individual targets before killing them – mirroring an argument made by past administrations to justify similar strikes against terror networks.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that a signature is misinterpreted or erroneous and an innocent party is attacked,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior adviser with the CSIS Defense and Security Department.\n \n\n   \n  He described how signature strikes in the Middle East used traits of a target, and how that same logic could be applied to drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Caribbean, that means that if a vessel exhibits characteristics a, b, and c, then it is presumed to be running drugs,” he said, though he added, “It’s possible that the administration has more direct information and is not releasing that to avoid compromising sources and methods.”\n \n\n   \n  But unlike during the war on terror, the Trump administration lacks Congressional authorization for a sustained military campaign against alleged drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of an opinion produced by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers, a distinction with a very clear difference compared to terror groups that have been targeted in similar strikes.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Trump administration lawyers appear to be relying heavily on the President’s broad Article II authority – the section of the Constitution that outlines the role of the president including their command of the military.\n \n\n   \n  Taken together, the Trump administration is testing the bounds of its authority to wage war abroad – fueling concerns among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who continue to question the president’s legal justification for the strikes. It has also raised questions as to what lessons the administration and military may or may not have learned from the decadeslong conflict in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  “How many briefings have I sat in at this point, where there’s some general or admiral sitting there and giving me vignettes about operations, and talking about the number of people they kill, enemy combatants they kill, their boats they blowing up, or tanks they’re blowing up, and how the mission was a success, and none of them could actually tell me what the strategy and endgame was and how they were going to measure success,” Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “And, so this is no different. I mean, they have learned nothing from our last 25 years, it seems,” Crow, who also served three tours in Iraq in Afghanistan and was an Army Ranger, added.\n \n\n   \n    Expansion of strikes\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s broader plan for the counter-drug campaign has not been articulated publicly, top officials have made clear that they intend to continue targeting smugglers using a similar playbook to the one used for killing terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  In practice, current and former US national security officials told CNN the two missions are not so different.\n \n\n   \n  “Network targeting is network targeting,” said one former US intelligence official with knowledge of the administration’s current strategy focused on dismantling drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, the “end state complicates things,” the former official added.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes against alleged drug boats started September 2, announced by President Donald Trump in a post on social media claiming that the boat was being operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. That first strike killed 11, Trump wrote, as he claimed that the gang was being directed by Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That was a theme in the early wave of strikes, as the Trump administration tried to tie Maduro to drug trafficking – namely fentanyl – while attacking boats near the Venezuelan coast in the Caribbean. It coincided with a massive buildup of military assets in the Caribbean, which now includes the Ford Carrier Strike Group and has raised questions about  whether the US intends to strike inside Venezuela  and potentially try to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  While those tensions continue to simmer, the boat strike campaign began to expand to the Pacific Ocean in late October, shifting focus from fentanyl to stopping the movement of cocaine. The announced targets also got less specific. Nearly all of the subsequent strikes including that first in the Pacific were against a “designated terrorist organization,” as announced by Hegseth, mirroring Global War on Terror framing of attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN also reported.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  But the shift to strikes in the Pacific has led to concerns from other countries in Latin America that the boat strike campaign signals a broadening that could only continue.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico has long been viewed by US officials as an epicenter of the drug trade, and Trump, himself, has repeatedly inquired about sending American troops across the southern border to target cartels based there.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s previous offers to send US forces into Mexico have been rebuffed, but the ongoing US military strikes have added a new wrinkle to the already delicate relationship between the two countries, as seen by an unexpected phone call on October 27.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Navy got a call from the Pentagon that day informing officials there may be a survivor in the Pacific Ocean from a US strike.\n \n\n   \n  The call — and the strike prompting it — surprised Mexico as US officials had provided no advance warning. While still in international waters, the incident happened near Mexico’s coast immediately raising concerns about the expansion of the US counter-narcotic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The two other known survivors from earlier strikes were briefly detained on a US Navy ship but ultimately repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia – amid questions about the legality of holding them, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  In Mexico City after the October 27 call, senior Mexican officials scheduled a meeting with the US ambassador to try to understand why Mexico, a close US partner working with the US on counter-drug operations already, was not aware of the strike and what to expect moving forward. A  readout of the meeting  described it as cordial and “aimed to strengthen bilateral coordination between Mexico and the Unted States on maritime matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Weeks later, the Mexican Navy has not located the survivor from that strike after having called off its formal search and the unnamed person is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Mexico has responded to Trump’s focus on the drug trade and framing of terrorist networks driving the trade by trying to placate the Trump administration with numbers— an effort begun well before the strikes commenced. In calls between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump, Sheinbaum has kept the US president updated on progress and metrics as it relates to crime. Trump administration officials said that the two leaders have developed a good relationship, despite Sheinbaum’s public opposition to the administration’s boat strikes, and continue to work together on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that countries cooperatively working with the US on drug smuggling efforts should not be concerned about unilateral US strikes on smugglers from their nations.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to help us find these people and blow them up if that’s what it takes. They’re going to help us with it,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Working with allies\n \n\n   \n  While there are strengths to effectively conducting a counter-terrorism mission at the US border, namely using the full power of the US intelligence community and military to identify vulnerabilities within these various groups, multiple current and former officials told CNN there are also obvious pitfalls.\n \n\n   \n  Those include issues related to collateral damage and managing political outrage from countries that are increasingly concerned the US may violate their sovereignty by conducting lethal strikes within their borders.\n \n\n   \n  Those are similar challenges to what US officials grappled with during the global war on terror.\n \n\n   \n  The former US intelligence official compared the US-Mexico dynamic to that of dealing with Pakistan during that time. Initially, the US refrained from conducting unilateral operations inside Pakistan’s borders, spending years asking for permission before carrying out strikes against suspected terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan never said no, the former official said, and the US eventually moved into a phase of simply notifying the country rather than asking for permission before a strike.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Pakistan, however, the Mexican government has repeatedly said no to Trump when he has raised the prospect of deploying the US military inside the country to target drug groups.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US intelligence officials have insisted that they are collaborating with the Mexican government when it comes to countering the flow of drugs and that any military or covert action carried out across the border will not be done unilaterally.\n \n\n   \n  But that has done little to ease the concerns of Mexican officials who believe that decision, ultimately, lies solely with the President.\n \n\n   \n  While all of the strikes to date have been at sea targeting boats allegedly carrying drugs, lawyers in the Trump administration have been debating potential justifications to extend those strikes to land, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  One strategy they have debated would be to identify land targets the US believes to be associated with drug trafficking and justifying those strikes with a second legal opinion that declares the host country unable or unwilling to address an imminent threat to Americans, sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said. Another possibility is to add Mexican cartels to an existing, secret list of 24 cartels and criminal organizations that the administration argues are legitimate targets. There’s no indication that a decision to conduct land strikes has been made.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the ongoing strikes in international waters are straining relations between the US and allies.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s reporting, Columbia President Gustavo Petro announced that he had ordered the country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the US stops the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  It was the escalation of a public spat between Trump and Petro, who in Columbia leads a country that has been a critical partner in US efforts to combat drugs.\n \n\n   \n  That dispute reached a fever pitch when one of the two survivors of US strikes who is Colombian was repatriated.\n \n\n   \n  The man was subsequently released by Colombian authorities due to a lack of evidence that he was an alleged trafficker, according to Petro, who has continued to question the US strategy of shoot-first and ask questions later.\n \n\n   \n  “Colombia’s prosecutor’s office, independent of the government, cannot investigate without evidence. Thousands of people we captured on boats with the seized cocaine are tried in Colombia, but the method of killing them and not seizing the evidence does not allow for trials; at most, only bodies are collected, without really knowing what they were transporting,” Petro posted on social media.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2025 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/hyundai-georgia-raid-korean-workers-back-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00Z","title":"Some Korean Workers Detained in Georgia Immigration Raid Have Returned to Their Jobs at Hyundai Site","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, a raid by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 475 South Korean nationals at Hyundai’s electric vehicle battery plant in Savannah, Georgia.

left the US following in an  immigration raid  at Hyundai’s electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, some of those workers have returned to America to resume those jobs, their employer said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The September raid shut down work on a battery plant under construction at the sprawling site near Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group began producing electric vehicles last year.\n \n\n   \n   Most of the 475 workers detained  were South Korean nationals. US immigration officials said they entered the US with visas that had expired or with visa waivers that prohibited them from working.\n \n\n   \n  The battery plant’s operator, HL-GA Battery Co., said in a statement Thursday that construction has resumed with a mix of new and returning workers. The company thanked the US and South Korean governments, as well as Georgia officials, “for their collaboration in supporting a smooth and timely return.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain on track to start production in the first half of next year and continue to actively hire local positions to operate the facility,” the battery company’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  An HL-GA Battery spokesperson, Mary Beth Kennedy, confirmed to The Associated Press that some of the returning workers were among the South Korean nationals detained in September. Kennedy said she did not know how many.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 South Korean workers were detained in an immigration raid September 4 at the sprawling site where the Hyundai Motor Group produces electric vehicles near Savannah. The workers spent a week at a Georgia detention center before the South Korean government negotiated their release and flew them home.\n \n\n   \n  The roundup by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which released video showing some of the detained workers shackled in chains, sparked  outrage and feelings of betrayal  in South Korea, a key US ally that has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in American investments.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia raid targeted one of the state’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where  Hyundai produces  electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant. The 475 people detained all worked at the battery plant, which will produce batteries to power Hyundai EVs. It is operated by HL-GA Battery, a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution.\n \n\n   \n  The South Korean nationals detained in Georgia were largely engineers and other highly skilled workers who came to the US temporarily to install equipment and perform other specialized work to get the battery plant up and running.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many of the formerly detained workers are coming back. Jongwon Lee, an attorney in metro Atlanta, said he has firsthand knowledge of two Korean nationals who plan to return after the US State Department confirmed that their B-1 business visitor visas were still valid.\n \n\n   \n  But Kihwan Kim, president of the Federation of Korean Associations for the Southeast US, said some of the workers snared in the raid are hesitant to return to the US.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have to come to the United States to work after that kind of humiliation,” Kim said. “They can go to other countries.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s government demanded improvements to the US visa system for skilled Korean workers. Last month, the South Korean Foreign Ministry announced that US officials had agreed to allow South Korean workers on short-term visas or a visa waiver program to help build industrial sites in America\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump initially defended the  immigration raid  in Georgia, saying in September that the detained workers “were here illegally, ” When asked about those workers again during an October visit to Seoul, Trump said: “I was  opposed  to getting them out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/health/glp-1-hair-loss-telogen-effluvium-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"Why Some People Lose Their Hair When They're on GLP-1s","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the increasing phenomenon of hair loss among individuals using GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound.

  \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.\n \n\n   \n  “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”\n \n\n   \n  A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,   diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.\n \n\n   \n  The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.\n \n\n   \n    What is telogen effluvium?\n \n\n   \n  There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.\n \n\n   \n  Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.\n \n\n   \n    Malnutrition may play a role\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.\n \n\n   \n  Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”   \n \n\n   \n  Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”\n \n\n   \n    Other theories\n \n\n   \n  There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.\n \n\n   \n  Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”\n \n\n   \n  Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum points to a  study  in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.\n \n\n   \n  “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.\n \n\n   \n  “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”\n \n\n   \n  A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.\n \n\n   \n  “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”\n \n\n   \n    Treatments for hair loss\n \n\n   \n  Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”\n \n\n   \n  That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.\n \n\n   \n  “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.\n \n\n   \n  “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”\n \n\n   \n  Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/entertainment/james-van-de-beek-auction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:16:00.000-05:00","title":"James Van Der Beek Auctioning Off ‘Dawson’s Creek’ and ‘Varsity Blues’ Memorabilia Amid Life’s ‘Twists and Turns’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Van Der Beek, best known for his role as Dawson Leery in the 1998–2003 TV series 'Dawson’s Creek', is auctioning off iconic memorabilia from both 'Dawson’s Creek' and the 1999 film 'Varsity Blues' in a live event from December 5 to 7, 2025.

McIver’s legal team argued her actions were part of protected legislative oversight and that the prosecution was vindictive or selective, but the judge found no evidence of vindictiveness and rejected the claim that her actions were disconnected from her duties. The case is a significant political flashpoint highlighting tensions between the executive branch and congressional oversight. McIver, elected in a special election following the death of Donald Payne Jr., remains defiant and has pleaded not guilty.

LaMonica McIver, who was  charged with assaulting federal agents  during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her  May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center  in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver  has pleaded not guilty  and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  The acting US attorney in New Jersey,  Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision is pending.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a  2019 appropriations bill  spelling out that authority.\n \n\n   \n  McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep.

Board, race and ‘equal protection’ through the eyes of the modern Supreme Court \n       \n  By Joan Biskupic, CNN Chief Supreme Court Analyst\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Supreme Court heard arguments in a racially charged  Louisiana voting rights case  last month, down on its ground floor a special exhibit was running a continual loop of commentary from Chief Justice John Roberts and others extolling the desegregation ruling of Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit takes advantage of the  restored bench  used by US district court Judge Ronald Davies, who ordered the enrollment of nine Black students at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Three years after the Brown ruling, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus was still fighting school integration.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s  Cooper v. Aaron  decision, arising from that Arkansas standoff, declared the state bound by Brown and reinforced the mandate of desegregation.\n \n\n   \n  The tone of the justices’ commentary in a video is lofty, such as from Justice Brett Kavanaugh: “Brown v. Board of Education is the single greatest moment, single greatest decision, in this court’s history. And the reason for that is that it enforced a constitutional principle, ‘equal protection of the laws,’ ‘equal justice under law,’ and made that real for all Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the concept of “equal protection of the laws” has shrunk with the modern Supreme Court. That has been evident in the justices’ rulings on race-based measures in education. And  during oral arguments  in the Louisiana case, Kavanaugh was among the justices who suggested the era of racial remedies, in education and voting, must end.\n \n\n   \n  As race endures as a flashpoint for the justices, the court has weakened the spirit and reach of Brown. A series of impending cases may further erode civil rights milestones.\n \n\n   \n  “Brown is a shell now,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, former president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the organization that took the lead in Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  “They will never reverse it,” she said of the justices. “They will just hollow it out. It’s a much more cynical project than rejecting it outright. … It is still incumbent upon this court to reconcile the decisions they’re making today with the truth of that decision.”\n \n\n   \n   Brown’s legacy , say civil rights advocates, permits race to be used in remedial policies to ensure equal opportunity and to enhance diversity. They contend Brown never required governments to be blind to race, especially as prejudice and discrimination endure.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority that controls today’s court has been advancing a “colorblind” ideal and rejecting the kind of race-conscious remedies upheld for decades to address historic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts, Kavanaugh and others on the right-wing envision a country now in an era of racial neutrality, or as the  chief justice famously wrote in 2007 , “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  New cases are on the horizon as activists continue to take advantage of the court’s trend. The group that challenged Harvard and won a 2023 decision striking down race-based college admissions has filed a series of new lawsuits in lower courts, including one challenging the practice of Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii of giving a preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian ancestry.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the pending Louisiana dispute that began with a NAACP Legal Defense Fund claim of vote dilution in redistricting, the justices are scheduled this month to consider appeals that would test whether advocacy groups and other private parties can even bring such Voting Rights Act claims.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  accelerated  a separate line of litigation with its effort to end what’s known as “disparate impact” liability. Such lawsuits have traditionally been brought when an employer imposes a seemingly neutral policy that disproportionately hurts Blacks and other groups protected by civil rights law.\n \n\n   \n  A gap exists between the court’s declarations of equality and the country’s reality, especially considering the Trump administration’s diminishment of civil rights laws that date to the 1960s and its desire to end diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “The justices have been equating equal protection to colorblindness, and in doing that they are ignoring a history of structural racism and the continuing effects that give Black people and other people of color less opportunity,” said Jon Greenbaum, who for more than a decade was chief counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and last year founded Justice Legal Strategies.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going through a period of time where we need greater protection from the court rather than reduced protection,” said Greenbaum, the co-counsel in lawsuits arising from President Donald Trump’s removal of certain officials from independent agencies, such as the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n \n\n   \n    Division over what Brown means\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s reinterpretation of the 1954 Brown v. Board landmark was underway long before Trump first came to office. With Chief Justice Roberts at the lead, the court has ruled against school integration plans and  race-based admissions .\n \n\n   \n  The nine justices came together to offer video commentary for their Brown v. Board of Education exhibit tucked in an alcove behind the oversized sculpture of Chief Justice John Marshall. But they are themselves riven over what Brown means.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2023  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard  decision ending university race-based admissions, Roberts wrote for a six-justice majority that Brown stands for the principle that “eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” even measures that help traditionally excluded Black and Hispanic students.\n \n\n   \n  The three liberal dissenters countered, “Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. … In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts’ limited view of Brown was first on full display in the 2007 dispute over school-integration plans. He relied on the landmark as he invalidated efforts to diversify public schools in Seattle and Louisville.\n \n\n   \n  “Before  Brown , schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” Roberts wrote. “The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again—even for very different reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted Justice John Paul Stevens to declare in dissent, “There is a cruel irony in The Chief Justice’s reliance on our decision in  Brown  v.  Board of Education.  … The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to reject the Seattle and Kentucky school-integration plans in that 2007 controversy, separated himself from the Roberts’ view of Brown and his “all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor” to ensure equal opportunity in schools.\n \n\n   \n  Wrote Kennedy, who retired in 2018, succeeded by Kavanaugh: “The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion.”\n \n\n   \n    Voting Rights Act\n \n\n   \n  The Louisiana redistricting case heard in October arises as the court has been erasing the protections of another milestone of the country’s civil rights era: The 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the arguments, the conservative majority may further restrict remedies for maps that dilute the electoral power of Blacks and Hispanics, particularly in the South.\n \n\n   \n  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act only after the March 7, 1965, “Bloody Sunday” attack on civil rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama. State troopers and other police assaulted the marchers with tear gas, clubs and whips.\n \n\n   \n  The pending VRA case traces to 2022, when Louisiana legislators drew a congressional-district map in which Blacks had the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the six districts, despite the fact that Blacks make up about a third of the population in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A lower US district court ruled that the map diluted Blacks’ electoral power and likely violated the Voting Rights Act; it ordered the state to redraw the map with two Black-majority districts. After the new map was crafted with two districts, White voters sued. The question for the justices is whether that second district unconstitutionally divided people by race.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a new question in a pair of appeals to be reviewed in the justices’ private conference on November 21 turns on whether only the US Justice Department – not private groups – can sue under the VRA to challenge redistricting that dilutes the power of minority voters. The  8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a case  brought by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippawa Indians that that the VRA lacks a provision for such private lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  If the high court were to adopt that approach, few suits to vindicate voting rights would likely be brought. The Justice Department under Trump has retrenched on voting rights litigation. Even administrations interested in broadly enforcing the VRA had limited litigation resources and relied on private advocacy groups.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It was like a ray of hope’\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit highlighting Brown and the bench used by Judge Davies, known as the “Cooper Bench,” is scheduled to remain at the Supreme Court until next summer. Then the artifacts will  return to a permanent exhibit  in Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n  In the current video, the justices touch on dramatic highpoints, including Davies’ bravery in the face of threats and violence, President Dwight Eisenhower’s order of the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, and the leadership of lawyer Thurgood Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  Marshall, as lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, developed the strategy against the “separate but equal” doctrine. In 1967, he became the first Black Supreme Court justice.\n \n\n   \n  The only Black justices since Marshall are Thomas, who succeeded him in 1991, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  The views of Thomas and Jackson on racial remedies and the legacy of Brown are the opposite. They  fiercely clashed  in the SFFA v. Harvard case.\n \n\n   \n  In the exhibit film, they offer observations from personal experience. Jackson refers to her parents, who grew up in the era of segregation, and were able to see her become a Supreme Court  justice.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas recalls the reverence people showed to Brown v. Board in his youth: “They would say ‘Brown,’ as though they had the familiarity of a constitutional scholar. ‘Brown.’”\n \n\n   \n  “For people who were unlettered, for people who were living in that system,” Thomas also relates, “Brown was a godsend, because it said that what was happening that we thought was wrong, they now know that this court said it was also wrong. It’s wrong, not just morally, but under the Constitution of the United States. It was like a ray of hope.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/air-travel-impact-government-reopening","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Government Reopening Boosts Air Travel, But Uncertainty Lingers for Thanksgiving","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government reopened on November 14, 2025, after a 3-month shutdown, ending the longest in history.

What’s that mean for air travel? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People flying home for Thanksgiving this month have their list of things to be thankful for: the turkey, football, time with family. This year, they can also   add  H.R. 5371   to the list.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the funding bill President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday to reopen the government,  ending  the longest government shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after  cuts mandated  by the Federal Aviation Administration led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings”  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But before they get to say grace with family, travelers are now praying Bastian’s assessment is right, even as many questions remain about how quickly air traffic controller staffing will stabilize and when Transportation Security Administration workers will   get paid.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.\n \n\n   \n    When will airlines stop canceling flights?\n \n\n   \n  The morning after the federal government reopened, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was filled with travelers keeping the hectic pace typical of the world’s busiest airport. But a closer look revealed something new: a palpable sense of relief in travelers.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that it will get back to some kind of normalcy or just a little bit better before the holidays,” Metreia White said, before boarding a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Hartsfield-Jackson is one of 40 major airports where airlines are still under  orders  from the FAA to cut   6% of their flights, many on shorter   regional routes . Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the cancellations have been necessary for safety because of air traffic controller staffing shortages during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Fridays and Saturdays have seen the most staffing problems throughout this time, according to data viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers missed  two paychecks  since   the shutdown started on  October 1 , and some are taking second jobs to make ends meet or calling in sick in protest.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been data-based,” Duffy said, citing examples of airplane mishaps at a  news conference  at Chicago O’Hare International Airport. “We’ve seen heightened complaints by pilots of the communication they’re having with air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  But “staffing levels …  improved dramatically ” when it became clear that a funding deal was coming, Bastian said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think our   air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown, and feel more hopeful, and they are coming in,” Duffy said on Tuesday. The  Department of Transportation  stopped short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers started showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain frozen at 6% until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  Logistics can also impact flight schedules, according to Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in a  statement  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Canceling one flight has a domino effect. They’ve had to move different airplanes in untraditional ways,” Sununu added at a news conference on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the challenges, airlines expect to rally quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a  statement  Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Southwest  said  on Wednesday they’re “seeing real progress, and air travel appears to be returning to normal. Our operation remains strong, and Customers can continue to count on Southwest.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines leaders told  employees  in a letter Thursday that they are optimistic about minimizing cancellations in time for the holiday.\n \n\n   \n  “It may take a few days for fully normal controller operations to resume, and we may need to continue to reduce schedules to comply with the FAA’s emergency order requirements,” wrote CEO Robert Ison and Chief Operating Officer David Seymour. “But we have seen promising signs and are confident that because of our strategic planning and work to minimize customer impacts throughout this period, we will recover quickly and deliver a strong Thanksgiving operation.”\n \n\n   \n    When do air traffic controllers get paid?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday her team finished up the administrative work necessary “ late last night ” so TSA employees could receive back pay for paychecks missed during the government shutdown as soon as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve already missed pay periods and recognizing that that’s a hardship on their families,” Noem  said . “So we did all of the administrative work that we needed to late last night to ensure that payroll would be processed as soon as possible, and within the next coming days, they will get that into their bank accounts.”\n \n\n   \n  A DHS spokesperson told CNN the agency “will be working to expedite pay for all employees who were furloughed or working without pay in an excepted status.”\n \n\n   \n  Noem also announced some TSA employees who “stepped up every single day” and “served with exemplary service” through the federal government shutdown would receive a  $10,000 bonus check .\n \n\n   \n  “They were all examples of what we need and we will be continuing to not only recognize employees across the country, but we will be looking at every single TSA official that helped serve during this government shutdown and do what we can to recognize that and help them financially with a bonus check to get them and their family back on their feet,” the secretary said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Duffy  said  that air traffic controllers were expected to get 70% of their back pay “anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens,” with the remainder to come a week later.\n \n\n   \n  Technicians who work on air traffic control equipment are also awaiting their back pay, said David Spero, national president of their union, PASS National.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is going to take time,” said Spero. “We’re going to have people with ongoing pay issues for a while.”\n \n\n   \n  He also said the technicians who continued to maintain air traffic control equipment through the shutdown deserve recognition, too.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking into it and reaching out to FAA leadership now,” Spero said Thursday. “Not one delay in the last 43 days has been attributed to a system outage or an equipment problem.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the long-term impacts on travel?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have acknowledged losing millions of dollars of revenue from the canceled flights, and industry leaders said travelers were getting wary of putting money down on a trip that might not happen.\n \n\n   \n  “The consumer is pulling back,” said Sununu. “Typically, airlines and hotels can be a leading indicator of where folks are spending their money in the economy.”\n \n\n   \n  US  domestic flights  are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site  Going.com , but it’s not clear how those prices were affected by the flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  One bit of ironic luck for both airlines and passengers in the midst of this misfortune, according to the Delta CEO, is that all major carriers were   equally impacted, so the financial loss shouldn’t result in higher ticket prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a competitive marketplace,” said Bastian. “Everyone went through the same thing.”\n \n\n   \n  The airline industry says in the future, the government should guarantee the stability of the air travel system, even in a shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA’s  Airport and Airway Trust Fund  currently has $5 billion that could be used to pay air traffic controllers during future shutdowns,” Airlines for America said in a  statement . “We ask Congress to consider legislation that would implement a long-term solution.”\n \n\n   \n  There are other impacts too, that won’t be solved by the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit,  Duffy told reporters this week , while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n    Could this happen again in January?\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through  January .\n \n\n   \n  That means that airlines and passengers may be grounded again in three months.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does is kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said it takes time to rebuild – both operations and morale – after disruptions like this to the travel industry.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot afford another self-inflicted crisis that threatens the systems millions rely on every day,” said Freeman.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Pete Muntean, Tami Luhby, Chris Boyette and Amanda Musa contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-exam-flights-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"09:10:00-05:00","title":"South Korea bans flights as 500,000 take crucial university admission test","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea implemented a nationwide flight ban at all airports, including Incheon, from 1:05 p.m. to 1:40 p.m. on November 13, 2025, to ensure uninterrupted access to a crucial university entrance exam.

Thursday, according to Palestinian authorities, the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs said settlers attacked the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit in the northern West Bank, calling it a “heinous crime and a blatant assault on the feelings of Muslims.”\n \n\n   \n  “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens’ properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The settlers attacked the mosque early Thursday before morning prayers, according to the Mayor of Deir Istiya.\n \n\n   \n  “Many houses and cars were not attacked, but rather the attack was on a religious symbol to provoke Muslims with offensive phrases against the Prophet [Muhammad] and Muslims,” Abdul Rahim Zidan said in an interview with state-run Palestine TV.\n \n\n   \n  Images shared by the ministry showed writing in Hebrew on the exterior of the mosque saying, “Mohammed is a pig,” a reference to Islam’s prophet, and “Not afraid of Avi Bluth.” Bluth is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander in the West Bank, who issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the settler attacks and

The repeated attacks have marred this year’s olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. The video showed smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women wailing as men carry extinguishers and water buckets in a scramble to douse the fires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN visited the site of the attack and saw charred vehicles, and the damage left around the Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was just a message to scare us, to scare our employees… to try to enforce their reality on the ground… (but) we will continue operations, they can’t stop us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack.

Yoonjung Seo, Brad Lendon, Mike Valerio, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:40 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Secret drone flights from South Korea to the heart of Pyongyang were part of a ploy by the former president to rattle the North Korean leader, South Korean prosecutors have alleged as they released new details of plot they say preceded a foiled attempt to  declare martial law. \n \n\n   \n  Memos found on a senior defense official’s phone purportedly reveal plans by former president Yoon Suk Yeol and two other senior defense officials to aggravate Kim Jong Un enough to justify a shocking late-night military control order issued last December.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the evidence on Monday, appearing to confirm North Korea’s claims that South Korea sent covert drones to the country to drop anti-regime leaflets last October. The flights prompted a rare and fiery statement from Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s powerful sister.\n \n\n   \n  The North vowed to sever all road and rail connections to the South,  blowing up two roads  within its territory, but stopping short of military action. Weeks later, Yoon declared martial law, citing the need to protect the liberal South from “North Korean communist forces.”\n \n\n   \n  The snap decree was lifted within hours when South Korean lawmakers pushed past troops to vote it down, the first step in a reckoning for Yoon that’s still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n   A new indictment Monday  adds to Yoon’s mounting legal battles, which include a trial underway for alleged insurrection, and provides more pieces to a political puzzle that’s yet to be fully explained.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon denies he ordered drones to fly to Pyongyang to provoke North Korea and that he attempted to stage an insurrection through martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, called the indictment “a one-sided prosecution” that “fails to uphold even the basic tenets of legal logic, beyond being absurd.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the spokesperson and a prosecutor for the counsel, Park Ji-young, said prosecutors were “appalled” at what they had uncovered – and on Monday they released memos they say support their claim.\n \n\n   \n    Drones buzzing Kim’s home\n \n\n   \n  The allegations date back to last October, when North Korean state media reported that South Korean drones had  violated Pyongyang’s airspace  on multiple occasions, dropping anti‑regime leaflets.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released photos showing one drone lodged in a tree, described by analysts as resembling a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA also showed images of a drone it said was spotted flying low in the skies above the home of North’s Korean authoritarian supreme leader.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Byung-joo, a retired Korean Army four-star general now a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party, which sits in opposition to Yoon’s former party, told CNN in July that he had received details of the drone flights directly from whistleblowers of South Korea’s Drone Operations Command.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kim, the flights took place on at least three occasions, October 3, October 8-9, and November 13 of last year.\n \n\n   \n  “It is believed that by sending drones into the heart of North Korea and dropping leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un, the aim was to provoke a military response from the North,” the South Korean lawmaker told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like holding a knife to (North Korea’s) neck,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Kim Yo Jong issued her statement on October 12, condemning the airspace incursions and warning of “severe consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Kim Yong-hyun, then South Korea’s defense minister, initially denied sending drones to North Korea, but soon changed his response to say he “could not confirm” North Korea’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  After Yoon’s disastrous attempt to impose martial law, lawmakers from the now ruling Democratic Party demanded an inquiry into allegations the former president conspired to spark a national security crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Once in power, the lawmakers passed a bill to appoint an independent counsel, who released memos on Monday that they say reveal evidence of covert discussions about Yoon’s plans to provoke North Korea, a country with a long history of bombastic threats against South Korea and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  Among notes found on a phone belonging to the former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung were references to creating an “unstable situation,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Must find and exploit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that can produce short-term effects. To do that, we must create an unstable situation or seize an opportunity that has been created,” read one note drafted October 18 last year, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Another note read: “Targeting where (North Korea) loses face to such an extent that they feel they have no option but to respond.” Locations listed included the capital, two nuclear facilities, Kim’s vacation homes, as well as Samjiyon and Wonsan.\n \n\n   \n  Samjiyon is regarded as a sacred site in North Korea for being the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, and a symbolic location tied to his grandfather’s anti-Japanese resistance.\n \n\n   \n  The Wonsan-Kalma tourist area is one of Kim Jong Un’s flagship development projects, that has been hailed as a “great success” by the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Another memo from October 23 stated, “Goal and final status,” containing phrases such as “At minimum-national security crisis” and “At maximum-Noah’s flood,” in a possible reference to Noah’s Ark, where the only survivors of a biblical flood were those on board a mighty ship.\n \n\n   \n  A later note dated November 5 stated, “Enemy action must come first. There must be a wartime situation or a situation that cannot be controlled by police forces. Create the enemy’s conditions… we must wait for the decisive opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Park, the prosecutor’s spokesperson, said further details could not be disclosed due to laws concerning military secrets.\n \n\n   \n  However, she added that evidence from a notebook belonging to former Defense Intelligence Commander Noh Sang-won suggested that discussions and preparations for the martial law were believed to have begun no later than October 2023, after a major reshuffle of South Korea’s military generals.\n \n\n   \n  “The (alleged) act of the President, who holds supreme command over national security, and the defense minister, attempting to use inter-Korean military tensions to create conditions for declaring martial law, is absolutely unacceptable,” said Park.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmaker Kim Byung-joo, the retired general, said he was surprised the North Korean leader did not order a response after alleged South Korean drones were spotted over the capital.\n \n\n   \n  “In hindsight, it was a godsend luck for South Korea that North Korea refrained from any military provocation and stopped at rhetorical threats,” he said. “Had North Korea chosen to respond with military action under those circumstances, it could have escalated into a localized conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s deployment of more than 10,000 troops to Russia as combat soldiers in the war against Ukraine may have dissuaded Kim from acting further, said Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “North Korea could have found it difficult to maintain two war fronts, at the time. Because it would have meant causing a significant gap in combat capability.”\n \n\n   \n    A frustrated leader’s shocking act\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, and his former defense officials Kim and Yeo, all face charges of harming the interest of the state by helping the enemy and abusing their power. The three are already on trial on insurrection charges relating to the  martial law declaration. \n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military has yet to comment on the investigation or the indictment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.  CNN has reached out to lawyers for Kim and Yeo. According to local media, Yeo has said he deeply regrets not challenging Yoon’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, a firebrand conservative who has long taken a hardline on North Korea, narrowly won election in 2022, but his ruling party never had a majority in parliament, and struggled to get its legislative agenda passed. It was a source of constant frustration for his administration, and towards the end of last year, that frustration exploded in spectacular fashion.\n \n\n   \n  On December 3, Yoon declared martial law in a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within the opposition parties in the government that were sympathetic to North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopters and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television.\n \n\n   \n  Though assembly members pushed through the soldiers and voted to overturn the martial law decree, Yoon’s actions triggered mass protests, legal challenges, and ultimately, his removal through impeachment.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say sending drone flights into North Korea could have been interpreted as an act of war, provoking a military response that could have escalated into war.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Peninsula has been divided ever since a brutal war between the North and South ended with an armistice agreement in 1953. But the hostilities have never officially ended and relations between the two neighbors have been precarious ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said if Yoon had ordered the drone flights, it “would represent a dangerous interaction of domestic politics and security policy” in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  “While some national security activities are necessarily clandestine and operate in legal gray areas, robust checks, balances, and policy vetting should ensure they serve national interests rather than personal agendas,” Easley said.\n \n\n   \n  Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the potential international ramifications of the case are considerable, especially for the United States, a South Korean treaty ally with tens of thousands of troops at bases on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Drone flights into North Korea, he added, would violate the armistice agreement between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that the North Koreans violate the armistice all the time, but they’re not held politically accountable for it at home,” he said. “In a democracy like South Korea you can be held politically accountable for that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/paul-ingrassia-general-services-administration-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00-05:00","title":"Ingrassia Serving in New Role in Trump Administration After Withdrawing Nomination for Whistleblower Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his nomination amid allegations of racist and conspiratorial text messages, including claims of having a 'Nazi streak' and offensive remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. Day and racial groups.

Ingrassia, who  withdrew his controversial nomination  to lead the Office of Special Counsel last month, is now serving as deputy general counsel at the General Services Administration, according to a White House official.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s chances of getting through the Senate confirmation process imploded after Politico published a slew of racist text messages that Ingrassia allegedly sent in a group chat, including how he said he has “a Nazi streak.”  CNN’s KFile  also previously reported on Ingrassia’s racist and conspiratorial speech and ties to White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes.\n \n\n   \n   Before his hearing , Senate Leader John Thune said, “He’s not going to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Without support in the Senate, Ingrassia withdrew his nomination but hinted that he would stay in the administration, writing that he “will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to his nomination, Ingrassia has served as White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security, after reportedly being pushed out as White House liaison for the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n   Politico  first reported on Ingrassia’s new role at the GSA.\n \n\n   \n  Among the racist texts, Ingrassia was reported to have said that Martin Luther King Jr. Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell” and to “never trust a chinaman or Indian.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, initially questioned the authenticity of the messages but added that if authentic, they were meant satirically.\n \n\n   \n  “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he wrote in a statement to Politico.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” Paltzik added. In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of Ingrassia’s withdrawal came from his own Truth Social account, as pressure against him mounted. President Donald Trump, who nominated him for the position, did not post about it personally or make an official statement. A White House official confirmed at the time that he was no longer the nominee.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia would have sat before the Senate Homeland Security Committee for a confirmation hearing. However, Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who serves on the committee, said that he didn’t support him, which was a good indicator he was not going to make it through.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-mvp-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:25:00-05:00","title":"Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani unanimously voted MVP for fourth time; Yankees’ Aaron Judge named AL’s back-to-back winner","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani has been unanimously voted the National League’s Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in MLB history to win the MVP award in both leagues.

winner \n       \n  By Jacob Lev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:25 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar  Shohei Ohtani  is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League’s Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league’s best player. New York Yankees right fielder  Aaron Judge  took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani, sitting next to his wife,  Mamiko Tanaka , and their dog,  Decoy , when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.\n \n\n   \n  The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported  $700 million  contract.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight  World Series  win.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a  magical postseason run  that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to  pitching  in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.\n \n\n   \n  The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a  historic season  last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all  30 votes  to win unanimously.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That’s first and foremost, it’s icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”\n \n\n   \n  He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB’s all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.\n \n\n   \n  Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.\n \n\n   \n  Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he’s won.\n \n\n   \n  “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today’s game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”\n \n\n   \n  Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher  Cal Raleigh  and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with  17  first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn’t beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”\n \n\n   \n  With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates’ 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year. Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin was named the NL Rookie of the Year.\n \n\n   \n  Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was named the NL Manager of the Year and Guardians manager Stephen Vogt won AL Manager of the Year for the second consecutive year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/uk/sami-hamdi-uk-us-ice-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:42:00-05:00","title":"British journalist says ICE detention was ‘attack on freedoms’ after 18-day ordeal in US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sami Hamdi, a British journalist and political commentator known for his advocacy of Palestinian rights and criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for 18 days after speaking at a CAIR event in California.

Sana Noor Haq, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:42 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A British journalist and political commentator  detained  by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained  Sami Hamdi , a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport. ICE stopped him the day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala, while he was en route to Florida to speak at a similar event.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza as “political retaliation.”   \n \n\n   \n  Hamdi recounted his 18 day ordeal to CNN shortly after his return to London.\n \n\n   \n  “When I entered San Francisco airport to fly to Florida, I went through security. As I looked for my gate, D38 to Tampa, a man walked up to me and said… ‘your visa was revoked two days ago, so now you are here illegally.’”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said the news came as a surprise, and he told the officials who had approached him that he had not been informed his visa was under review. He said he was then presented with a memo from the US State Department that said his visa had been revoked, without a reason as to why.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about any evidence that would show that Hamdi had overstayed his visa on Thursday, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told CNN that he wasn’t able to speak on specific cases but said: “We’re going to enforce our immigration laws…We’re revoking visas when appropriate, in line with our national security.”   \n \n\n   \n  At the airport, Hamdi said he asked officers for an explanation for the revocation, saying that if there wasn’t one, he would just “book my ticket to London and fly home.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the officers then told him: “‘That’s not the way this works here,’” before escorting him out of the terminal to a vehicle that was waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said he was told to get in the car, but initially refused, telling the officers: “With the greatest of respect, this looks like the movies. I’m not getting in any black car. I’m a British citizen. I have rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his appearances on British TV, his analyses on Middle East developments, for his support of the Palestinian cause – and his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After advocating for a phone call, Hamdi, said he briefly spoke with CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties organization, before he was taken to an ICE facility over four hours away.\n \n\n   \n  “They loaded me into a van with tight cuffs on my feet and on my hands, and they drove me four hours…and a half… I had to do a swap in the middle with a different car. And then they took me to the middle of nowhere,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.\n \n\n   \n  Despite never being charged with a crime, Hamdi said he was kept in shackles in for-profit facilities with little oversight.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality is that those those facilities are dehumanizing to the human beings (there), and when you look at the stories of the other inmates, it only breaks your heart,” he said, recounting multiple stories of fathers with green cards who had been detained without charge.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not that the courts won’t find them innocent, it’s that it seems there’s a concerted effort to make sure they do not go in front of a judge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi said shortly after he returned back to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi first came under fire after speaking at an event in London in 2023 following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. There, he told his audience not to pity Palestinians but rather to “celebrate the victory,”    in remarks from a speech that he told CNN were taken out of context.\n \n\n   \n  In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “My argument was that we have to solve the issue of the rights of the Palestinians. We have to solve the issue of occupation, apartheid, and that will bring peace to the region,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” he said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he added, alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights organizations have criticized the actions of the Trump administration, saying that they violate free speech protections, which apply to anyone who is legally in the US, regardless of citizenship status.\n \n\n   \n  Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  While Hamdi said he is mulling whether to sue US authorities, he also said he would rather take what he considers a win, and instead “celebrate” the decisions of the “cool heads” in the US State Department and federal court system.\n \n\n   \n  “I won this case, the extremists failed to silence my voice, they failed to remove my freedom of speech. America stood with me,” he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending time with his family and a game of soccer over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  While he said he is grateful for the global attention brought to his case, he also implied that he is keen to exit the limelight.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story is about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/health/tick-bite-alpha-gal-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-05:00","title":"New Jersey Man Is First Known Death From Meat Allergy Triggered By Tick Bites","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A previously healthy 47-year-old man from New Jersey died in 2024 after consuming red meat, following multiple bites from baby lone star ticks during a camping trip.

An autopsy provided no answers. Everything looked normal, and his death was ruled sudden and unexplained.\n \n\n   \n  His widow reached out to a friend, a pediatrician. Would she read the autopsy report?\n \n\n   \n  The pediatrician, Dr. Erin McFeely, acted on a hunch and contacted Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia who had discovered almost two decades earlier that tick bites could cause people to develop an allergy to red meat.\n \n\n   \n  The allergy is unusual because the reaction doesn’t happen right away. People start to feel sick hours after they unwittingly eat beef, pork or lamb. Often, they’ll wake up in the middle of the night with symptoms that seem more like a bad bout of food poisoning or stomach flu than an allergy.\n \n\n   \n  Because so many people have potentially been sensitized to meat after tick bites but don’t know it, Platts-Mills and others have wondered whether there were unexplained deaths that were really severe reactions to a sugar found on mammalian cells, including those in red meat, called alpha-gal.\n \n\n   \n   The man’s case , which was detailed Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, turned out to be exactly what Platts-Mills had feared and is believed to be the first documented death linked to a red meat allergy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time I’ve heard a story that I thought we could sort out,” said Platts-Mills, who is part scientist and part Sherlock Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  “We need the serum” – the clear part of the patient’s blood – which was taken during his autopsy. He asked McFeely, “Can we get it?”\n \n\n   \n    Tick bites turn deadly\n \n\n   \n  The man’s story started with chigger bites, the case study says. But they weren’t chiggers; they were baby lone star ticks, about the size and color of a grain of sand.\n \n\n   \n  The man had been bitten by dozens of these tiny seed ticks on a camping trip with his family.\n \n\n   \n  “And this tick, the mothers, lay 5,000 eggs at a time, and the larvae will bite you,” Platts-Mills told CNN . \n \n\n   \n  In many parts of the eastern United States, the deer population has reached unsustainable numbers. Deer are the main hosts of the lone star tick, and as deer populations have grown, tick populations have exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “That combination of so many deer and so many mothers and the larvae biting means that vast numbers of people are sensitized, of whom a minority get food-related symptoms and then are at risk of severe events,” Platts-Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Alpha-gal allergy is a reportable diagnosis in only three states – Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia – so the actual number of cases in the US is not known. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  that as many as 450,000 Americans may have the allergy, but Platts-Mills estimates that as much as 5% of the population may be sensitized to red meat because of tick bites and not know it.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are not severe and can be managed by avoiding exposure to the sugar, which is found in food as well as in some pharmaceutical products. Symptoms range in severity from itchy hives or a rash to nausea and vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the lips or face, dizziness or fainting, and severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnose the condition by taking a careful history and controlled testing for a reaction to the sugar.\n \n\n   \n  Sometime after the camping trip, the case study says, the man’s family ate a late steak dinner. He woke at 2 a.m. with intense stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. He was in rough shape, but after two hours, his symptoms subsided.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, he told one of his sons, “I thought I was going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  His wife said they considered going to a doctor, but since the symptoms had eased, they didn’t know what they would say.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that a doctor’s visit would have helped. Too often, doctors don’t recognize alpha-gal allergy.  A 2023 CDC survey  found that 42% didn’t know what it was, and 35% said they lacked confidence to diagnose or manage it.\n \n\n   \n    An unrecognized allergy\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks later, in September 2024, the man and his wife went to a cookout, where he had a hamburger about 3 p.m. He drank a beer and came home and mowed the lawn. But by 7:20 p.m., he was vomiting again. His son called his mother and told her, “Dad is getting sick again.”\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the son found his father unconscious on the bathroom floor. He couldn’t be revived.\n \n\n   \n  Platts-Mills says that when he   was back in his lab, having gone through the necessary layers of permission to get the man’s postmortem blood samples, he cursed himself for not driving up to New Jersey to collect them himself.\n \n\n   \n  The delivery company lost track of them briefly, he said. He imagined them sitting for hours in the back of a hot truck, the valuable information they contained being baked away.\n \n\n   \n  They finally arrived in his lab in April, and he tested them for levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies, Y-shaped proteins primed to latch onto allergens like ragweed and pollen. The man had antibodies to both alpha-gal sugars and red meat.\n \n\n   \n  Next, Platts-Mills sent some of the blood to the Mayo Clinic lab, which tested it for an enzyme called tryptase that’s made by immune cells called mast cells. Tryptase breaks down proteins and is a marker of allergic reactions.\n \n\n   \n  The man’s tryptase levels were over 2,000 nanograms per milliliter, among the highest values ever recorded in cases of fatal allergic reactions called anaphylaxis.\n \n\n   \n  The man had died of eating red meat – the first known food allergy fatality linked to alpha-gal syndrome.\n \n\n   \n  Other people  have died of reactions to alpha-gal sugars , but those cases have involved sugars attached to a chemotherapy drug called cetuximab, which was how the syndrome was discovered in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “We gave them closure,” Platts-Mills said of the family in the case study.   “People make a big fuss about closure, but you don’t get it until you see it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/michigan-business-jet-ntsb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00Z","title":"Business jet that crashed in Michigan was flown after pilots chose not to wait for a test pilot, NTSB says","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Mexican-registered Raytheon Hawker 800XP business jet crashed in Bath Township, Michigan on October 16, 2025, killing three people — two pilots and a maintenance representative.

But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize  rallies  in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Eitan Horn, who was  recently freed  after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square last weekend: “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey. We have no future without the return of all the hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  Other freed hostages have expressed the same sentiment, saying they cannot begin to heal until all of the hostages – living and deceased – have returned home.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/media/bbc-trump-panorama-legal-threat-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"BBC Signals It Will Fight, Not Fold Under Trump’s Political Pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is standing firm against a $1 billion defamation lawsuit threat from Donald Trump’s legal team, rejecting a settlement and asserting that the editing error in a 'Panorama' documentary does not constitute defamation.

BBC signals it will fight, not fold under Trump’s political pressure \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:37 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least half a dozen major media companies have stared down legal threats from President Trump this year. Some have chosen to fight, others have opted to fold. The BBC is signaling that it will fight.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the British national broadcaster responded to a  demand letter  from Trump’s lawyers by  apologizing for an editing error  but arguing that the president doesn’t have a serious case.\n \n\n   \n  The public response indicated that if Trump goes ahead and sues, the BBC will vigorously defend itself, rather than immediately seek to settle the matter out of court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a pivotal moment in the ongoing tug-of-war between Trump and the news outlets that strive to report on him independently and confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is a fight about stopping Trump from deploying his pattern of intimidation, bluster and threats against an organization that plays a huge role in setting the global media agenda,” Joel Simon, the founding director of the Journalism Protection Initiative, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Simon, who has been  chronicling  the BBC’s efforts to expand in the US, said the dustup is also “about the ability of the British public to determine what kind of media it wants, and what kind of BBC, without Trump mucking it up.”\n \n\n   \n  In the US this year, Trump has proven adept at applying political and legal pressure to media owners — and has squeezed settlement payments and other concessions out of some, but not all, of them.\n \n\n   \n  Media critics and consumers have worried that Trump’s attempts at intimidation and dominance have caused journalists to soften and self-censor aggressive reporting.\n \n\n   \n  But some newsroom leaders and media moguls have recognized that Trump’s tests are an opportunity to reaffirm their independence.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC seems to be doing that.\n \n\n   \n  As outgoing BBC director general Tim Davie said the other day, “We have to fight for our journalism.”\n \n\n   \n    No payout, no retreat\n \n\n   \n  Let’s be clear about what happened: Someone at the BBC’s “Panorama” newsmagazine program screwed up by stitching together two different clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech hours ahead of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  No one seemed to notice the error when the documentary first aired in October 2024. But when the editing error was publicized last week, the BBC was too slow to address the controversy, giving Trump even more of an opening to target the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness  resigned on Sunday , citing the need for leaders to take responsibility, even though the mistake was made much further down the editorial chain.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, BBC chair Samir Shah acknowledged an “error in judgment” with the clip. By then, Florida-based lawyers for Trump had sent the BBC a letter claiming the documentary caused Trump “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and warning of a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts scoffed at the letter, saying Trump’s chances of winning such a lawsuit were low.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has pursued other legal claims in the past despite a similarly low likelihood of success. And some institutions have folded under the pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Disney , the parent of ABC, and  Paramount , the parent of CBS, decided to strike settlement deals with Trump rather than risk court battles. Both media companies made payments toward Trump’s future presidential library, triggering widespread outrage.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as the BBC said it received a legal threat from Trump, speculation arose about a similar payout by the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  But there has been no such settlement or secret side deal, a senior BBC source told CNN. And if such a payout were ever to occur, it would be publicly disclosed. The BBC, after all, is primarily funded through license fees paid by British taxpayers.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s own news coverage of Thursday’s legal reply to Trump emphasized that the broadcaster had “rejected his demands for compensation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s lawyers had given the BBC a Friday deadline to respond. The president had no immediate reaction to the broadcaster’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    The pros and cons of standing tall\n \n\n   \n  News outlets that have stood up to Trump this year have garnered praise from readers. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, for instance, are both fighting suits that were filed on Trump’s behalf by the same Florida law firm.\n \n\n   \n  The suit against The Times was initially  thrown out  by a judge in September for being “decidedly improper and impermissible.”\n \n\n   \n  When the lawyers refiled a shorter version, The Times was forceful in its response. “As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: This lawsuit has no merit,” a newspaper spokesperson said. “This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate P.R. attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n \n\n   \n  Media executives have pointed out, however, that court battles can be costly and unpredictable.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials may find themselves hoping that Trump gets distracted and moves on to a new target.\n \n\n   \n  When Disney briefly suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration in September, the consumer backlash was swift, including in the form of Disney+ subscriber cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  And when Disney brought Kimmel back on the air — showing a willingness to fight after briefly deciding to fold — Trump made one more blustery threat against ABC. But then he evidently moved on; the government hasn’t taken any known action against the network, and the president hasn’t brought up Kimmel in nearly two months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/jesse-jackson-hospitalized-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:04:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Rev.

The changes come months after a viral video of a student confronting an instructor over her lessons threw the campus into upheaval.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy will apply to all 12 schools within the system, including at Texas A&M, the flagship campus that is one of the largest universities in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy states that no academic course “will advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” unless approved in advance by a campus president.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy appears to be the first time that a public university system in Texas has put in rules on what faculty can talk about in their classroom on the topics of race and gender.\n \n\n   \n  Other university systems in Texas have also placed restrictions on classroom instruction or have begun internal reviews of course offerings following a new state law.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the new policy say it would impede the ability of faculty to teach, undermine academic freedom and could be a violation of First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  “It really strikes at the heart of what education means and what universities do, which is circulate the exchange of knowledge without fear of retaliation, without fear censorship,” Rana Jaleel, chair of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom, said about the A&M system’s new policy.\n \n\n   \n  Various universities and their presidents around the country, including  Harvard ,  Columbia , and the  University of Virginia , have come under increased scrutiny this year from conservative critics and the administration of President Donald Trump over  diversity, equity and inclusion practices  and the schools’ responses to  campus protests. \n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Trump asked nine major universities , including the University of Texas at Austin, to agree to various provisions, including commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman” and to promote conservative views on campus.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy defines “race ideology” as a “concept that attempts to shame a particular race or ethnicity, accuse them of being oppressors in a racial hierarchy or conspiracy” or assigns “them intrinsic guilt based on the actions of their presumed ancestors or relatives.” The policy defines “gender ideology” as a “concept of self-assessed gender identity replacing and disconnected from the biological category of sex.”\n \n\n   \n  “The goal is transparent and document cocurricular review, not policing individual speech,” James Hallmark, vice chancellor for the Texas A&M University System’s Office of Academic Affairs, told the regents.\n \n\n   \n  In approving the policy, regents did not refer to September’s  firing of Melissa McCoul , a senior lecturer in the English department at Texas A&M University, after video was made public in which she argued with a female student over gender identity being taught in a children’s literature class. McCoul’s firing came after political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Gov.  Greg Abbott .\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after McCoul’s termination, Texas A&M’s then president,  Mark A. Welsh III, resigned.  He did not offer a reason for stepping down but he and the school had faced political pressure and criticism, including from Abbott, after the video was posted on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Bright, president of the American Association of University Professors A&M chapter, said he believes McCoul’s case opened the door for the university system to put this policy in place.\n \n\n   \n  “Our job is to teach facts, teach the truth, and if … we have to use a litmus test of whether or not it meets someone’s approval, and it could be quite frankly their political approval, then we have no truth,” Bright, who is a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told the AP ahead of the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  During Thursday’s meeting, eight Texas A&M professors and instructors, including Bright, spoke against the policy, with many calling on regents to rehire McCoul.\n \n\n   \n  Two A&M professors spoke in favor of the policy, including Adam Kolasinski, with the Department of Finance, who said he didn’t believe the policy violated academic freedom and that “academic freedom does not mean you get to teach whatever you want.”\n \n\n   \n  Regent Sam Torn said the policy was being put in place to “make sure we are educating, not advocating.”\n \n\n   \n  A Texas law that forbids Texas K-12 schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity took effect on Sept. 1. The law does not apply to universities and other institutions of higher education.\n \n\n   \n  Texas A&M is located in College Station, about 95 miles (153 kilometers) northwest of Houston.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-clase-ortiz-plead-not-guilty-gambling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:16:00.000Z","title":"Cleveland Pitcher Emmanuel Clase Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges Alleging He Rigged Pitches","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase pleaded not guilty to federal charges alleging he rigged pitches to help gamblers in the Dominican Republic win bets, with co-accused teammate Luis Ortiz also facing similar charges.

peace of the Americas, Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  told CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon in the middle of a rally in Caracas on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  His exclusive remarks come amid heightened tensions with the US, which has  deployed warships  to the Caribbean to target what it claims are drug trafficking vessels from Venezuela. Though Washington insists the military buildup is aimed at disrupting the flow of narcotics to the United States, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro urged the US against entering another prolonged conflict, asking its people in Spanish: “To unite for the peace of (the Americas). No more endless wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan.”\n \n\n   \n   Asked if he had a message for US President Donald Trump, Maduro replied in English: “Yes peace, yes peace.”\n \n\n   \n  He did not directly answer whether he was concerned about possible aggression from the US. Instead, he simply replied that he was focused on governing his country with peace.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro was attending a mass rally for Venezuela’s youth, whom he later urged to resist what he described as a threat of invasion from the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past three months, the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the Caribbean alongside more than a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform.”\n \n\n   \n  The build-up, considered the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989, has raised speculation that the US may be preparing for a larger conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US says it has carried out at least  20 strikes  against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing 80 people.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that the Trump administration is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside the South American nation. But the administration has also told Congress in recent days that the US did not have a legal justification that would support strikes within Venezuela, though CNN has reported that officials are considering what such a legal opinion would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela has responded by launching a massive  mobilization  of military personnel as well as militia forces made up of civilians. The units have been carrying out exercises across the country to prepare for any potential threat from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The country also appears to have installed large objects on a key highway that are commonly used to block military vehicles such as tanks. A satellite image captured by Vantor on November 10 shows “hedgehog” anti-vehicle obstacles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, which is the main route into the city from the coast. The obstacles first appeared there over a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, has some 123,000 members. Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-files-house-vote-johnson","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-05:00","title":"Johnson shifts strategy on Epstein files vote – as GOP leaders brace for mass defections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has reversed his previous strategy of delaying a vote on a bipartisan bill to release Jeffrey Epstein case files, opting instead to expedite a full House vote due to mounting momentum and public pressure. The bill, co-led by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, requires a two-thirds majority to be veto-proof and is expected to pressure President Donald Trump and the Senate into action.

\n        5:31 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson decided to  quickly schedule a House vote  on an effort to force the release of all of the Jeffrey Epstein case files once the calculation was made that it couldn’t be stopped.\n \n\n   \n  The decision marked a shift in strategy for Johnson and the White House, who had long sought  to delay the process , ​three sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from  President Donald Trump  and support the bipartisan bill led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — as supporters push for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  Republican sources say there’s a broad cross-section of the conference willing to support the plan — and it will be hard to limit defections.\n \n\n   \n  “No point in waiting,” one House GOP leadership source familiar with the strategy shift told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A House GOP lawmaker said of the speaker’s decision: “If you got to do it, might as well do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie told CNN on Wednesday that his hope is that a veto-proof majority will pressure the Senate to act over Trump’s opposition. It would require two-thirds of the House — or 290 votes if all members are present — for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get less than two-thirds vote when it comes up for a vote, I think it’s an uphill battle,” Massie said. “But if we are somehow able to get two thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president.”\n \n\n   \n  A Senior White House official told CNN that Trump was made aware ahead of time that Johnson was going to expedite the vote, and that the two had spoken about it.\n \n\n   \n  “It was made clear to President Trump, and he understands that this is an inevitable reality,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson sent the House of Representatives home for its August recess early – in part to avoid a  vote  related to the Epstein files. When the House returned in September, top congressional Republicans and White House allies were working  behind the scenes  to prevent the politically charged vote. And there was even a last-ditch effort by the president and his allies on Wednesday  to engage with  two of the Republican women helping the effort move forward before it was too late.\n \n\n   \n  But now, GOP sources told CNN, part of the calculation is that the momentum in the House is unstoppable and the only course of action is to send it over to the Senate to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it out of the House,” another GOP lawmaker in support of the strategy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, Massie and Khanna were expecting it to be weeks before their bill would get a vote on the House floor.\n \n\n   \n  Even after the bipartisan duo secured the 218 signatures needed to move forward on Wednesday, there was still a procedural process that had to play out because the effort did not have the blessing of House Republican leadership to come to the floor sooner.\n \n\n   \n  So when Johnson said Wednesday that he was going to expedite the process and put the bill on the floor next week, many were surprised.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson  said  on Wednesday, adding, “In the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given the ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the panel on Wednesday and top Trump administration officials  met with  GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of the few Republicans who signed onto the effort demanding DOJ release its trove of Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t block the parade, you might as well get ahead of it,” Khanna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  If Massie and Khanna’s bill clears the House, as is now expected, it’s fate in the Senate remains uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/chicago-ice-arrests-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:07:00-05:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Illinois Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of hundreds of individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz — a mass immigration crackdown by ICE agents in Illinois between June and October 2025.

\nUpdated: \n        6:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to a court ruling, dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Of those arrested, 615 are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Cummings stated he would allow their release on a $1,500 bond and enrollment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Alternatives to Detention program, which can include electronic monitoring, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered the government to identify the people who are eligible for release by noon Friday and paused deportation proceedings for them until the next business day after their release.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the immediate release of 13 people who were arrested in violation of a consent decree that limits warrantless arrests, specifying they are to be released on their own recognizance without bond or conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The judge further ordered the government to produce by November 19 the names and threat levels of the approximately 3,000 people arrested since June.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented people – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  Challenges remain for those ordered to be released, immigration experts said in response to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested people have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week, finding her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his Customs and Border Protection agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  That news came days after Bovino was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/fetterman-hospitalized-fall","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00Z","title":"Pennsylvania Sen.

from redistricting to give Democrats more House seats \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration moved Thursday to challenge California’s effort to redraw the state’s  congressional maps  ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, throwing the full weight of the Justice Department in the high-stakes battle over control the House of Representatives next year.\n \n\n   \n  After voters in the Golden State approved a ballot measure last week that allows state Democratic lawmakers to replace congressional lines drawn by the state’s independent commission  with new ones  that make five Republican-held US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the California Republican Party and others raced to court to block the redistricting effort.\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s move to join that lawsuit is a dramatic escalation in the legal challenge, which, if successful, could scramble Democrats’ plan to push back against a nationwide effort by Republicans, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to boost the party’s chance of holding on to their House majority through rare, mid-decade redistricting ploys across several states.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the Trump administration told the federal judge overseeing the case in the Central District of California on Thursday that days after the case was brought last week, the “federal interest” in the matter became clear given the constitutional issues and claims of race-based discrimination at stake in the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that the redistricting plan was sold to voters as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  “Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,” the Justice Department lawyers  wrote in court papers . “Because the Proposition 50 map does, the United States respectfully requests that this court enjoin defendants from using it in the 2026 election and future elections.”\n \n\n   \n  “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,” said Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, cast California’s plan as a “brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process.”\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    64% of voters backed Newsom plan\n \n\n   \n  Democrats argued the measure, Proposition 50, was necessary to counter Texas’ new congressional map, which Republicans redrew in a bid to gain five seats at Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  While Texas Republicans were able to draw new lines with legislation, California Democrats needed voters to pass a constitutional amendment to temporarily override the state’s non-partisan independent redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  Over  64% of voters  approved the plan.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats significantly outraised and outspent Republicans in the state. Newsom became the face of the measure, arguing that Democrats needed to “fight fire with fire” to prevent the president from skewing the 2026 midterm election map. Other key surrogates, including former President Barack Obama, joined the effort, which Democrats see as key to their chances of retaking the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not usual for the federal government to get involved in election-related cases. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department had its hands in litigation over state efforts to purge voter rolls and certain restrictive voting measures enacted in GOP-led states.\n \n\n   \n  The California case hasn’t developed much since it was brought last week. Newsom and the other stare officials named as defendants have yet to file responses to the allegations and the judge randomly assigned to the case has not scheduled any major court hearings. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been allowed to join the case to defend the redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n    Trump has backed pro-GOP efforts\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s decision to  join the California lawsuit  is noteworthy given Trump’s call for Republicans state lawmakers to redraw their maps ahead of next fall’s elections to help the very thin GOP majority in the House.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department’s involvement in the California effort is not the first time this year that it has inserted itself into the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  In July, as attention was turning to Texas’ congressional maps, a top DOJ official sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton that raised “serious concerns” about the “legality” of four districts in the state.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ official, Harmeet Dhillon, urged the state to “rectify” the issues or risk legal action from the department. The following month, several of the districts flagged by Dhillon were impacted by the state’s redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-04:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 43-day federal government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, has ended after President Donald Trump signed a compromise bill passed by both the House and Senate.

Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the bill extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the package, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions will continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The package fully funds the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance. Agriculture Sec.

Both have pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    The limit does not exist, DOJ argues\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of Thursday’s dispute is whether the 120-day limit imposed for interim US attorneys is truly a limit or a guidance for when the attorney general needs to reassess their selection.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorneys argue that following the limit, an interim appointee must be confirmed by the Senate or have their appointment extended by the judges of the district they serve.\n \n\n   \n  If Halligan can be appointed as the head prosecutor of the Alexandria, Virginia, office despite the limit on individuals serving in the job on an interim basis, McDowell argued, then that guardrail is useless.\n \n\n   \n  Her appointment, he said, acted as an “evasion of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued Thursday that the “government’s reading” of the federal law at issue requires the judge “to add words” to it.\n \n\n   \n  The underlying statute, Whitaker said, doesn’t say the attorney general can only “cram multiple appointments” in one, 120-day period, but instead can continue to select and re-evaluate.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not argue that the attorney general,” Whitaker continued, has a “fire and forget” authority. “The idea that we are going to try to evade Senate confirmation,” is “fanciful.”\n \n\n   \n     US v Trump  \n \n\n   \n  The Judge presiding over the issue of Halligan’s appointment, Cameron McGowan Currie, pressed Whitaker Thursday on whether the government believed the classified documents case in Florida against Donald Trump was incorrectly dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in that case,  Aileen Cannon,  found that then-special counsel Jack Smith was wrongly appointed in part because the Senate had not confirmed him to the role.\n \n\n   \n  The question drew gasps from the audience in the courtroom and came toward the tail end of the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker proceeded to walk a tight legal rope by arguing that Smith would not have even met the qualifications for a US Attorney and enjoyed “unique and broad” powers as a special counsel.\n \n\n   \n  “You wouldn’t have appointed Jack Smith” as a US attorney, Whitaker said, adding that “the attorney general has full authority” to appoint those who qualify.\n \n\n   \n     Missing time  \n \n\n   \n  Currie also laid into Whitaker during the hearing on whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had reviewed the grand jury transcript in James Comey’s case, noting there was no record of anything that happened after 4:28pm ET that day. Comey wasn’t indicted for nearly two hours after that, according to available court transcripts.\n \n\n   \n  “It became obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the entire proceeding, Currie said, adding that it appeared “there was no court reporter present” at the time of the missing portion.\n \n\n   \n  In preparation for Thursday’s hearing, Currie privately reviewed the transcripts and said previously that she thought looking at the transcripts was “necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN following the hearing, a representative for the Justice Department denied that there was anything missing from the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no ‘missing two hours.’ That time period refers to when the jurors were deliberating behind closed doors, which would not be included in a transcription,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ, however, did not offer an explanation for the gap in court.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said she would issue a decision over Halligan’s appointment before Thanksgiving, with both trials currently set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/donald-trump-epstein-political-danger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:56:00Z","title":"The Political Danger of the Epstein Files for Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the political risks facing Donald Trump due to the newly released Epstein emails and the administration’s resistance to releasing full disclosure of the Epstein files.

(The White House said the emails “prove absolutely nothing.”)\n \n\n   \n  In one of those emails from 2011, Epstein expressed surprise to accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump’s name hadn’t surfaced amid accusations involving Epstein. Epstein added that Trump had at one point spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2019, Epstein appeared to signal Trump was quite aware of Maxwell recruiting girls from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 2000s, saying “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  While some have claimed these emails show Trump had knowledge of or even involvement in Epstein’s crimes, it’s not nearly so evident. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has acknowledged meeting Trump and never accused him of wrongdoing. And Trump has acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees including Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. (The big question there is whether Trump had any inkling about what Maxwell was recruiting a minor female like Giuffre  for .)\n \n\n   \n  But also notable on Wednesday was Trump’s reaction.\n \n\n   \n  As all this was going down, he and his White House seemed preoccupied with what appeared to an  11th-hour campaign to thwart  a House discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing the full Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  With the petition due to get a decisive 218th signature when a new Democratic member of Congress was sworn in later that day, the White House held a meeting in the Situation Room with a key GOP lawmaker who’d signed on, while another said she was playing phone tag with the president. Both GOP congresswomen later told CNN Trump hadn’t personally lobbied them to remove their names. But the president also  publicly pressured  Republicans who sided with Democrats on forcing Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  It was a weird move, to be sure. No Republicans removed their names from the petition, and Speaker Mike Johnson quickly said he would schedule a vote for next week on compelling the Justice Department to release the full files.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the measure passes in the House, that’s not the end of the story. The GOP-led Senate would still have to take it up, and Trump would still have to sign it. So it’s not like this will cause the imminent release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s resistance to something his base has long clamored for – and the optics of the Situation Room meeting in particular – would only seem to deepen the huge suspicions that a large number of Americans already harbor about the government covering up Epstein-related matters.\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at the big point here – and the political danger for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  This is merely the latest baffling episode in the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. Among  the others :\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump doesn’t have anything to hide, the danger here is in making it look a whole lot like he does.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are primed to believe there’s a real conspiracy beneath the surface, and Trump’s actions risk making him own it.\n \n\n   \n  The polling tells the tale.\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps Trump’s worst issue, by the margin who disapprove. Americans generally disapprove of his and the administration’s handling of the Epstein matter by around a 3-to-1 margin in most polls. The most recent poll, a Reuters-Ipsos survey from last month, showed Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of it 57%-19%. Independents disapproved 59%-10%.\n \n\n   \n  And like virtually every other survey on the topic, not even a majority of Republicans said they approved: 44%.\n \n\n   \n  Americans are also quite unhappy with the administration’s transparency and disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  An August  Pew Research Center survey  showed 63% of Americans and even 38% of Republican-leaning Americans had little or no trust in what the Trump administration was saying about the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, an  August Quinnipiac University poll  showed voters said 73%-16% that the Justice Department wasn’t being transparent about its investigation.\n \n\n   \n  All of that said, this is clearly not a top-tier issue for most Americans. Relatively few have seemed to be paying close attention. Only about one-quarter were following it “extremely” or “very” closely in the  Pew survey .\n \n\n   \n  But crucially, it’s also something Americans are liable to believe the worst about.\n \n\n   \n  To wit:\n \n\n   \n  That same poll showed even 33% of Republicans said Trump hadn’t gone far enough to get to the bottom of Epstein matters.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, only 26% of Americans and just 55% of Republicans were willing to rule out that Trump had engaged in crime with Epstein. (Trump hasn’t been charged with any crimes related to Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s a lot of Americans who are inclined to believe the worst here – or are at least willing to entertain it. People also seem to have very little confidence and trust in what the administration is doing or saying about all of this.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s conduct just keeps giving them reason to be suspicious.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/venezuela-military-us-tensions-explainer-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"How Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era military stacks up against US forces in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the growing military tension in the Caribbean, spurred by a significant U.S. naval buildup—including the USS Gerald R.

Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The buildup of US naval forces in the Caribbean, boosted by the recent arrival near Latin America of the  USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier , has raised speculation that both the United States and Venezuela may be  preparing for a larger conflict. \n \n\n   \n  While the US has characterized the buildup as aimed at combating drug trafficking, some experts have questioned why so much firepower is needed if the sole aim is targeting drug boats. They note that the ship’s arrival marks the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself – described as the US Navy’s “ most lethal combat platform ” – the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the region alongside more than a dozen warships – including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship and amphibious assault vessels – and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  That sort of firepower brings into sharp relief what experts characterize as the aging Soviet-era equipment Venezuela would be relying on if US President Donald Trump  were to decide  on military action inside the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the forces at Caracas’ disposal:\n \n\n   \n    A tough, but aging, Soviet image\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), has built a reputation over the past two decades as a regional military power a cut above most of its neighbors in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that image was forged through the sustained acquisition of Russian equipment under Maduro’s predecessor, the late President Hugo Chávez, a former professional soldier who owed his ascent to power to the revolutionary movement he founded within the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  After Chávez became president in 1999 (seven years after he organized a failed military coup), he funneled the country’s massive oil resources into the military, buying Russian equipment due to an informal US embargo and placing military men in key government positions.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, weapons systems such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 battle tanks, S-300, Pechora and Buk anti-aircraft missiles, portable Igla-S systems and Kalashnikov rifles – all designed in Soviet times, have come to define the FANB’s image. The arsenal distinguishes the Venezuelan forces from other militaries in the region, which tend to rely more heavily on US or European weaponry (though Venezuela still has some aging US-designed equipment from pre-Chávez days).\n \n\n   \n    A paper tiger?\n \n\n   \n  The problem for Venezuela is that while on paper it has a relatively well-equipped military, question marks hang over the maintenance of its equipment and the training of its personnel – not least because the country has suffered more than a decade of economic hardship, one of the world’s  highest rates of inflation  and a drop in oil production, all made worse by US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Partly due to this economic collapse, about 7.9 million Venezuelans – many of them young people of military service age – have left the country, according to UN data.\n \n\n   \n  Though the government “recently resumed modest maintenance and modernization efforts,” according to a 2024 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), years of underinvestment have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  “The FANB has a rather low level of operational capability and asset availability, partly because they’ve been through more than a decade of economic crisis in the country,” Andrei Serbin Pont, an analyst specializing in defense at the CRIES think tank, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Military and militia: In numbers\n \n\n   \n  Currently, the FANB has about 123,000 active personnel. The army  has 63,000, the navy 25,500, the air force 11,500 and the national guard 23,000, according to the IISS. These are supplemented by about 8,000 reservists.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to its regular military units, Venezuela can call on the Bolivarian Militia – a reserve force made up of civilians. It was created by Chávez and named after Simon Bolívar, the revolutionary who secured the independence of numerous Latin American countries from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  However, the true size of the militia is opaque. Prior to the recent US buildup, the IISS estimated its number at 220,000, but in August Maduro claimed he would deploy 4.5 million militiamen in response. Weeks later, he said he expected to call up a total of 8.2 million – though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of their training.\n \n\n   \n    Army: Loyal, but top heavy?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower:  With its 63,000 members, Venezuela’s ground forces account for the greatest chunk of its active personnel. They also have the longest history and are most politically aligned with the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Chávez, both the current interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, passed through the army – and Padrino is still an active four-star general.\n \n\n   \n  One indicator of how entwined the government and army have become is the unusual number of generals and admirals, with promotions being doled out for political loyalty. In 2019, that number was estimated at about 2,000 by Adm. Craig Faller, then chief of the US Southern Command, in a speech to the US Congress. “More than in all of NATO,” he pointed out. (In comparison, in 2025, the US had  about 850  for an armed forces 10 times larger).\n \n\n   \n  “Ecuador is a convent, Colombia is a university, and Venezuela is a barracks,” goes an old saying, attributed to Bolívar, that sums up the relationship of Venezuelans with the army.\n \n\n   \n   Weaponry:  Notable systems bought from Russia in recent years include 92 T-72B1 tanks – similar to those being used in Ukraine – and 123 BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, which equip the armored brigades alongside 81 AMX-30 tanks previously acquired from France, according to the IISS. Artillery systems include the Russian Msta-S self-propelled howitzer and Smerch rocket launchers.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿Led by:  The operational strategic commander of all of Venezuela’s armed forces is Domingo Antonio Hernández Lárez. His brother, Maj. Gen. Johan Alexander Hernández Lárez, is in charge of the army.\n \n\n   \n    Air Force: High standard\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  With 11,500 members, the Bolivarian Military Aviation, or air force, is the smallest of the country’s forces but takes pride of place due to the acquisition of Russian equipment that has set it apart among regional competitors in the Caribbean and most of Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  At the center of this arsenal are Sukhoi Su-30MK2s, high-performance twin-engine fighters that, even though developed in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, are unmatched in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-September, the FANB  shared videos  of two of its Su-30s armed with Kh-31 anti-ship missiles, also Russian-made, in a show of what remains its most advanced weapons system.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is thought to have had 24 of these planes at one point, but at least three have crashed, according to the IISS. The Venezuelan NGO Control Ciudadano says the accidents highlight “problems of system obsolescence and of maintenance and lack of spare parts.”\n \n\n   \n  The Su-30s coexist with a few old US F-16 fighters that Venezuela bought before Chávez came to power.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela also has Russian-built air defenses that include 12 batteries of long-range S-300 missiles; nine Buk systems and 44 Pechora units, both medium-range; and numerous portable Igla-S launchers, according to the IISS.\n \n\n   \n  These defenses, while advanced, would likely be the first targets of an opponent if a conflict were to break out, said Serbin Pont, the CRIES analyst.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Maj. Gen. Lenín Lorenzo Ramírez Villasmil.\n \n\n   \n    Navy: Weak point?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  The Bolivarian Navy, whose 25,500 members are tasked primarily with operations in the Caribbean, has lagged the other services in terms of arms purchases in recent decades.\n \n\n   \n  It currently operates only one Mariscal Sucre-class frigate (manufactured in Italy) and one Type-209 submarine (manufactured in Germany) in its sea fleet, according to the IISS. It also has nine oceanic and coastal patrol vessels, including four purchased from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  “The navy lost many of its assets that it had prior to (Chavez), and these were not fully replaced. The corvettes bought from Spain were never equipped with weaponry, until a few years ago when Chilean and Iranian anti-ship missiles were installed, but they do not have viable anti-aircraft defense systems,” said Serbin Pont.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Adm. Ashraf Suleimán Gutiérrez.\n \n\n   \n    And the militias?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Maduro has repeatedly played up the role of the Bolivarian Militia, formed in 2008 by Chavez to provide a loyal paramilitary force that, while technically part of the armed forces, comes directly under the control of the president.\n \n\n   \n  A definitive account of how many people belong to the Bolivarian Militia, an umbrella term for various groups that range widely in experience and ability, is hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  Days after news of the US naval deployment broke, Maduro said in August he was going to “activate … more than 4.5 million militiamen” taken from “all the factories and workplaces of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Missiles and rifles for the working class, so that they may defend our homeland,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He later suggested that the militia has more than 8 million members.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the discrepancies in number, Serbin Pont said that while there were some traditional militias composed of reservists with military experience, most of the groups showcased by the government on television and social media were too inexperienced to play a decisive fighting role.\n \n\n   \n  “Those people do not have sufficient training. There is no real armed structure to mobilize those elements, and those elements would not be effective in combat,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Their real use, Serbin Pont suggested, was serving “as an intelligence network and a repressive threat against the civilian population precisely because they are based on a network that penetrates the whole of society.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/travel/worlds-best-cheese-2025-gruyere-switzerland","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00-05:00","title":"Swiss Gruyère crowned the world’s best cheese","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the 2025 World Cheese Awards in Bern, Switzerland, aged Swiss Gruyère from Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen was crowned the world’s best cheese, winning over 265 international judges through a rigorous blind tasting process involving 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries.

world’s best cheese \n       \n  By Barry Neild, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:04 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Remember that time you had too much   cheese, felt a bit queasy and — as a greasy sheen broke out on your forehead — you lied to yourself that it was salad from now on?\n \n\n   \n  Then spare a thought for the heroic judges at this year’s World Cheese Awards, who assembled on Thursday to anoint an aged Swiss Gruyère as the best cheese in the world for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This army of 265 cheese experts from all over the planet was tasked with wading through dairy concoctions of every shape, size, color and consistency in a large auditorium in the Swiss capital Bern. In the space of a couple of hours, each judge plowed their way through at least 40 cheeses — sniffing, stroking, crumbling, and finally, tasting to arrive at a score.\n \n\n   \n  The winner was Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen, a cheese made from cow’s milk at a small dairy in the Alpine lowlands of western Switzerland. “It’s an incredible honor,” said cheesemaker Pius Hitz, shortly after picking up the top prize.\n \n\n   \n  While the win in previous years has resulted in a surge in sales for the champion cheese, Hitz said his herd of red and white Fleckvieh   cows can rest easy. A production increase is unlikely, he said, so as not to disturb the delicate balance of the protected Gruyère market.\n \n\n   \n  Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen may have only traveled a few miles to the awards, but it was still a long journey to the top. More so for its rivals, many of which had to navigate long plane rides, tricky import legislation and the US shutdown even before the contest started.\n \n\n   \n  No fewer than 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries made it to Bern’s Festhalle venue where, as judgment day wore on, they made their presence known with cascades of intensifying odors that collided with sound waves from an ensemble of Swiss horns tooting in the corner of the auditorium.\n \n\n   \n    Soft pools of goo\n \n\n   \n  The cheeses were divided up across 110 rows of white-clothed tables under the scrutiny of two- or three-person judging teams. All wearing matching yellow aprons, they were drawn from the community of makers, mongers and mavens who make up the ranks of the international cheese cognoscenti.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 10 a.m., they began the Herculean labor of trying to find bronze, silver, gold and “super gold” contenders among the milk-based marvels — stripped of identifying features so they can be blind tasted — stretching before them.\n \n\n   \n  Holes were bored in giant waxy wheels, slivers shaved from wedges, spoons dipped into soft pools of goo. In between tastings, palates were cleansed with sips of water, bites of crunchy apples and, in some cases, emergency swigs of Coca-Cola.\n \n\n   \n  There were cow, sheep, buffalo, camel and donkey milk   cheeses. Manchegos, Bries, Camemberts, cheddars, Parmesans, Goudas. Orange cheeses, blue cheeses, green cheeses. Cheeses covered in wax. Cheeses covered in flowers. At least one cheese doused in whiskey and red apple juice.\n \n\n   \n  Some were hard. Some crumbly. Some dense. Some were light and fluffy. Some were so soft they needed to be in jars. Some, their tops cut off to reveal a moist interior glistening with mold, looked as if they might teem with lifeforms as yet unknown to science.\n \n\n   \n  All were awarded points based on appearance, smell, taste, texture and the feeling it gives in the mouth — not always a pleasant experience, apparently.\n \n\n   \n  “There were a couple of no-swallows today,” said Emma Young, a UK cheesemonger and author judging the wares laid out on table 26, pointing out a cheese that she thought might have encountered problems during the making process.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t all bad.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s bonkers,” Young added. “I’ve tasted some of the best cheeses I’ve had in my life — and some of the worst. It’s been so much of a palate workout.” She pointed to a cheese that earned top marks thanks to a “complexity” she put down to the varieties of milk used.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Biting into a cloud’\n \n\n   \n  “If only it tasted as beautiful as it looks,” said Ashley Morton, a judge on table 11, where an unusually bright blue cheese, made using spirulina algae, was attracting camera phones. Morton, a “cheese ambassador” originally from New York who goes by the nickname Brieyoncé, favored a raw goat cheese coated in a gray substance that was “almost like biting into a cloud.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look at the fruit level here,” said Jen Shelton, an organic milk expert originally from Kansas, discussing a large wheel of cheese covered in pressed grapes with fellow table-52 judge Charles Beauquesne, from France. The cheese then scattered onto the table. “It’s very crumbly,” she added. “Milky, but quite dry. The grapes give it a little bit of sweetness, but it’s claggy.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair made a note of the cheese’s score, wiped down their utensils with a paper towel   and moved on to the next candidate.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, many of the judges had made their final selection, carrying “super gold” winners to a separate judging area where a team of seasoned cheese experts pared the field down to 14 finalists. These were then tasted and scored live on stage, like an aromatic “Dancing with the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  The shortlist included a Japanese soft goat’s cheese with a texture like whipped cream, a UK hard cheese the color of a deep sunset, one US cheese and, inevitably, several more Swiss cheeses. It’s widely recognized that entries from the host country have a home advantage — cheeses are not great travelers — but locals don’t always take the crown. A Gruyère won in 2022 when the contest was staged in Wales.\n \n\n   \n  John Farrand, managing director of the event’s organizers, the UK-based Guild of Fine Food, said the World Cheese Awards stand out above other dairy contests around the planet because it can claim to be truly global — staged in different countries and involving such a diverse cast of entrants and judges. In 2026, the contest will move to Córdoba in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  The winning cheese of 2025 was championed by Perry Wakeman, one of the top-level judges who normally is found aging cheese at Rennet & Rind, near Cambridge, England. The Gruyère was a worthy winner, he said, describing its complexity: “Butterscotch, caramel. Savory, some fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal. The length was unbelievable. Three cheeses on, we could still taste it.”\n \n\n   \n  For onlookers, the cheese judging could be a frustrating process. Concerns over foot and mouth disease and other agricultural health problems meant that only judges who’d signed a waiver were permitted to sample the produce under the terms of the contest’s special import license.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the day, the auditorium tables were still groaning with leftover cheese that would sadly never be eaten. The contest organizers said that the remnants don’t completely go to waste, but would be recycled locally and “turned into energy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/health/covid-vaccine-federal-recommendations-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00Z","title":"Conflicting advice on Covid shots likely to ding already low vaccine rates, experts warn","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Conflicting federal guidance from the FDA and CDC—narrowing covid vaccine eligibility and promoting shared decision-making—has fueled vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. Despite the virus being less deadly than before, vaccination rates remain low, especially among young adults, Latinos, and Black Americans.

About 75% of Americans had received  at least one dose  of the first versions of the vaccine by early 2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. But only about 23% of American adults got a covid shot during the 2024-25 virus season, well below the 47% of American adults who got a flu shot. The vaccination rates for  flu ,  measles , and tetanus are also going down.\n \n\n   \n  Yet covid remains a serious, potentially deadly health risk, listed as the primary cause of death on roughly 31,400 death certificates last year. By comparison, flu killed  about 6,500  people and pneumonia, a common complication of the flu, killed  an additional 41,600 ,  CDC data shows .\n \n\n   \n  As millions of Americans decide whether to get a covid shot this season, public health researchers worry vaccination rates will slide further, especially because Hispanic and Black Americans and those under 30 have lower rates, exposing them to serious complications such as long covid. Under the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the federal government has narrowed its recommendations on the covid vaccine, leading to a hodgepodge of rules on pharmacy access, with Americans living in Republican states often facing more barriers to getting a shot.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of misinformation is going around regarding covid,” said  Alein Haro-Ramos , an assistant professor of health, society, and behavior at the University of California-Irvine. “Vaccine hesitancy is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Food and Drug Administration  narrowed approval  for covid vaccines to those 65 or older and to adults and children with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for serious complications from covid.\n \n\n   \n  A month later, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  voted to recommend  “shared clinical decision-making” on the vaccine, pulling back from advising all adults to get vaccinated. The committee advised doctors to emphasize to adults under 65 and children that the benefits of the vaccine are greatest for those with underlying health conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance is rebutted by infectious disease experts who say most adults and children should get both the flu and covid vaccines, which are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. Several independent medical organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have reiterated their support for broad adoption of covid vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen states have taken steps to ensure most people can get a covid shot at the pharmacy without a prescription, with many states tying their policies to the advice given by medical organizations. And many of those states require insurers to cover vaccines at no cost, according to  a KFF analysis . In several other states, predominantly Republican, pharmacy access to vaccines may require a prescription.\n \n\n   \n  Among the most commonly cited reasons for covid vaccine hesitation are fears about side effects, long-term health consequences, the effectiveness of the vaccine, and mistrust of pharmaceutical corporations and government officials, according to  a 2024 review  of multiple studies, published in the journal Vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Covid vaccine hesitancy in the 2024-25 virus season was higher among Latinos; African Americans; men; uninsured people; and people living in Republican-leaning states, CDC data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Latino adults were significantly less likely than adults from most other racial and ethnic groups to get a covid shot last season, with a vaccination rate around 15%.\n \n\n   \n  Some of that may be due to age: A  disproportionate share  of Latinos are young. But public policy actions may also be a factor. The first Trump administration, for example, tied Medicaid to “public charge,” a rule allowing the federal government to deny an immigrant a green card or visa based on their dependence on taxpayer-funded programs. Some Latinos may be afraid to sign up for social services even after the Biden administration reversed those first-term Trump actions.\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos co-authored  a study  published in 2024 that found many Latinos were hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears about their immigration status, and that experiencing health discrimination like care denials or delays increased their vaccine hesitancy.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you trust the health care system, broadly speaking? Do you want to provide your information — your name, your address?” Haro-Ramos said. “Trust is critical.”\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos said the problem has likely worsened since her study was published. The Trump administration  revealed this summer  that it would give the personal information of Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many Latinos are  canceling doctor appointments  to head off possible confrontation with immigration enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  “People are avoiding leaving their homes at all costs,” Haro-Ramos said.\n \n\n   \n   Janani Rajbhandari-Thapa , an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, recently  co-authored a study  of covid vaccination among nearly 1,500 African Americans living in south Georgia. The study found that participants were more likely to listen to their health care providers than faith leaders or co-workers when seeking advice on getting vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of those studied had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but those who were unvaccinated were more likely to agree with false statements that tied vaccines to miscarriages, components’ remaining in the body for a long time, or even to the conspiracy that they implant a computer chip in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the clinicians who can take the messages about vaccination — that these are myths,” Rajbhandari-Thapa said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though covid hospitalization and death rates have fallen dramatically since the worst days of the pandemic, fatal complications related to covid remain most common among older people.  Around 89%  of U.S. covid deaths last year were among people 65 and older, compared with  about 81%  of flu and pneumonia deaths.\n \n\n   \n  As the pandemic falls into the rearview, young people have developed a sense of invincibility. Only 11% of Americans 18 to 29 received a vaccine during the 2024-25 virus season, the lowest vaccination rate among adult age groups. That’s far below the  70% of young adults  who got at least one dose of the initial covid vaccines by November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  While many people get covid after receiving a covid shot, because the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection wears off pretty fast, some misunderstand the purpose of the shot, said  Otto Yang , an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health.\n \n\n   \n  “They think, ‘Well, the vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting covid, so the vaccine didn’t work,’” Yang said. “And what they’re not seeing is that the vaccine prevented them from getting severely ill, which is ultimately the most important thing.”\n \n\n   \n  And the vaccine can help prevent long covid, which is a problem for all ages, Yang said. A recent Northwestern University study  found that  younger adults suffer worse symptoms of long covid than older adults.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Yang said, it is not a consistent choice to get a flu vaccine but forgo a covid vaccine, since both are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. It is clear, he added, that people with compromised immune systems and those at higher risk should get a covid shot. The decision is “a little bit less clear” for others but “probably most adults should be getting vaccinated, just like it’s recommended for the flu vaccine, as well as most children.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/chuy-garcia-election-gluesenkamp-perez","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"House Democrat accuses fellow Democrat of attempting to ‘anoint an heir’ in surprise floor move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a surprising move during a critical government shutdown vote, House Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez accused fellow Democrat Chuy García of attempting to 'anoint an heir' by designating his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, as the sole successor to his Illinois House seat.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington took to the floor to launch the process of sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire — which meant that his hand-picked successor was the only person registered to run for his seat.\n \n\n   \n  Gluesenkamp Perez announced on the floor that she intends to force a vote to condemn García for the move, accusing him of “undermining the process of a free and fair election.” She is using special procedural powers — known as privilege — that mean her resolution is likely to get a vote on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement after her floor speech, Gluesenkamp Perez said García is attempting to “anoint an heir.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences. Americans bled and died to secure the right to elect their leaders. We can’t expect to be taken seriously in the fight for free and fair elections if we turn a blind eye to election denial on our side of the aisle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The move by the Washington Democrat shocked her own party. Multiple members told CNN that their party — including leadership — had no idea it was coming. Some were angry, insisting that Gluesenkamp Perez was going after García at an already fragile moment for the Democratic party, which was splintered over the ending of the 43-day government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But some Democrats have also called out García for the timing of his decision not to seek reelection in a way that effectively meant no other candidate could enter the race. That includes Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey — who succeeded former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was forced out of Congress because of a corruption scandal.\n \n\n   \n  “Rep Chuy García’s decision to end his re-election at the last second and plant his chief of staff as the only candidate to succeed him was undemocratic and should not be allowed. Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim  posted on X  after Gluesenkamp Perez announced her petition on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  García announced on November 4 that he would not run again for his House seat, citing the health of his wife, the death of his daughter in 2023 and his formal adoption of his grandchild just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, filed petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections to run for the seat that same day, just ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline for filing. But the congressman had already planned not to run, according to a report by  the Chicago Sun-Times.  (Patty Garcia has no relation to the congressman.)\n \n\n   \n  The congressman addressed the criticism  in an interview  with a local Illinois political publication, Capitol Fax, saying “I think I followed the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  As for his decision, García said many in his family were “begging” him not to run again after the adoption of his grandchild and his daughter’s death two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Those were just really big factors in me deciding that I could not, in good conscience, do it again, and decided in Washington one of those nights that the only recourse we had was to look at an option. And that’s when I thought that we could try to get my chief, Patty Garcia, on the ballot,” García told Capitol Fax.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN for comment, García’s office referred to a statement in which he said he “followed every rule and every filing requirement laid out by the State of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “Congressman García made a deeply personal decision based on his health, his wife’s worsening condition and his responsibility to the grandchildren he is raising after the death of his daughter,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  And some of his colleagues have defended the congressman.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois  called  García an “an unwavering fighter for our democracy and our communities,” in response to the move to sanction him.\n \n\n   \n  “It is disappointing that someone willing to compromise working families’ healthcare would use this moment for a cheap political stunt aimed at distracting people from an indefensible vote on tonight’s CR,” she said, referring to the fact that Gluesenkamp Perez  voted in favor of the bill  to reopen the government, which did not include an extension of expiring health care subsidies – a key demand from Democrats in the funding fight.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00-05:00","title":"Wall Street has its worst day in a month as traders dial back expectations for Fed rate cuts","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced its worst day in a month on November 13, 2025, as investors reacted to the end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US stocks closed sharply lower Thursday as investors sold shares in technology companies and volatility picked up on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow fell 798 points, or 1.65%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.66% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.29%.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also assessed how long it might take for economic data releases to be rebooted after the  end of the government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The House on Wednesday evening approved a funding measure that had been passed by the Senate. The bill was signed by President Donald Trump in the late evening, officially ending the longest US government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  Now Wall Street is focused on the  backlog of government data  that was delayed because of the shutdown — and how it might impact the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Lacking fresh economic data, markets have become increasingly jittery in recent weeks,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note. “Now, as the government shutdown ends, each long-awaited data release or policy announcement will have the potential to move markets dramatically.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq each had their worst day since October 10, when a flare up in  US-China trade tensions  sent stocks lower.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Fear and Greed index  moved from “fear” into “extreme fear.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 18% as volatility picked up.\n \n\n   \n  “The gears of the government should be working again soon, and while that is a relief for markets and the economy, there is still plenty of uncertainty, particularly around the missed inflation and jobs data and how these fronts have been faring,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Traders on Thursday were pricing in roughly a 52% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 63% chance on Wednesday and a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The data blackout has made the Federal Reserve’s job difficult, but we still expect them to cut interest rates again in December,” Schleif said. “We expect markets to grind higher — though likely with continued volatility.”\n \n\n   \n  The sell-off in stocks worsened in the afternoon. The third-quarter earnings season is also winding down, meaning there are fewer fundamental catalysts, and markets are more susceptible to moves based on investor sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Tech woes continue\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors have voiced concerns about relatively expensive valuations. There has been rising skepticism about whether AI companies will be able to produce enough profits to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla shares ( TSLA ) fell 6.6%. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) fell 6.5%, and Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 3.6%. Oracle shares ( ORCL ) fell 4.15%.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are reevaluating the prices they’re paying for big tech and AI stocks,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong tech rally in recent months, investors have been taking profits and rotating into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq has dropped nearly 5% since closing at a record high on October 29. The tech-heavy index has shed almost $2 trillion in market value across that time period.\n \n\n   \n  Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he recently trimmed some of his exposure to tech.\n \n\n   \n  “It just had such a monstrous run that it just made sense to take the profits and find other opportunities,” Samana said.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow’s Thursday decline comes after back-to-back days of record highs. The blue-chip index closed above 48,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors moved into sectors including financials and health care.\n \n\n   \n  Walt Disney shares ( DIS ) fell 7.8% on Thursday after the company reported earnings that did not impress Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, bitcoin fell roughly 3.3% on Thursday and traded around $98,250. The cryptocurrency has struggled to regain ground since tumbling in recent weeks. Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Fed back in focus\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate cuts in September and October helped provide a tailwind for stocks. Investors could get spooked if central bankers hold rates steady in December due to delayed data and a cloudy view of the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “If sticky inflation forces the Fed to maintain restrictive policy, the cost of capital remains a headwind for valuations,” David Miller, CIO at Catalyst Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/28/entertainment/holiday-movies-bingo-game","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00-05:00","title":"Give Yourself the Gift of Playing Holiday Movie Bingo","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes 'Holiday movie bingo' as a light-hearted, non-controversial activity to enjoy during the Thanksgiving holiday season.

law enforcers on AI safety task force \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Artificial intelligence is playing a greater role in everything from homework to jobs and even romantic companionship — all without much oversight to guarantee the tech is being developed and used safely.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a pair of state attorneys general are teaming up with two of the biggest companies in tech to change that.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, and Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, a Republican, announced on Monday the formation of the AI Task Force. OpenAI and Microsoft have already signed on to the effort, and the attorneys general expect other state regulators and AI companies to join, too. The group will work to develop “basic safeguards” that AI developers should implement to prevent harm to users, especially children, and to identify new risks as the technology develops.\n \n\n   \n  There is no overarching federal law regulating AI, and some federal lawmakers have even sought to restrict regulation of the technology. Jackson and Brown were among the 40 attorneys general who earlier this year successfully  pushed for the removal  of an  AI regulation moratorium  from Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cuts package that could have blocked enforcement of state laws for a decade. (One federal AI law did pass this year: the  Take It Down Act , which specifically cracks down on non-consensual deepfake pornography.)\n \n\n   \n  Concerns about AI safety risks have only escalated in recent months, amid a growing  string of reports  about the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Facebook-parent Meta have also been scrambling to block young people from accessing adult content.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said he’s not hopeful Congress will move quickly to regulate AI.\n \n\n   \n  “They did nothing with respect to social media, nothing with respect for internet privacy, not even for kids, and they came very close to moving in the wrong direction on AI by handcuffing states from doing anything real,” Jackson told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of the task force announcement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the leading AI companies have begun to diverge in their approaches to safety. For example, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  said last month  that the company’s investments in child safety protections would enable it to “treat adults like adults,” including allowing verified adult users to engage in erotic conversations. Shortly after, Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  told CNN  his company would not allow sexual or romantic conversations, even for adults, and that he wanted to make “an AI you trust your kids to use” without a separate, young user experience.\n \n\n   \n  “This effort reflects a shared commitment to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while working collaboratively with stakeholders to understand and mitigate unintended consequences,” Kia Floyd, Microsoft’s general manager of state government affairs, said in a statement on joining the task force. “By partnering with state leaders and industry peers, we can promote innovation and consumer protection to ensure AI serves the public good.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever guardrails the task force develops will technically be voluntary. But the group will have another benefit, too: bringing states’ top law enforcement officers together to track AI developments and risks, potentially making it easier for them to take joint legal action if tech companies harm consumers. That makes this effort different from “a group of think tanks coming together” to create AI safety principles, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson would still like Congress to pass more AI legislation. But, he said, “Congress has left a vacuum and I think it makes sense for AGs to try to fill it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/toy-story-5-teaser-watch-now","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-05:00","title":"Screens are the enemy in new ‘Toy Story 5’ teaser trailer","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The new teaser trailer for 'Toy Story 5' explores the growing threat of digital technology to traditional toys, with a frog-framed tablet named Lilypad being delivered to Bonnie Anderson, a girl who inherited Andy’s toys from 'Toy Story 3.'

 By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:18 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A self-styled clairvoyant who said a statue of the Virgin Mary cried tears of blood and claimed she could multiply gnocchi for her followers, has been charged with fraud, along with her husband. They are due to stand trial in April.\n \n\n   \n  For years, faithful Catholic pilgrims flocked to a field outside Rome, belonging to Gisella Cardia – born Maria Giuseppa Scarpulla – and her husband Gianni Cardia, to pray in front of the statue of the Madonna of Trevignano. The statue was said to weep blood and transmit messages Gisella Cardia claimed were both from God and Satan, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who have been denounced by the Vatican, created a shrine to the Madonna statuette and regularly held prayer events, during which Gisella Cardia would take to the stage and preach.\n \n\n   \n  Her followers have told media that, although Gisella Cardia did not multiply bread and loaves, she would often show up with one box of pizza or a plate of gnocchi that somehow multiplied to feed the masses.\n \n\n   \n  The couple also collected nearly €400,000 ($465,000) between 2018 and 2024 from those who came to pray in front of the statue, promising that the money would go to children’s hospital, the prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia, which has charged them with fraud, confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor’s office has alleged that the money was used to spruce up the pilgrimage site and for a $40,000 car, and was not taxed in accordance with religious donations.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who will face trial in April, are accused of staging “apparitions” to make it seem that blood was flowing from the Madonna statue’s eyes for money.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged scam came to light in 2023 after a former follower contacted police. In an interview with state broadcaster RAI, he said he told officers that he’d found a coffin in his car following an alleged confrontation with Gisella Cardia.\n \n\n   \n  Police launched an investigation, testing the blood which turned out to match Gisella Cardia’s DNA, geneticist Emiliano Giardina of the public prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia said in a court report.\n \n\n   \n  At that time,  the Vatican  released a statement warning pilgrims to be wary of “the alleged apparitions and revelations reported by Mrs. Gisella Cardia… and by Mr. Gianni Cardia,” which it said had been judged to be  not supernatural .\n \n\n   \n  The couple’s lawyer Solange Marchignoli told CNN Thursday: “(Gisella) Cardia is relieved, as she believes this moment represents an opportunity to transparently reveal the truth of the facts and to definitively put an end to all forms of speculation, misunderstanding, and controversy that have, despite herself, involved her in recent months.” Marchignoli added that the couple “welcomed the trial and said it would be a necessary step to finally clarify, in the appropriate venues, every aspect of the case involving her.”\n \n\n   \n  One woman told a local news channel in an interview later broadcast by RAI that she witnessed Gisella Cardia multiplying pizza.\n \n\n   \n  “We were at her house for a rosary, and there were about 20 or 25 of us. After the rosary, we decided to stay there for a while to talk. At one point, someone brought a box of pizza. A person near us cut it and each of us went over there and took a little piece at a time… We all ate it. The pizza was never ending and this is all the work of Divine Providence through Gisella,” the woman said.\n \n\n   \n  Gisella Cardia herself also recounted a similar instance in an interview with La Repubblica newspaper when allegations of into fraud first surfaced in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “There was lunch left over, consisting of gnocchi and a bit of rabbit,” she said. “Everyone ate the gnocchi and rabbit, 15 people, and it’s incredible. While I was dishing out the gnocchi, the food didn’t get any smaller, nor did the pot.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-execution-wood","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:18:00-05:00","title":"Oklahoma Governor Spares the Life of Inmate Just Before He Was to Be Executed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt commuted the death sentence of Tremane Wood to life in prison without parole just before a scheduled lethal injection, citing a recommendation from the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board.

Kevin Stitt has spared the life of a death row inmate just before he was set to receive a lethal injection on Thursday, commuting the man’s sentence to life in prison without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt formally granted clemency to Tremane Wood, 46, who was scheduled to die for the stabbing death of a man during a botched robbery in 2002. It is just the second time the Republican governor has granted clemency during his nearly seven years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation to commute Tremane Wood’s sentence to life without parole,” Stitt announced.\n \n\n   \n  “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” the governor said.\n \n\n   \n  In his executive order commuting Wood’s sentence, Stitt says Wood shall not be eligible to apply for or be considered for a commutation, pardon or parole for the rest of his life.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt previously granted clemency to  death row inmate Julius Jones  in 2021, but had rejected clemency recommendations in four other cases. A total of 16 men have been executed during Stitt’s time in office.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment with the governor’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I am disappointed that the governor has granted clemency for this dangerous murderer, but respect that this was his decision to make,” Drummond said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Wood was scheduled to die for his role in the killing of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farmworker from Montana, during an attempted robbery at a north Oklahoma City hotel early on New Year’s Day in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves, said she and her legal team are “profoundly grateful” for Stitt’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace,” her statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Wipf grew up in a Hutterite religious community in Montana, and his family and the surviving victim of the attack supported his clemency, Castro Alves said.\n \n\n   \n  George Burnett, one of the original prosecutors, said he’s concerned that a five-member parole board can have such a profound impact on a case that has been litigated for more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “Ronnie Wipf is buried on a lonely hill somewhere on the plains of Montana, and when his family visits him, they wonder what might have been,” Burnett said.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma’s Pardon and Parole Board  voted 3-2 last week  to recommend that the governor grant clemency.\n \n\n   \n  During the clemency hearing, Wood’s attorneys didn’t deny that he participated in the robbery but maintained that his brother, Zjaiton Wood, was the one who actually stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood was sentenced to life without parole. Before he died in prison in 2019, he admitted to several people that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.\n \n\n   \n  Castro Alves told the panel Tremane Wood had an ineffective trial attorney who was drinking heavily at the time and who did little work on the case. She also said trial prosecutors improperly concealed from jurors the benefits that witnesses received in exchange for their testimony. Wood’s attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution on these grounds, but were denied.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while in prison, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering attacks on other inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Wood, who testified to the panel via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but denied being the one who killed Wipf.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a monster. I’m not a killer. I never was and I never have been,” Wood said.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorneys also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution, but the court denied that request early Thursday. His attorneys had argued, among other things, that trial prosecutors didn’t properly reveal details of a plea agreement with a key witness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/gorsuch-children-book-declaration-of-independence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00-05:00","title":"Justice Gorsuch to co-author children’s book about the Declaration of Independence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Justice Neil Gorsuch has announced that he will co-author a children's book titled 'Heroes of 1776: The Story of The Declaration of Independence' with Janie Nitze, to be published by HarperCollins in May 2025, marking the 250th anniversary of the document’s signing.

Independence, a departure from the headier book the conservative jurist authored last year that  targeted burdensome government  regulations.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be titled “Heroes of 1776: The Story of The Declaration of Independence” and is set to publish in May, which Gorsuch indicated is timed to correspond to the 250th anniversary of the document’s signing.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the next year we’ll celebrate a lot of dates and events with fireworks and   I wanted to share with children some stories about the courage and sacrifice of the heroes behind 1776 who gave us our Constitution and our liberties,” Gorsuch told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be published by HarperCollins.\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch, who was President Donald Trump’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, published a decidedly adult book just last year that lamented out-of-control government bureaucracies and told the stories of Americans he said had been hampered by overzealous regulations and red tape.\n \n\n   \n  In that book, Gorsuch told the story a commercial fisherman in Florida who was threatened with a 20-year prison sentence for tossing undersized grouper overboard – a case that was decided by  the Supreme Court  in 2015. He also wrote about Marty Hahne, a Missouri magician who became a  cause célèbre for anti-regulation advocates   a decade ago when the US Department of Agriculture required him to draft an emergency disaster plan for Casey, a rabbit he pulled out of a hat at his shows.\n \n\n   \n  In June,  Gorsuch reported receiving a little over $250,000 in book royalties  – a roughly equal amount to what he reported a year before. Supreme Court justices, who earn more than $300,000 a year, are barred from receiving more than about $30,000 in outside income annually. But book revenue is exempt from that policy, creating an incentive for the nine to put pen to paper beyond their opinions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, has authored several children’s books, including one this year. Sotomayor reported nearly $134,000 in book-related income in her most recent financial disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett both zigzagged across the country this fall promoting new books.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh is working on book now. So is Justice  Samuel Alito .\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch is writing the book with Janie Nitze, who also co-authored Gorsuch’s book last year. It will be illustrated by Chris Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  In a promotional statement, HarperCollins said the new book would “dive into the stories of ordinary people willing to do extraordinary things” around the time of nation’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to know our shared history, and I think if we do that we’ll come to realize that all the things that separate us pale in comparison to the things that unite us,” Gorsuch told Fox. “I wanted to be part of America’s celebration and bringing us together again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/trump-administration-designates-european-antifa-groups-terrorists","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Trump administration designates four European Antifa groups as terrorists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has designated four European Antifa groups — Antifa Ost, FAI/FRI, Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice — as Specially Designated Global Terrorists and foreign terrorist organizations, placing them in the same category as ISIS-K and al-Shabaab.

    2:34 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has  designated  four European Antifa groups as terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday he was classifying four groups in Germany, Italy, and Greece as Specially Designated Global Terrorists and intends to designate them as foreign terrorist organizations effective next week.\n \n\n   \n  The designations put the groups – Antifa Ost, Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI), Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice – in the same category with groups like ISIS-K and al-Shabaab.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes  amid a push  by President Donald Trump to target the Antifa movement, which often leans to the political left and lacks centralized structure or defined leadership.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump signed an order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and directing federal agencies to take action against it.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio on Thursday accused Antifa groups of ascribing to “revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, ‘anti-capitalism,’ and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas.”\n \n\n   \n  According to a State Department fact sheet, Germany-based Antifa Ost conducted attacks on individuals it deemed as “fascists” in Germany between 2018 and 2023 “and is accused of having conducted a series of attacks in Budapest in mid-February 2023.” It was designated as a terrorist organization in Hungary earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “FAI/FRI has claimed responsibility for threats of violence, bombs, and letter bombs against political and economic institutions, including a courthouse and other ‘capitalist institutions,’” the State Department fact sheet said.\n \n\n   \n  The fact sheet said Revolutionary Class Self-Defense had “claimed responsibility for two IED attacks targeting the Greece Ministry of Labor (February 3, 2024) and the Hellenic Train offices (April 11, 2025),” and that Armed Proletarian Justice “claimed responsibility for planting a bomb near the Greek riot police headquarters in Goudi, Greece on December 18, 2023.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result of the designations, any assets in the US from the groups will be blocked, and Americans are prohibited from “knowingly” providing material support to them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sean “Diddy” Combs will be staying in prison at least one month longer than he thought.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Prisons pushed Combs’ release date to June 4, 2028, according to the agency’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ original release date – first reported in October, more than three months after a jury delivered a mixed verdict in his federal trial – had been scheduled for May 8, 2028.\n \n\n   \n  No explanation was given by the Bureau of Prisons for the pushed back date  and representatives couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The change could reflect an updated calculation or punishment if an infraction, if any, occurred.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ spokesman Juda Engelmayer told CNN they have not been given an explanation for the changed date yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still trying to find out what the dates mean and why and what the issue is, if there is one” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs was accepted into the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program, known as RDAP, at the low security prison in Fort Dix, NJ. Inmates who participate in the program often receive credits that can reduce time from their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “His only goal is he wants to work on himself, do better, be better, and get back to his family and be the father that they need. He’s not going to do anything to hurt that,” Engelmayer said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs had been sentenced to 50 months (roughly more than four years) by a judge after a two-month trial ended with him being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs was acquitted by a jury of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering for which he was facing decades and possibly life in prison if convicted.\n \n\n   \n  He has already served 13 months in jail and that will be credited to his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  He had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest. In late  October , Combs was transferred on Thursday to  Fort Dix , a low-security federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is appealing his conviction and sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ defense previously told CNN that they had approached President Donald Trump’s administration about a potential pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ attorney Nicole Westmoreland  told CNN  in August that it was her “understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon.” At the time, a White House official told CNN they “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any clemency request.”\n \n\n   \n  In October after Combs’ sentencing, Trump confirmed that Combs had requested a presidential pardon in connection with his federal criminal case,  telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins  “a lot of people have asked me for pardons,” including Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously indicated that he was unlikely to pardon Combs during an  interview  with Newsmax, saying, “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.” Trump said that this made pardoning Combs “more difficult to do.”\n \n\n   \n  During his trial, Combs’ defense admitted to his pattern of violent behavior against women with whom he was in romantic relationships over the years. The jury was repeatedly shown footage — first published in 2024 by CNN — of Combs violently beating his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016. The jury was also shown images of bloody gashes and bruises on Ventura’s body during trial.\n \n\n   \n  Ventura was the star witness of the case and testified that she was repeatedly abused by Combs and forced to take drugs and have sex with other men against her will throughout their 10-year relationship, during which he controlled her career and finances. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” also recounted psychological, financial and physical abuse by Combs who she said forced her to have sex with other men while she was under the influence of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  At his sentencing, judge Arun Submaranian  admonished Combs  for his abuse and rejected the defense’s “attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate consensual experiences or just a sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll story.” Submaranian said that the prosecution’s case “showed that (Combs) abused the power and control (he) had over the women (he) professed to love dearly.”\n \n\n   \n  “You abused them physically, emotionally and psychologically and you used that abuse to get your way,” he said, addressing Combs. “This was subjugation, and it drove both Ms. Ventura and Jane to thoughts of ending their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs is also facing roughly 70 civil lawsuits where most of the dozens of accusers — some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged incidents — claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs has denied all of the civil claims. Some of the lawsuits have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.

The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n    November 6\n \n\n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, killing three people, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters,” Hegseth said in a  post on X , adding that US forces were not harmed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n    November 9\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific according, to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n    November 10\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon conducted  its 20th strike   on an alleged drug trafficking boat on November 10, a Defense Department official said on November 13.\n \n\n   \n  “The strike occurred in the Caribbean and four narco-terrorists were killed, no survivors,” the official confirmed in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/401k-ira-contribution-limits-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"401(k), IRA contribution limits get a bump up","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The IRS has announced cost-of-living adjustments to federal retirement savings limits for 2026, increasing 401(k), 403(b), 457, and Thrift Savings Plan contribution limits to $24,500, with catch-up contributions rising to $8,000 for those aged 50 and over and $11,250 for those aged 60–63.

bump up \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:20 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you plan to max out your contributions to your 401(k) or IRA next year, you will get to save a little more than you could this year.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS on Thursday announced cost-of-living adjustments to federal contribution limits for 2026 for key retirement savings vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  401(k) participants will be allowed to   put away up to $24,500 next year, a $1,000 increase from the current limit. The same increase will apply to 403(b)s, governmental 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone 50 or older in those plans can save more. Next year the so-called “catch-up contribution” limit rises to $8,000 from $7,500, for a total of $32,500. But those who are ages 60, 61, 62, and 63 may save even more – up to an additional $11,250, which is the same limit as this year, for a total of $35,750.\n \n\n   \n  There is another change, however, for the highest-earning older savers. Starting in 2026, if in the prior year you made more than $145,000 in FICA wages — that is income subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes — any catch-up contributions you make will  automatically be subject to income tax . So they essentially will be treated as  Roth 401(k)  contributions.\n \n\n   \n    New savings and income limits for traditional and Roth IRAs\n \n\n   \n  If you are eligible to put money into a tax-deductible IRA or an after- tax Roth IRA, you will be allowed to save up to $7,500, which is $500 more than you can sock away this year.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit if you’re at least 50 will be $1,100, up from $1,000 today.\n \n\n   \n  The income thresholds to determine whether you’re eligible to save in those IRA vehicles are also being adjusted.\n \n\n   \n  Those thresholds differ based both on your marital status and whether or not you’re covered by a retirement savings plan at work. (Here are the IRS’ new  income threshold breakdowns  across those categories.)\n \n\n   \n    Limits for Saver’s Credit and SIMPLE Accounts also change\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a low- or moderate-income worker, you may be eligible for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, also known as the  Saver’s Credit . It’s essentially a government-provided match on at least a portion of your retirement contributions to an IRA or workplace retirement plan. The credit, which won’t change next year, is worth up to $1,000 for single filers; and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n \n\n   \n  To qualify in 2026, your income may not exceed $40,250 if you’re a single filer or married filing separately, which is up $750 from this year’s income limit. If you file as head of household, your income may not be more than $60,375, up $1,125 compared to this year. And it may not top $80,500 if you’re married filing jointly, up $1,500.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re employed by a small business offering a  SIMPLE IRA  at work and put retirement savings into a SIMPLE account, you may save up to $17,000 next year, up from $16,500 today; although for some types of SIMPLE accounts the contribution limit rises to $18,100, up from $17,600.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit will be increased to $4,000 from $3,500 currently. Savers who are between the ages of 60 and 63 may contribute an additional $5,250, which is the same as this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97660","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"Can you ace this week's test?

But even in a state that went for Trump by 16 percentage points in 2024, Republicans could not rally enough support this fall for a special session on redistricting. \"I haven't heard a good reason yet to vote for it,\" said Mark Schreiber, one of 10 Republican holdouts in the Kansas state House. \"To me that's not the purpose of redistricting. It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority, it's to adjust for population changes.\" Other Republican-led states — like  Missouri ,  North Carolina  and  Texas  — have heeded Trump's call for new congressional maps boosting the GOP. Last week, California voters  approved new districts  favoring Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Kansas' false start was just one example of lawmakers pushing back against a new round of partisan gerrymanders. On Friday afternoon, Indiana's state Senate president  announced  there wasn't enough support for redistricting among the chamber's Republicans. Democrats in Maryland have faced scorn from party leaders for speaking out against proposed redraws. And in Ohio, where many expected Republicans to enact a severe gerrymander,  a bipartisan deal  resulted in a map that moderately advantaged the GOP. Why do some lawmakers oppose redistricting that would help their party? Lawmakers' reasons for bucking their party leaders appear to vary widely, including those who object to gerrymandering on philosophical grounds — and some who simply fear the maneuvers could backfire. \"The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state,\" said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Miller said some states, like New York and Colorado, have filing deadlines for congressional candidates that place an impossibly short timeline on potential redistricting efforts, given the steps needed in the states to craft a new map. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana raised eyebrows at the six-figure sums required to pay legislators outside of a regular session. Republican leaders in Kansas also faced a unique challenge. The state GOP would need to marshal nearly the full strength of its supermajorities in the state House and Senate to override a veto from the Democratic governor. Overall, Miller said, opposition to redistricting has not necessarily come from a place of righteous objection to gerrymandering. \"I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about … redistricting,\" Miller said. \"But I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all.\" Kansas state Rep. Clark Sanders said gerrymandering is a \"fact of life\" in politics. But he opposed hastily redrawing Kansas' 3rd District — held by the state's lone Democrat in Congress, Sharice Davids — because he thought it could backfire on Republicans. \"If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the 2nd District,\" he said. Sanders said he expressed the same concern when he received a call from the White House several weeks ago, to talk about redistricting. Last week, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped Sanders of a leadership position for refusing to sign off on a special session. He was one of seven committee chairs and vice chairs who were demoted for failing to toe the party line on redistricting. \"It's unfortunate that we lost our positions,\" Sanders said. \"We just … felt like we needed to do what we needed to do.\" Similar objections have sparked infighting in other states. Maryland's state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, has stood in opposition to his governor by publicly opposing redistricting. Ferguson  has argued  a legal challenge could place redistricting in the hands of the conservative-leaning state Supreme Court — resulting in new maps that hurt Democrats, rather than giving them a leg up. \"Ready to ride\" Despite those setbacks, redistricting proponents in several states are still trying to convince holdouts — under the watchful eyes of the national parties. Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore  recently formed  a redistricting advisory commission, despite state Sen. Ferguson's pushback.  And Kansas Republican leaders have  vowed to put maps before lawmakers  when their regular session begins in January. \"I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,\" House Speaker Hawkins wrote in a newsletter after his chamber rejected a special session. When lawmakers return to Topeka early next year, he said, \"House Republicans will be ready to ride.\" Even some holdouts in Kansas, like Republican state Rep. Adam Smith, said they had not ruled out the possibility of voting to redistrict in the future. \"If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   President Trump set off a redistricting arms race this summer when he called on Texas to redraw its congressional map to favor Republicans. That battle has spread to several other states, including California and Missouri. But lawmakers in some states are pushing back. Zane Irwin of the Kansas News Service reports. ZANE IRWIN, BYLINE: These days, the White House must be wondering, what's the matter with Kansas? Republican leaders in the Sunflower State want to follow President Trump's call to redraw congressional maps mid decade. But even in a state that Trump carried by 16 points last year, those legislative leaders recently failed to gather enough support for a special session on redistricting. MARK SCHREIBER: I haven't heard a good reason yet to vote for it. IRWIN: That's Mark Schreiber, a Republican from Emporia in eastern Kansas. He's one of 10 Republican state representatives who opposed a special session to redraw the map. SCHREIBER: To me, that's not the purpose of redistricting. It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority. It's to adjust for population changes. IRWIN: Kansas Republican leaders say they want to help preserve the slim GOP majority in the U.S. House to bolster Trump's agenda. That would mean targeting Sharice Davids, the only Democrat representing the state in Congress. But that effort has stalled, and lawmakers in other states are also bucking their party leaders on redistricting. Today, Indiana's state Senate president scrapped plans to consider redrawing the maps in December, saying there's not enough support in his chamber, and the Democratic state Senate president in Maryland has also dug in his heels against redistricting. Patrick Miller is a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio. He says there's probably not one reason why some states are hitting redistricting roadblocks. PATRICK MILLER: The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state. IRWIN: Some lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana chafed at the six-figure sums that special sessions would have cost. Other states have candidate filing deadlines that make redistricting difficult. Overall, Miller says the reasons lawmakers have for breaking with their parties might be more logistical than philosophical. MILLER: I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about something with redistricting, but I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all. IRWIN: Kansas representative Clarke Sanders says gerrymandering is a fact of life, but he opposed redistricting in Kansas because he thought it could backfire on Republicans. The House speaker stripped him of leadership position for that stance, yet Sanders maintains that carving up the third district could be risky. CLARKE SANDERS: If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the second district. IRWIN: And some state lawmakers have also gotten pushback from voters. Republican representative Adam Smith says some constituents still remember the last time the maps were redrawn in 2022. ADAM SMITH: I'm out here in northwest Kansas, and there were a lot of rural conservatives that were pretty upset with western Kansas getting drawn in with some blue areas. IRWIN: Despite some setbacks, redistricting proponents in some states are still trying to convince holdouts. In Kansas, republican leaders have vowed to put maps before lawmakers when their regular session begins in January. And legislators who opposed the special session, like Smith, say they're keeping an open mind. SMITH: If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that. IRWIN: The White House will be watching Kansas and other Republican-led states to see if holdouts come over to their side with the balance of power in Congress at stake.

Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is upending its homelessness policy, with deep cuts to funding for long-term housing. Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said  the new policies  will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing  Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that. In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups. The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled. \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement. The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments. \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement. The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets. But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels. Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an  executive order he signed in July , which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction. \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer. \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own. There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help. \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles. For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   In a major shift, the Trump administration is moving away from long-term housing for homelessness. Instead, it will ramp up funding for transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. Critics warn that this could push many people back on the streets. NPR's Jennifer Ludden has been covering this and joins us now. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: OK, so we have been hearing President Trump weigh in a lot on homelessness this year. Can you just tell us more about what this change would mean exactly? LUDDEN: Yeah, this does reflect an executive order President Trump signed this summer, but it goes a lot further. It's about a dramatic shift in how to spend nearly $4 billion in homelessness funding. That's an overall amount that is up from last year. The federal housing agency HUD says the idea is to promote self-sufficiency and get at root causes of homelessness, which it says are specifically addiction and mental illness, very common among those living outside. Now, the changes are a rebuke to longstanding federal policy. It's called Housing First. And under that, the vast majority of this funding has long gone to permanent housing that offers people treatment, but it doesn't require it. There's been a real backlash building as homelessness has spiked to record highs, according to annual federal accounts. I spoke with Stephen Eide who's with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. He's argued for a long time that these permanent housing projects are not the answer. STEPHEN EIDE: It turned out that the units were so expensive. They cost hundreds of thousands of dollars individually, and they took years and years to bring online. And so it was just oversold. LUDDEN: Now, Eide says with this change, it will be quicker and cheaper to ramp up shorter-term transitional housing, and that with mandated treatment, many could become self-sufficient. CHANG: But this is a pretty major overhaul, right? Like, what do advocacy groups who work on homelessness say about this idea? LUDDEN: They largely do not agree at all. I spoke with Ann Oliva. She heads the National Alliance to End Homelessness, and she used to manage HUD's homelessness programs. She says people in the agency's permanent housing need that help, and they need it long term. And her group and others calculate that shifting most money away from these kind of programs could lead as many as 170,000 people to lose housing all over again. ANN OLIVA: Those are people who have overcome homelessness, people who are seniors, who have disabling conditions. It's going to disadvantage those folks, but it also disadvantages communities really significantly because they are being expected to make massive, massive changes in a very short period of time. LUDDEN: And what she means there is these changes are part of a notice to apply for funding, and it's coming much later in the year than usual. Now, some programs are actually slated to run out of money before this new funding would start up. CHANG: Whoa. OK, so then what happens next at this point? LUDDEN: I think next, it is a big scramble, you know, for applying for this funding and also figuring out who can apply to these new qualifications. Advocates say you can't just easily switch from Housing First to transitional, and in many cases, that's just not realistic. Also, the agency will now favor places and programs that comply with the Trump administration's policy agenda, like the president's rollback of DEI and push for homeless camping bans. And finally, in the past, a lot of this funding has basically rolled over to existing projects. But now HUD says only 30% of grants will be automatically renewed. It wants the process to be more competitive with new players at the table. So that's another way that programs who are now housing formerly homeless people could suddenly lose their funding in coming months. CHANG: That is NPR's Jennifer Ludden. Thank you, Jennifer. LUDDEN: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599558","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-06","timeOfPublication":"15:23:00-05:00","title":"After California's vote to counter Trump, here's where redistricting stands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters have approved a new congressional district map that could help Democrats gain five additional seats in the U.S. House, marking a significant countermove to President Trump’s campaign to reshape voting maps in favor of Republicans. Trump has pushed for redistricting in key states like Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, and others, where Republicans have already gained seats, aiming to protect his party's House majority and shield himself from investigations. While Republicans have gained ground in several states, including Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, resistance remains in states like Kansas and Ohio, and legal challenges—including those in Texas and possible Supreme Court rulings—could alter outcomes.

redistricting stands \n         By Larry Kaplow \n        \n           Thursday, November 6, 2025 • 3:23 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         California voters this week made the biggest Democratic move yet against President Trump's effort to reshape voting maps in favor of Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. They  overwhelmingly approved a map  for congressional districts that could help Democrats win five more seats in the U.S. House. The ballot language itself referred to Texas, where Trump  convinced Republican leaders to draw new lines  this summer aimed at turning five seats for his party. States usually redistrict at the start of the decade following the decennial census. But Trump has set off a redistricting race across the country, saying that keeping the Republican advantage in the U.S. House, now just a few seats, is key to his agenda. It also would continue to protect him from investigations by a Democratic-led House. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So far, the GOP has gained an edge in five seats in Texas,  one in Missouri , one in North Carolina and a  potential net gain  of one to two  in Ohio . That means the GOP could pick up nine or so seats in the midterms next year, with the potential to pick up another four or five if Republicans in Indiana, Kansas, Florida or Louisiana decide to redistrict. But that scenario could change if court challenges prevail, among other factors. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted five seats their way in California. And, a sixth in Utah seems likely to move toward Democrats. In Virginia, Democrats have started a process that could result in two or three seats. Maryland and Illinois might add one seat each — but Democrats haven't decided to go for them yet. Overall, Democrats have fewer options than Republicans. How does redistricting work again? There are 435 members of the U.S. House representing about 760,000 people each. Every 10 years, as populations change, the national census shows how many seats each state gets and the states draw new district maps. However people vote, the way their votes are divided up into districts can determine how many seats are won by Republican or Democratic candidates. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gerrymandering is when the party in power draws the lines to favor a party or group. Gerrymandering for political advantage is legal in many states. But as a result, voters can see their votes weakened and their districts become less competitive, which can lead to a   more polarized, gridlocked Congress . It's illegal to gerrymander to dilute the voting power of a racial group. That's often done by \"cracking\" communities into different districts or \"packing\" them together into one district. But partisan gerrymandering sometimes overlaps with racial gerrymandering. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has lots of places to go for Republican advantages Trump's calls for redistricting come as his party faces a tough trend next year. In the last five midterm elections, the party that held the White House   has lost seats  in the U.S. House. In the states, a party typically needs control of the legislature to redistrict for its political gain, and Republicans have that in more states than Democrats do. Since Texas redistricted, Trump has brought Republican lawmakers from Indiana and Kansas to the White House to make the case and urged Florida to follow. Louisiana Republicans are considering their options. Some Republicans have stopped short of granting Trump's wish. Ohio Republicans could force a lopsided redistricting this year, when the state's current maps expire, but so far they've struck a deal with Democrats for fairly marginal changes. Kansas Republicans say they don't have enough votes from their own party to pass redistricting in the legislature — yet. It's worth noting that lawsuits may factor in. A Texas judge is considering a case after a trial there and Republicans have sued in California. And a case before the U.S. Supreme Court could loosen laws against racial gerrymandering and end up favoring Republican redistricting. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Aside from California, Democratic-led states are just starting to take steps Democrats' options are more limited. They control fewer legislatures, and in states where they do, there tend to be more restrictions around redistricting. Some Democratic-led states, including California,  and fewer  Republican ones, have commissions in various forms designed to reduce political influence on the process. That's why it took a public vote to sideline the commission and redraw lines in California. Other Democratic states have lengthy constitutional or legal steps required to redistrict. New York can't complete the redistricting process in time for 2026. Virginia Democratic lawmakers voted to start a process aimed at flipping a couple seats, but redistricting there would still require another vote by them in January and then it would go to voters. Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker says he hasn't ruled out redistricting but in that state Republicans already only hold three of 17 seats. Maryland could redistrict, but that state only has one Republican seat. Both states are under pressure from Democrats to do what they can. As Republicans point out as evidence of partisan gerrymandering, some Democratic-majority states have barely any districts represented by Republicans in the first place. Massachusetts has nine Democrats in its nine seats. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97936","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00-05:00","title":"Trump scraps tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruit in a push to lower prices","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump announced a significant rollback of U.S. tariffs on key consumer goods including beef, coffee, tropical fruits, tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, and certain fertilizers, in response to public and political pressure over high consumer prices and inflation.

fruit in a push to lower prices \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 9:22 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,\" Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, \"I say they may, in some cases\" have that effect. \"But to a large extent they've been borne by other countries,\" the president added. Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump's pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren't a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday's move as an acknowledgement that Trump's policies were hurting American pocketbooks. \"President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,\" Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. \"After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters' fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a 'pivot to affordability.'\" Grocery bill worries Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don't increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren't produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump's move to provide \"swift tariff relief,\" noting that import U.S. taxes \"are an important factor\" in a \"complex mix\" of supply chain issues. \"President Trump's proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,\" the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he'd since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Indeed, Friday's announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. \"Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,\" the president said then. \"We're going to have some coffee come in.\" Tariff checks? Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, \"Sometime during the year.\" Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. \"This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,\" Trump said. \"Everybody but the rich will get this. That's not made up. That's real money. That comes from other countries.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel features a curated collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, presenting intimate, live music performances in an accessible and prominent format.

      \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         It was 2012 when  Love Dalén , a paleogeneticist at Stockholm University, first laid eyes upon a special specimen on a lab table in eastern Siberia. \"Our Russian collaborators said, 'Come here into this room,'\" he recalls. \"We walked in and there's this dead mammoth lying there. It doesn't look like it died yesterday, but you can't believe your eyes because it's so well preserved. It's a kind of holy hell moment when you see this.\" The animal had been found thawing out of a permafrost cliff near the Siberian coastline — not quite the entire body of a juvenile mammoth that lived during the last Ice Age some 39,000 years ago. It had remained buried and frozen for millennia. Now, in a paper published in the journal  Cell , Dalén and his colleagues report that they managed to extract something remarkable from that ancient mammoth — RNA, the molecule that translates genes into proteins and which tends to degrade rapidly. The results offer a glimpse into what was happening inside this ancient mammoth's cells when it died. The molecules that maketh a mammoth The Russians named the animal — which they believed to be a female based on visual inspection — Yuka. \"It does have deep scratch marks on its hindquarters,\" says Dalén. \"It either was attacked by cave lions while it was alive, probably chasing it down, or maybe cave lions were scavenging on it after it had died.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over the years, various researchers had studied and sequenced Yuka's DNA, \"which is kind of a recipe for how to make a mammoth,\" explains Dalén. (That DNA contains genes, which carry instructions for building specific proteins.) But he and his collaborators wondered about the mammoth's  RNA  — the flurry of little messenger molecules that translate that recipe into the building and operating of an actual mammoth. \"The RNA molecules instruct the cells how and when to make proteins,\" says Dalén. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most every cell in an organism's body has the same DNA. And yet — depending on where they are and what they do in the body — those cells can look and behave differently from one another. \"What makes these cells different is the RNA activity in them, which genes are turned on and off,\" he says. \"That is what separates liver cells from muscle cells and so on.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The whole set of RNAs contained in a cell at a given time point is very much dynamic [and] can also quickly change in response to many factors, like stress, daytime, feeding, sleep, contaminants, infections, etc,\" says  Emilio Mármol Sánchez , a geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen. Dalén, Sánchez, and their team figured that if they could get RNA out of that ancient mammoth, they'd have a snapshot of the genes that were in use around the moment when it died. The only problem was that RNA doesn't usually hang around for very long. RNA tends to survive mere minutes or hours — generally not millennia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It felt like a very high-risk project,\" says Dalén. \"It seemed like a completely crazy thing to try to do.\" Still, there have been a smattering of studies that have turned up ancient RNA. \"So we knew that there was a chance, if we had some really well-preserved samples, to get this to work,\" he says. RNA reveal party Dalén and his colleagues collected tissue samples from ten different mammoths, including Yuka, and painstakingly worked to extract RNA. The resulting fragments were all very short, either because they were small to begin with or because, despite being frozen, they had broken down with time. Then came the challenging task of piecing those segments together, validating that they really were mammoth RNA. \"The big bulk of the work is on the computational side to make sense of all these gigabytes of data,\" says Dalén. On the other end of that analysis was something unmistakable, he says — woolly mammoth RNA. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most of it was too fragmented to know what it was or where it came from, but three of the mammoths had sufficient material to analyze. That included Yuka, whose muscle had been sampled. The resulting RNA was related to slow-twitch muscle function and development. That was a reassuring confirmation but not surprising. The team also found RNA that would have been produced in response to some kind of stress. \"That would be consistent with an animal being chased down by cave lions, but of course there could also be other explanations,\" says Dalén. \"If you get stuck in mud, your muscles would be stressed out from trying to get out. So we can say that the muscles were stressed at the point of death, but we don't really know why.\" In addition, some of Yuka's RNA came from a Y chromosome. A closer look at the animal's DNA confirmed it had one X and one Y chromosome. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Genetically, Yuka was definitely a male,\" says Dalén. \"In theory, Yuka could have developed as a female. But more likely those critical morphological parts were missing when they did the visual inspection, let's put it that way.\" All told, Dalén says the results are a stunning proof of principle — that it's possible to know which genes were active in a now-extinct animal. \"You're actually seeing processes going on inside the cells right around the time it died,\" he says. \"And these processes have then been frozen in time for 40,000 years.\" Maanasa Raghavan , a paleogeneticist at the University of Chicago who didn't participate in the research, notes that the samples studied here were well-preserved and came from a fairly pristine environment. She's less certain whether the same techniques could be applied to specimens collected in temperate and tropical areas that are richly biodiverse but where preservation tends to be worse. Still, Raghavan called the work \"fabulous in terms of all sorts of technological barriers being shattered.\" She says future work with RNA in these and other mammoth specimens may offer insights into what drove the species to extinction. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       María Ávila Arcos , an evolutionary genomicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who wasn't involved in the study, says the approach provides a new layer of insight into a species that vanished long ago. \"Having this information adds to our understanding how these creatures lived and how they adapted to their environment,\" she says. She's excited by the results — and not just for mammoths. She says they point the way to the potential study of ancient RNA viruses. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"A lot of very important pathogens like Ebola, COVID, influenza — they have RNA genomes,\" says Ávila Arcos. \"They mutate so rapidly. But if we want to understand their evolution or how these viruses have impacted populations in the past, we need to be able to recover the genetic material, which is RNA, from ancient samples.\" In other words, Yuka's RNA has opened a window for us to consider its past, while allowing scientists to dream about all the discoveries that lie ahead. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Scientists have extracted something remarkable from a woolly mammoth from the last ice age, and it offers a glimpse into what was happening inside this ancient animal's cells when it died. Here's science reporter Ari Daniel. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: It was 2012 when paleogeneticist Love Dalen first laid eyes on a special specimen in a lab in eastern Siberia. LOVE DALEN: Our Russian collaborators said, come here. And there's this, you know, dead mammoth lying there, and you can't believe your eyes, really, because it's so well preserved. It's a kind of, you know, holy hell moment when you see this. DANIEL: The animal had been found thawing out of a permafrost cliff near the Siberian coastline, says Dalen, who works at Stockholm University, not quite the entire body of a juvenile mammoth. DALEN: It does have deep scratch marks on its hindquarters. It either was attacked by cave lions while it was alive or maybe cave lions were kind of scavenging on it after it had died. DANIEL: It was then buried and frozen for some 39,000 years. The Russians named the animal, which they thought was female based on visual inspection, Yuka. Over the years, researchers had studied Yuka's DNA. DALEN: Which is kind of a recipe for how to make a mammoth. DANIEL: But Dalen and his colleagues wondered about its RNA, the flurry of molecules that basically translate that recipe into the building of an actual mammoth. DALEN: The RNA molecules instruct the cells how and when to make proteins. What makes cells different is the RNA activity in them, which genes are turned on and off. DANIEL: If Dalen could get RNA out of Yuka, he'd have a snapshot of the genes in use around the moment it died. The problem was that RNA doesn't usually hang around for very long - mere minutes, maybe hours, generally not millennia. DALEN: It felt like this is a very high-risk (laughter) project. DANIEL: Dalen and his team collected samples from 10 different mammoths, including Yuka, and painstakingly worked to extract RNA. DALEN: And then validating it, you know, to make sure that - is it really mammoth RNA? DANIEL: After churning through gigabytes of data, something unmistakable emerged, says Dalen - woolly mammoth RNA. Most of it was too fragmented, but three of the mammoths had sufficient material to analyze, including Yuka, whose muscle had been sampled. Some of the RNA related to muscle function, not that surprising, but the team also found RNA produced in response to stress. DALEN: That would be consistent with an animal being chased down by cave lions. But of course, there could also be other explanations. DANIEL: In addition, some of the animals' RNA - and DNA, it turned out - came from a Y chromosome. So genetically, Yuka was actually a male. All told, Dalen says the results are a stunning proof of principle, that it's possible to know which genes were once active in a now-extinct animal. DALEN: You're actually seeing processes going on inside the cells right around the time it died, and these processes have then been frozen in time for 40,000 years. DANIEL: The results are published in the journal Cell. MARIA AVILA ARCOS: Having this information adds to our understanding of how these creatures lived. DANIEL: Maria Avila Arcos is an evolutionary genomicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who wasn't involved in the study. She's excited by the results and not just for mammoths. She says they point the way to the potential study of ancient RNA viruses that have infected humans. AVILA ARCOS: A lot of very important pathogens like Ebola, COVID, influenza, they have RNA genomes. But if we want to understand their evolution or how these viruses have impacted populations in the past, well, we need to be able to recover RNA from ancient samples. DANIEL: In other words, Yuka's RNA has opened a window for us to consider its past while allowing scientists to dream about all the discoveries that lie ahead. For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.

The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\" She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize  a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists , pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. In  an interview with NPR in early October , Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes. \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\" Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\" Agriculture Department employee also on leave On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave. Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about food assistance programs in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.  \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them.

A right to speak on matters of public concern Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest. She points to a  1968 Supreme Court decision  that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights. \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\" Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out. \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up.

said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic. The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years. The new agreement replaces one the U.S. Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies.

Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars. Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could \"conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.\" But without that possibility, he said: \"The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.\" The opposition is much quieter this time around The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote. Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse. A handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing. A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough. \"The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\" Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video. Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago. Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There's no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven't had a say. Besides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing. The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026. Family members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities. Company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public. Some people hurt by Purdue's opioids would receive some money Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal. All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive. One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder. \"Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,\" asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York. Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. \"Some Sacklers are bad people,\" he said, \"but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.\" Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5566744","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:32:00-14:00","title":"First of 30 Bob Ross Works Aucted to Help Public TV, Breaking Records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The first of 30 original Bob Ross paintings, created during his popular PBS show 'The Joy of Painting,' were auctioned in November 2025 to support public television stations facing financial strain from federal funding cuts.

They broke records \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:32 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The first of 30 Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — have been auctioned off to support public television. Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show  The Joy of Painting . More than 400 half-hour episodes aired on PBS (and eventually the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) from 1983 to 1994, the year before Ross died of cancer at age 52. Ross' impact lives on: His show still airs on PBS and streams on platforms like Hulu  and Twitch . It has  surged in popularity  in recent years, particularly as viewers searched for comfort during COVID-19 lockdowns. Certified instructors continue teaching his wet-on-wet oil painting  technique to the masses , and the  Smithsonian acquired  several of his works for its permanent collection in 2019. But his artwork rarely goes up for sale — until recently.  In October, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) announced it would auction off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. It pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide. Auction house Bonhams is calling it the  \"largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market.\" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting and some activists have  even invoked him  in their calls for restoring federal funding to it. \"It's a medium that Bob just cherished,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc., in a phone call with NPR. \"With the cuts, it's just a natural inclination to support public television.\" The first three paintings sold in Los Angeles  on Nov. 11 . for a record-shattering $662,000. Bonhams says the works attracted hundreds of registrations, more than twice the usual number for that type of sale. Each sold for more than its estimated worth, led by  Winter's Peace,  which fetched $318,000 to set a new Ross auction record.  \"As anticipated, these paintings inspired spirited bidding, achieved impressive results and broke global auction records, continuing the momentum we've seen building in [Ross'] market,\" said Robin Starr, the general manager of Bonhams Skinner, the auction house's Massachusetts branch. \"These successes provide a solid foundation as we look ahead to 2026 and prepare to present the next group of Bob Ross works.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The next trio of paintings will be auctioned in Massachusetts in late January. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston. How the offering could benefit public broadcasters  At President Trump's direction, Congress voted in July to  claw back $1.1 billion  in previously allocated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), leaving the country's roughly 330 PBS and 244 NPR stations in a precarious position. CPB began  shutting down  at the end of September, PBS has  already cut 15%  of its jobs, and several local TV and  radio stations  have also announced layoffs and closures. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think he would be very disappointed\" about the CPB cuts, Kowalski said of Ross. \"I think he would have decided to do exactly what we're doing right now ... I think this would have probably been his idea.\" Kowalski, whose parents founded Bob Ross Inc. together with the painter in 1985, said Ross favored positive activism over destructive or empty rhetoric. \"That just was his nature,\" she said. \"He was like that in real life. So I think this would have been exactly the thing that he would have chosen. I suddenly got really emotional thinking about that.\" The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the  national TV channel Create , which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including  The Best of the Joy of Painting  (based on Ross' show),  America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and  Julia Child's  French Chef Classics . Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them. \"This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,\" the auction house says. Ross' paintings rarely hit the market The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all \"previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes\" of  The Joy of Painting,  according to Bonhams. Many have remained in secure storage ever since. They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and \"happy trees\" that became his trademark. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,  he later said , his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service. Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just \"happy accidents,\" talent is a \"pursued interest,\" and it's important to \"take a step back and look.\" \"Ross' gentle teaching style and positive philosophy made him a cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the art world,\" Bonhams says. While Ross was prolific, his paintings were intended for teaching instead of selling, and therefore rarely go on the market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, Bonhams sold two of Ross' early 1990s mountain and lake scenes as part of an online auction of American art. They fetched $114,800 and $95,750, surpassing expectations and setting a new auction world record for Ross at the time. Kowalski says that's when her gears started turning.  \"And it just got me to thinking, that's a substantial amount of money,\" she recalled. \"And what if, what if, what if?\"  Bonhams officially estimates that the 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million. But Starr, of the auction house, predicted in October that they will continue to exceed expectations, based on their artistic value, nostalgia factor and more.  \"Now we add in the fact that these are selling to benefit public television, I think the bidding is going to be very happy,\" she said. \"Happy trees, happy bidding.\"  Disclosure: This story was edited by general assignment editor Carol Ritchie and managing editor Vickie Walton-James. Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no NPR corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Public broadcasting helped make artist Bob Ross a household name. Now the late painter's company wants to give back. It is auctioning off dozens of his original works - many of them painted live on a show - to support public TV after federal funding cuts. NPR's Rachel Treisman reports. RACHEL TREISMAN, BYLINE: Bob Ross brought his soothing voice, sunny outlook and trademark afro to over 400 episodes of \"The Joy Of Painting,\" which aired on PBS between 1983 and his death in 1995. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") BOB ROSS: We don't make mistakes, you know. We have happy accidents. TREISMAN: Decades later, viewers are streaming it online and still watching it on public TV. It's a medium that Ross cherished, says Joan Kowalski, the president of Bob Ross, Inc. JOAN KOWALSKI: He used to talk about that a lot. He felt like he was in someone's living room and it was just that one person. TREISMAN: At the direction of President Trump, Congress voted in July to claw back over $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, slashing funding for PBS and NPR stations across the country. The next month, the auction house Bonhams sold two Bob Ross paintings for over $200,000 combined, exceeding their estimated value to set a new record. KOWALSKI: And it just got me to thinking, you know, that's a substantial amount of money, and what if? What if? What if? TREISMAN: Kowalski, along with Bonhams and American Public Television, came up with a plan. They will auction off 30 of Ross' original paintings, with all net proceeds going to APT and PBS stations nationwide. They hope the money raised will help stations pay the licensing fees to air popular programs like \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Rick Steves' Europe\" and \"The Best Of The Joy Of Painting.\" Kowalski says if Ross were alive today... KOWALSKI: I think this would've probably been his idea. TREISMAN: It's rare for Ross' paintings to make it out of storage and onto the market. He painted most of these 30 works on TV, while some are from his instructional books. They won't all be sold at once. The first three paintings are going up for auction in Los Angeles in November. Here's Robin Starr, the general manager of the auction house's Massachusetts branch. ROBIN STARR: Throughout the next year or so, we will be metering out the other 27 works, and those will be coming up out of our California, New York and Massachusetts galleries. TREISMAN: Many are Ross' trademark landscapes, with vibrant mountains, lake views, lush forests, and his signature happy little trees. Here he is working on \"Home In The Valley,\" a 1993 painting that will be up for auction in November. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") ROSS: It's very simple, and it will teach you how to use all the equipment. And it's a lot of fun. TREISMAN: The auction house estimates the paintings could bring in up to $1.4 million, but organizers are hoping they will once again exceed expectations. As Starr said, happy trees, happy bidding. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") ROSS: And with the old signature on here, I think we're going to call that one finished. TREISMAN: Rachel Treisman, NPR News.

Amid the rubble sits a boulder the size of a cargo truck that arrived with the avalanche that buried Armero on Nov. 13, 1985. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The deluge was caused by the eruption of snowcapped Nevado del Ruiz volcano 30 miles west of town. Warnings to evacuate arrived too late. The flood of lava, mud and debris killed 25,000 people. Angarita was climbing a tree to escape when he was caught by the massive mudslide. It carried him nearly 4 miles out of town before he could crawl to safety. He suffered 16 fractures to his face and jaw and compared the experience to being inside a blender. Angarita, who is now 71, says: \"I have no idea why I'm still alive.\" This week, Colombians are marking the 40th anniversary of the Armero tragedy with solemn ceremonies and renewed efforts to clarify what's become of town residents who went missing. \"Armero is a part of Colombian history. It was the worst natural disaster in Latin America with a huge number of victims,\" said Maurcio Cuéllar, a survivor of the tragedy and  mayor of the nearby town of Guayabal , where many Armero residents resettled. Although Nevado del Ruiz is a highly active volcano, there were few warnings ahead of the 1985 eruption. The lava melted part of the snowcap and created a massive mudslide that flowed down a river valley where Armero was located.  Many residents were glued to their TV sets for a big soccer match and had no idea something was wrong until the lights went out at about 9:30 p.m. and they heard a roar. \"The sound was like a whole bunch of helicopters in the sky,\" said Marco Rivera, who was 18 at the time and found refuge behind the sturdy gate of the town's cemetery. \"Lights were flashing in the dark because the mudslide swallowed up cars with their lights on and they were flipping over and over.\" Armero, once home to 29,000 residents, was never rebuilt. These days tour guides lead people through a wasteland of half-buried buildings and makeshift gravestones. Asthar Vreeswijk, a Dutch tourist, found Armero more moving than the petrified ruins of Pompeii. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If you're going to visit a place like this in Europe, it's totally structured and like renovated. You don't feel that it happened for real,\" she said. \"But here, everything it's like how it was. So, it's quite powerful.\" The biggest attraction is a shrine to Omayra Sánchez. Only 13, she was found by rescue workers in water up to her neck and trapped by the debris of her family's ruined house. As they tried to save her, she spoke to  TV journalists . \"Mommy, if you can hear me, pray so that I can walk again and that these people can help me,\" she said. After spending 70 hours in the water, Sánchez died of hypothermia. Many Colombians now view her as a kind of saint and at her gravesite they've placed hundreds of stone plaques thanking her for the blessings they believe she's bestowed upon them. If Nevado del Ruiz erupts again Colombia should be better prepared. Amid criticism of the belated and uncoordinated rescue efforts 40 years ago, the government created a  special agency to respond to disasters  while early warning systems have been installed in several towns near the volcano. Meanwhile, the search for possible missing people continues. Survivors reported a total of 583 missing children, says Francisco González, an Armero native who is leading an investigation into what happened to them. He acknowledges that many of these children likely perished in the landslide. Others were quickly adopted. However, chaos reigned after the landslide, record-keeping was shoddy, and the fate of these children may never be known. Even so, the Colombian government's child welfare agency, which handles adoptions, has pledged to open its records and archives to try to clarify what happened. Adriana Tierradentro, one of the agency's directors, told NPR: \"We will provide all the information that we can.\" In a symbolic search for truth, relatives of the missing launched hundreds of model boats into a river near Armero. Their tiny sails were emblazoned with photos of the missing. Among them is the younger brother of Mariela Díaz. Every year, she makes a pilgrimage back to her hometown of Armero to look for him. \"My brother  did  survive. Lots of people saw him. A doctor saw a photo of him and told me that he treated him,\" Díaz says. \"So, we still have hope that, maybe, he will reappear.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Forty years ago today, a volcanic eruption in Colombia caused an avalanche that killed 25,000 people in the town of Armero. It was one of the deadliest natural disasters ever in Latin America, and Armero was never rebuilt. As John Otis reports, many survivors are still in mourning. FERNANDO ANGARITA: (Speaking Spanish). JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Driving through the ruins of Armero, veterinarian Fernando Angarita shows me where the bakery, the hospital and the Presbyterian church once stood. ANGARITA: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Later, Angarita points to a boulder the size of a cargo truck. It arrived with the avalanche on the evening of November 13, 1985. The deluge was caused by the eruption of snow-capped Nevado del Ruiz volcano, 30 miles west of here. Warnings to evacuate arrived too late. The flood of lava, mud and debris buried this once bustling farm town. ANGARITA: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Angarita was caught by the massive mudslide that carried him nearly 4 miles out of town. He suffered 16 fractures to his face and jaw and compares it to being inside a blender. ANGARITA: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Angarita, who's now 71, says, I have no idea why I'm still alive. UNIDENTIFIED TOUR GUIDE: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: These days, tour guides lead people through a wasteland of half-buried buildings and makeshift gravestones. Asthar Vreeswijk, who's from the Netherlands, found Armero more moving than the petrified ruins of Pompeii. ASTHAR VREESWIJK: If you go to visit a place like this in Europe, totally structured and, like, renovated, you don't feel real - that it happened for real. But here it's like everything is how it was, so it's quite powerful. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OMAYRA SANCHEZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: The biggest attraction is a shrine to Omayra Sanchez.

Many Colombians consider Omayra Sanchez an unofficial saint. And here at her gravesite, they've placed hundreds of stone plaques, thanking her for the blessings they believe that she's bestowed upon them. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Four decades later, there are still many unanswered questions about the tragedy. For example, Nevado del Ruiz was a highly active volcano, and it's unclear why there were so few warnings ahead of the catastrophic eruption. FRANCISCO GONZALEZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Five hundred eighty-three children are reported by relatives as unaccounted for, says Francisco Gonzalez  an Armero native who is leading an investigation into what happened to them. Many likely perished in the landslide. Others were adopted. However, chaos reigned after the disaster. Record-keeping was shoddy, and the fate of these children may never be known. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: To mark the 40th anniversary of the tragedy, survivors launch hundreds of model boats into a nearby river in a symbolic search for truth. Their tiny sails are emblazoned with photos of the missing children. About half of the little boats immediately overturn in the rapids, but the rest of them seem to be staying upright. Surviving. MARIELA DIAZ: (Speaking Spanish). OTIS: Among the missing is the younger brother of Mariela Diaz. Every year, she makes a pilgrimage back to her hometown of Armero to look for him.

Trump himself has used the word against his own opponents. Others have used the word to denounce Skinny-Tok as \"body fascism.\" But why are Americans so willing to use the word? And is its ubiquity making it lose its meaning? In this episode, Brittany is joined by Nicholas Ensley Mitchell, a professor of education and policy at the University of Kansas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Episode Highlights Why \"fascism\" has become a go-to term LUSE: What are people trying to point out when they return to the term \"fascism\"? What are they really trying to say? MITCHELL: Danger. Fascism as a meme is closely synonymous with danger. [It communicates that] there is a threat and it's an active threat. Whenever you call someone a fascist, you call a group a fascist, you are not just saying that, \"Oh, they just exist.\" No. These guys are trying to take something away from you. They are trying to repress you. So it's a recognition that there is danger, and it's coming after me. It's an ingrained alarm in American culture. And I think despite all the changes in how it's been used in American history, it retains that sense of urgency. That this is not something to sleep on. The keys to fighting fascism could be in American history MITCHELL: When you think of Jim Crow as fascism, then that makes Black history and the resistance to Jim Crow an example of how you fight fascism. We have this image of the Civil Rights Movement: the bus boycotts, Rosa Parks is tired so she won't give up her seat, Martin Luther King gives a speech where he just talks about the content of character. What it actually was, in many regards, and how segregationists saw it, was a revolt. Black people have been calling — I mean, we've been talking about fascism [since] the thirties. Langston Hughes, he says in 1937, \"We Negroes in America do not have to be told what fascism is [in action]. We know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Is \"fascism\" the right term for our current moment?   LUSE:  [Responding to Mitchell saying \"cultural upheaval\" more aptly describes our current moment]  I mean, when you say \"cultural upheaval,\" that phrase is so neutral. I think that makes sense. But I will say, that when you say that to me, I understand why some people, regardless of where they are in the political spectrum, would reach for fascism because \"social upheaval\" doesn't satisfy the feeling of fear and discomfort that I think many people feel when these big moments of change are happening. MITCHELL: I would agree. And I think that's why you see this term get used so much. I think being afraid and being anxious, that is a normal reaction. That is not people overreacting. Because [cultural upheaval] is the environment into which European fascism emerged. But also, it's the environment that the civil rights movement really worked its power to force America to be a democracy. That is the outcome of the civil rights movement. I use the term cultural upheaval because these are tectonic shifts happening in the culture. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         BRITTANY LUSE, HOST:   Over the past few weeks, we've been breaking down the history, subtext and evolving meanings of the buzzwords you hear all over the news and social media. This is the ABCs of the culture wars. Our final word is F for fascism. NICHOLAS ENSLEY MITCHELL: We don't have a lot of terms in American society that are kind of cross-political, cross-cultural. Fascism is one them. LUSE: That's Professor Nicholas Ensley Mitchell. He teaches education theory, policy and practice at the University of Kansas. And he's right. You hear this word all over the political spectrum - from the press account of California Governor Gavin Newsom calling Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller a fascist in all caps on X, to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump calling former Vice President Kamala Harris a fascist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She's a Marxist, communist, fascist. LUSE: So how do we make sense of the word fascist being thrown around like this? Well, Professor Mitchell has been writing about the history of the word, and he's offering a perspective that I haven't really heard in mainstream conversations about fascism. MITCHELL: So I think we can talk about this really as just a meme, in the sense that we talk about other memes on the internet. Fascism - it's a succinct way of talking about an oppressive cultural regime or government or, you know, even vibe. LUSE: Yeah. I mean, to your point, it's not just being used in a political context. Like, I've seen people accuse some influencers of, quote-unquote, \"body fascism\" when they talk about weight loss and body image. You know, it shows up in a lot of different parts of American discourse. MITCHELL: And the reason for that is really tied up in American history. I mean, going really back into the - to the Second World War, you know, which is this conflict that just defines America. LUSE: What Professor Mitchell means is that modern American identity was crystallized in opposition to fascism. I mean, if you grew up in the American school system, I'm sure you can see the image right now of American soldiers heroically going to Europe to fight the Nazis in World War II. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT: Never before has there been a greater challenge to life, liberty and civilization. LUSE: They were fighting against fascism, against an ideology seen as counter to the American ideals of freedom and democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROOSEVELT: We believe that the Nazis and the fascists have asked for it, and they're going to get it. MITCHELL: Fascism is explicitly authoritarian. It is chauvinistic. It is sexist, and it is ultra nationalistic and racist. It's very obsessed with us and them. It's not just government. It's a full cultural movement. It is obsessed with aesthetics, how people dress, how people talk, symbols on buildings, the layout of cities, you know, ghettos versus where everybody else could go. LUSE: Other scholars define fascism as a dictatorship with enthusiastic public support and say that fascism can develop in a democracy when the people start to feel their leader doesn't have enough power to avert a perceived national crisis. And, you know, these definitions might stir a feeling in you right now. But there's an important difference between feeling that something is fascist and a formal system of fascism. MITCHELL: You know, in a democratic pluralistic society, you know, meaning is determined by individuals. You know, we determine meaning for ourselves. In a fascist society, meaning is determined by the state. They tell you what the history means. They tell you what everything means. LUSE: And in Professor Mitchell's essay, titled \"Want To Learn How To Respond To Fascism? Study Black History,\" he lays out why he thinks American history showcases this country's much older relationship with fascism, long before Nazism and World War II. MITCHELL: Fascists are always concerned with, like, let's have this mythic past so then we can control who we are and say who belongs and who doesn't belong and whose grievances and histories are real and who's are just complaining. In my experience, they all try to go for a very sanitized history, rather than what I call the messy truth. LUSE: Today, we're getting into why Professor Mitchell thinks this country needs to deal with what he calls its own fascist past. MITCHELL: And that's the messy truth of American history. It's a lot of contradictions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: Hello, hello. I'm Brittany Luse, and you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, a show about what's going on in culture and why it doesn't happen by accident. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: You know, we're going to get into the exact polling in a second, but a big headline from the past year is that a majority of Americans - particularly Democratic voters - have said that they see Trump as a fascist or dictator-like. I mean, if you did a quick search right now, you can find think piece on think piece arguing, you know, whether the country is sliding into fascism. I know a lot of people have concerns about our current moment, but is fascism the right descriptor for it? MITCHELL: Oh, that's a huge question. LUSE: (Laughter) Sorry. Sorry to lay that on you. MITCHELL: Oh, well, I mean, it is not surprising to me that people use that term because this term has been used various ways. I mean, of course, Nixon was called a fascist. Reagan was called a fascist. Obama was called a fascist... LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: ...For the Affordable Care Act. But also during the war - you know, in the war on terror, the term Islamic fascism was so common. LUSE: Right, right. MITCHELL: And that happens exactly when social media is starting to take off. That's early Facebook, later early Twitter - or X now. LUSE: Well, to kind of think in terms of today, a widely talked about poll from October 2024 taken right before the presidential election found that 49% of Americans identified Trump as a fascist. To your point about this being a political meme, 22% also described Vice President Harris as a fascist. Now, in April of this year, in another poll, 41% of Americans strongly defined Trump as a, quote, \"dangerous dictator,\" compared with 27% who strongly defined him as a, quote, \"strong leader who should be given power to restore America's greatness.\" What do these snapshots say about the state of this country? MITCHELL: For the past 25 years, we have been in this really intense cultural battle over who are we and who do we want to be? And we've had so much dynamic change in the past 25 years from, you know, Bush, 9/11 war on terror. And then you get the first Black president. And then, you know, Trump, from completely outside of the political world, he comes in, and then that brings his own - its own sort of upheaval. Me, personally, I think that when historians look back on this era, we're going to look at kind of like the twin - like, the twin poles of the change of whatever comes after this, it's going to be Obama and Trump. LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: Like... LUSE: And they also represent - they - even just in the popular imagination, they represent, in some ways, things that can feel very polar opposite to many people. MITCHELL: Yes. LUSE: And they are side by side. MITCHELL: And who gets to have power? And, you know... LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: ...Who, you know, that - you know, Obama, this, you know - and not just for him being, you know - him being African American. He's also not - he's an academic. He's very new to politics. And then you have Trump. Trump is a businessman, and he was a media figure, very kind of pop cultural figure. Of course, both of - you know, these aren't the first academic president and, you know, Trump's not the first... LUSE: Or the first, like, celebrity president, either, yeah. MITCHELL: So with all that change and all that clash, it does not surprise me that people were out there calling Obama a fascist, and it does not surprise me that people are calling Trump a fascist because that meme is our - it's our stand-in for there's a lot of change, and it's scaring some people. LUSE: So is kind of calling President Trump fascist, is this kind of - is this just like political name-calling or something adjacent to that, that may need some more teasing out? MITCHELL: I think it's the second one. We're grappling - I think Americans are grappling with how to make sense of a lot of this. So, like, there's one really key fact that I think is relevant to any discussion about Trump - and I don't know why more people don't talk about it. Every single one of Donald Trump's electoral coalitions was multiracial. It was multiclass. I was multi-ethnic. Multiracial fascism is not something that happens. LUSE: I mean, it - I know what you're saying is true. We have reported on these things... MITCHELL: Yes, you all have, yeah. LUSE: ...On this show before, but pulling just that fact out for a second and looking at it, it - I mean... MITCHELL: So... LUSE: It's like - it feels like you hit reset on my brain. MITCHELL: Trump didn't just have one multiracial coalition. He had three. LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: In the third election, he picks up a third of the non-white vote. You can't ignore that in any of these conversations, but a lot of people do. LUSE: Yeah. I guess maybe part of what you're saying then is that fascism doesn't quite fit as a descriptor because Trump has a diverse coalition backing him and that, you know, the idea of a multiracial coalition doesn't really fit with the definitions of fascism. And maybe there's a different word that might fit better. MITCHELL: So it's like, when you put it all together, what does this say about who we are - and into that uncertainty. LUSE: Yeah. MITCHELL: That's where you're going to see fascism get a lot of track in the popular culture as a meme for describing what they're seeing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: Coming up - the words Professor Mitchell thinks define this moment. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LUSE: Thinking about fascism again and in the broader sense, not just in the way that people are maybe using it to describe a swift political change that feels wrong to them, many Americans think of fascism as something very un-American. Not just, like, against American values, but more specifically, something that has happened before in history, but never here. But you argue that America has a strong history of fascism in Jim Crow and in American segregation. Tell me more about that. MITCHELL: Sure. We have this interesting and very impoverished view of Jim Crow. We'll talk about it as oh, it was separate water fountains and separate schools. No, it was that, but it was also ghettoizing people. It was brutalizing them. It was state-sanctioned murder and terrorism. You know, you get, like, you know, events like Red Summer where you have nationwide race riots. And then, of course, you get probably, you know, the most famous of those being the Tulsa Race Massacre in 1921. If I put those sorts of things in a European context, we would call those pogroms. LUSE: Yeah, yeah. For those who don't know, pogroms were violent attacks or riots targeting Jewish people by both Russians and Germans in the 19th and early 20th century. MITCHELL: You know, so you have these parallels between what's happening with Jewish people and minorities in, you know, Nazi Germany and in Europe and what's happening in the United States. It's the sort of thing that inspires the Nazis. The Nazis are looking at American eugenics for inspiration for their own murderous eugenics programs. LUSE: And just to lay out our timeline here - the Jim Crow period in the United States was from 1877 to around the 1950s. Nazism and its eugenics program really took off in the 1930s, when Jim Crow laws were still in effect. MITCHELL: You know, there's a great book, \"Hitler's American Model,\" that gets into how much the antisemitic laws were directly inspired by the Jim Crow laws, and they have the - one of the big justices, rather, of the Nazi regime saying in the book - and it's me paraphrasing - this set of laws is great for us. The only problem is that it considers Jewish people to be white. LUSE: I mean, I think, you know, some people might argue that Jim Crow isn't exactly quote-unquote, \"fascism,\" but in your view, why do you think it's important to frame Jim Crow like this? MITCHELL: When you think of Jim Crow as fascism, then that makes Black history and the resistance to Jim Crow an example of how do you fight fascism. We have this image of the Civil Rights Movement that, you know, you get the bus boycotts, Rosa Parks is tired so she won't give up her seat. LUSE: Right. MITCHELL: Martin Luther King gives a speech where he just talks about the content of character... LUSE: Right. MITCHELL: ...Versus what it actually was in many regards, and honestly, how segregationists saw it, that it was a revolt. Black people have been calling - I mean, we have been talking about fascism in the '30s. You know, Langston Hughes, he says in 1937, we Negroes in America do not have to be told what fascism is. We know. LUSE: So even the conversation we are having right now is not new. This is (inaudible). MITCHELL: Yeah, it's about a hundred years old. I want to say - I mean, Du Bois linked Jim Crow and fascism and, like, imperialism. But I think the big takeaway for me when I was talking about understanding Jim Crow as a form of fascism and why is that important, it's because in America, we have this view of American democracy as these ancient pillars driven into the ground. But if you're going to be bluntly honest, can you call yourself a democracy if a bunch of your people can't vote because of the color of their skin? LUSE: It's a fair question. MITCHELL: Or because of their sex? So to me - and I agree with the scholars who, you know, argue this - that America doesn't become a liberal democracy until 1965... LUSE: When the Voting Rights Act is passed. MITCHELL: ...When the Voting Rights Act is passed. So then in that sense, American liberal democracy is very fragile. It's new. Black people and non-white people and also white people across the political spectrum who were, they're down with this - they're down with the Civil Rights Movement - so conservative, liberal, all of that, they joined this revolt to overthrow this system. It's a multiracial creation. It's a multi-ethnic creation. It's a multipolitical creation. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and progressives all had hands in creating this thing. LUSE: For people who are seeing the continued stripping of the Voting Rights Act, for people who are thinking about the fact that most Americans support legalized access to abortion, and now, that's something that's not guaranteed by our Constitution anymore. MITCHELL: Yeah. LUSE: Many people feel like their rights are being stripped away. And I understand where you're coming from, where you say multiracial fascism is not a thing. I'm not necessarily saying that that's the proper term, but I'm trying to think about people who are going to be listening who might think, OK, well, if that's not fascism, then what is? What's a better descriptor? What's a better way to name this? MITCHELL: Cultural upheaval. I think we are in a period of intense cultural upheaval where the entire social contract is being relitigated. LUSE: I mean, I'll say, when you say cultural upheaval, that phrase is so neutral (laughter). And I think that, like, that makes sense, but I will say that when you say that to me, I understand why some people - regardless of where they are on the political spectrum - would reach for fascism, because social upheaval, it doesn't satisfy. It doesn't satisfy the feeling of fear and discomfort that I think many people feel when these big moments of change are happening. MITCHELL: I would agree. And I think that's why you see this term get used so much. I think being afraid and being anxious, those are - that is a normal reaction. That is not people overreacting because that is the environment into which, you know, European fascism emerged. But also, you know, it's the environment that the Civil Rights Movement really worked its power to force America to be a democracy. That is the actual outcome of the Civil Rights Movement. You know, I use the term cultural upheaval because these are tectonic shifts happening, you know, in the culture. And really, the question is, what's going to happen? How are people going to react? Because the government does not have the ability to just renegotiate the social contract. The entire culture is going to do that. LUSE: I have one last question. I mean, you know, even in the absence of total, you know, consensus regarding the characterization of our current political moment, because there are lots of people who feel like the country is moving in the right direction, what are people trying to point out or say when they return to the term fascism? What are they really trying to say? MITCHELL: Danger. Fascism as a meme, it is closely synonymous with danger. There is a threat, and it's an active threat. Because whenever you call someone a fascist or you call a group a fascist, you are not just saying that as a simple category of, oh, they just exist. No, like, these guys are trying to take something away from you. They are trying to repress you. So it's a recognition of there is danger, and it's coming after me. It's a ingrained alarm in American culture. And, you know, I think, despite all the changes and how it's been used in American history, it retains that sense of urgency that this is not something to sleep on. LUSE: Well, Nicholas, I really appreciate you sharing your knowledge with me today. I really, really got so much out of this conversation. Thank you so much. MITCHELL: Thank you for having me. LUSE: That was Professor Nicholas Ensley Mitchell. He teaches education theory, policy and practice at the University of Kansas.

What separates \"Sirat\" from those two films, though, is its lack of cynicism. Lopez is terrific as a father whose child has disappeared and who's understandably wary and mistrustful of the world. But even at his bleakest moments, Luis receives unexpected acts of compassion from his new companions. At one point, Esteban asks one of the ravers if he misses his family while traveling on the road. And the raver responds, I prefer this family. That might sound like something Vin Diesel would say in a \"Fast & Furious\" movie, and as it happens, Diesel's driving skills might've come in handy here. But Laxe's film is as sincere in its tenderness as it is unrelenting in its ferocity. There's something powerful about the movie's belief that even as an apocalypse looms, kindness can survive and meaningful relationships can form. Just because the world is pitiless, \"Sirat\" suggests, doesn't mean that people have to be. BIANCULLI: Justin Chang is a film critic at The New Yorker. He reviewed \"Sirat,\" now playing in select theaters. On Monday's show, actress and singer Cynthia Erivo. She returns on screen as Elphaba in \"Wicked: For Good,\" who claims her own power even as the world deems her the wicked witch. In Erivo's new memoir, \"Simply More,\" she explores similar themes, shedding other people's definitions of who she should be as a woman and an artist. I hope you can join us. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEFYING GRAVITY\") CYNTHIA ERIVO: (Singing) Something has changed within me. Something is not the same. I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game. Too late for second-guessing. Too late to go back to sleep. It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap. It's time to try defying gravity. I think I'll try defying gravity, and you can't pull me down. BIANCULLI: To keep up with what's on the show and get highlights of our interviews, follow us on Instagram at @nprfresh Air.

Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 10:40 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It feels fitting, in a way, that so many notable books this week are premised on endings — of lives, relationships, eras, even. After all, Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day — also known as Veterans Day in the U.S. – is Tuesday. The day annually  marks the end  of one of history's most catastrophic conflicts, World War I. For the most part, the endings that animate many of this week's new novels don't seek such world-historical consequence. Ann Packer, Quiara Alegria Hudes and the other authors who grace the list below are concerned with much more intimate details, the kind you're more likely to encounter just down the street than on a battlefield or at an international summit. That said, the twisty history of currency — the subject of this week's one nonfiction entry in the roundup — reinforces a lesson learned with the peace of 1918: Beware of endings; they have the odd habit of being yet another beginning in disguise. Some Bright Nowhere , by Ann Packer Ann Packer's first novel in a decade finds the American author again pursuing a deceptively simple premise: A long-married couple must prepare for and confront their final weeks together before death comes for one of them. But don't be fooled by the saccharine-sounding summary. As  Fresh Air 's Maureen Corrigan explained in  a review of Packer's previous novel ,  The Children's Crusade , the author has a knack for turning what might have been \"mundane mass-market fiction\" into a rich, splintered narrative that \"illuminate[s] the unexpected depths of the commonplace.\" The White Hot , by Quiara Alegria Hudes It's possible you've already encountered Hudes' writing without knowing it. Though her name is new to the adult fiction shelf, the veteran playwright penned the book for the Tony-winning musical  In the Heights ,  wrote the screenplay  for  its 2021 film adaptation  and won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for  her play  Water by the Spoonful , about the return of an Iraq war veteran. In  The White Hot ,  she explores a departure , in the voice of a young mother who tries to understand and explain her decision to leave her family for the freedom of a one-way ticket far, far away. The Silver Book , by Olivia Laing Laing's writing roams a Venn diagram of memoir, art criticism, history and fiction, rarely pursuing just one genre without including at least some elements of the others. Her memoir  The Lonely City , for instance, wove the stuff of academic journals into a  chronicle of her life in New York City . Her only previous novel,  Crudo , dressed up in the persona of author Kathy Acker for an exercise that NPR's reviewer admiringly called a \"memoir in drag.\" For its part,  The Silver Book , though a novel, sets its inventions in an especially consequential – and controversial – era of Italian cinema: the final year or two before the brutal, unsolved murder of director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Evensong , by Stewart O'Nan O'Nan's latest novel finds the \"oracle of the ordinary and maven of the middle class\" — as NPR reviewer Heller McAlpin  described the novelist in 2012  — once again mining the mundane for its hidden magic. In  Evensong , the cult favorite centers a small, lovingly rendered group of older women as they navigate the peculiar challenges of growing older, together as friends. The History of Money: A Story of Humanity , by David McWilliams McWilliams is an Irish economist,  podcaster  and founder of a festival that  pairs world economics with standup comedy . Promoting the festival back in 2010, McWilliams  explained to NPR  why he orients his work more toward the hoi polloi than the ivory tower: \"If you think that knowledge is power, well, then giving people the knowledge, packaging the knowledge in such a way that the knowledge becomes accessible — that empowers the people.\" That rings true in this lively, lightfooted life story of currency, which cares less for comprehensiveness than keeping the door open for experts and novices alike. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5606359","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"12:02:00-05:00","title":"Ken Burns' 'American Revolution' will make you think differently about U.S. history","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ken Burns' new six-part documentary, 'The American Revolution,' offers a deeply immersive and nuanced exploration of the Revolutionary War, utilizing innovative visual techniques such as drone footage and close-ups of re-enactors' bodies to create authenticity without period photographs.

His latest effort is a six-part series called  The American Revolution. By focusing on the Revolutionary War ,  Burns is revisiting some very familiar territory. His long and impressive filmography includes a history of Congress, and biographies of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. He's done deep dives into American military conflicts, including  World War II  and the  Vietnam War . Throughout his career, Burns has developed and perfected the tricks of his particular trade: the evocative use of music and quotations from speeches and correspondence; the use of actors to read the words of historical participants; the zooming in and out to reveal key details in period photos; and the painstaking attention to sound effects, from birds to bullets, to help bring those images to life. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       All of that knowledge, and all of those gimmicks, are utilized in  The American Revolution , an exceptional work about the founding of our country. It's written by Geoffrey C. Ward, who wrote  The Civil War  and many other Burns documentaries, including the ones on Congress and Thomas Jefferson. And it's co-directed by Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, both of whom have worked with Burns for years. But  The American Revolution  presents a challenge that even  The Civil War  did not. No photographs, period. To compensate, Burns and company use war re-enactors and place them in the actual historical locations.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On many — let's say most — documentaries using a similar technique, the effect can be cheesy. But in  The American Revolution,  the directors avoid showing the faces of the actors re-enacting battle movements. Instead, parts of their bodies are shown in intense close-up: a bandaged hand here, a muddy boot there. Elsewhere, in an approach that borders on pure art, the directors use drones to capture the action from high, high above. It's unusual — and beautiful. Battles are the surprisingly dominant ingredient of this series.  The American Revolution  goes into more detail about individual battles than I ever learned in my own American history classes — but new and vintage maps, animated to show troop positions and movements, make it all very clear, and very vibrant. The actors quoting from the historical participants, and the historians interviewed to comment on the action, do the rest. Peter Coyote, the actor who has narrated many Burns documentaries, does so again here. He's got a great voice for it, and leans into all the difficult place names, and people's names, with confident authority.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In their various war documentaries, Burns and his team always have focused as much on the ground troops as on the generals — often much more so, telling their story from the bottom up, rather than the top down.  The American Revolution  does both: We hear important observations from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, but also from Native Americans, revolutionary women, enslaved people and others not always given voice in such narratives.  In addition, the program's historians make us think differently about the history we're witnessing. In the colonies, those who were faithful to the crown were called Loyalists, and those against them called themselves Patriots. This series humanizes both sides, and also explains why some Native tribes, including the Shawnees, sided with the British in hopes of protecting their own lands.  The sheer number of the battles, and the details about them, attest to how hard our ancestors fought for the notion of a Federalist society. At the end,  The American Revolution  reminds us that the quest to maintain that society, and to strive to achieve a more perfect union, is far from over.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604279","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:38:00-11:38","title":"The Running Man, 'Now You See Me,' and George Clooney are in theaters","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights several film releases in 2025, including a new installment of the 'Now You See Me' heist franchise with expanded casting and declining visual credibility, a film adaptation of Stephen King’s dystopian novel 'The Running Man' that offers action-packed entertainment but softens its social critique, and a mid-life crisis dramedy starring George Clooney titled 'Jay Kelly.'

     'The Running Man,' a new 'Now You See Me,' and George Clooney are in theaters \n         By Bob Mondello, Linda Holmes \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:38 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         There's yet another  Now You See Me  in theaters this weekend, along with yet another Stephen King adaptation. George Clooney plays a charming Hollywood star in Jay Kelly, while a warm, funny and goosebump-raising documentary streams on Apple TV. Here's what to watch. Now You See Me, Now You Don't In theaters Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The cast keeps expanding in this magic-centric rob-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor heist franchise, as if the writers saw  Ocean's Eleven  through  Thirteen  and thought, \"we could do that.\" New kids Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt join original Horsemen (and hangers-on) Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Isla Fisher in pursuit of a priceless diamond held by a money-laundering arms dealer (Rosamund Pike). That fits the aesthetic of the first two  Now You See Me' s (shouldn't this one really be called  Now You Three Me ?) — but where the earlier films seemed to want you to believe the on-screen magicians were pulling off their tricks, this one mostly settles for CGI and cinematic trickery, so that even card tricks fall slightly flat. Eisenberg's prickly snark is still fun, but with the tricks getting less convincing and the scripts more exhausting, it might be time for this franchise to go up in a puff of smoke.  — Bob Mondello  The Running Man  In theaters Friday  This trailer includes instances of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       One tricky thing about writing dystopian fiction with staying power is that the future eventually catches up with you. Stephen King's 1982 novel  The Running Man  takes place in 2025. In his vision of, well, now, there is widespread poverty, rule by giant corporations, and exploitative entertainment that takes advantage of people who are suffering and tries to force ordinary people to despise each other. There is environmental destruction, mass surveillance, and even the resurgence of polio. Just imagine. The story follows a man named Ben Richards, who tries to provide for his family and his sick kid by going on a game show also called  The Running Man . On the show, he has to survive on the streets for 30 days while professional assassins pursue him. If he makes it, he wins a billion dollars. But, of course, nobody has ever survived. In the new adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright, Richards (played by Glen Powell) auditions for the game shows run by the megacorporation known as The Network because his daughter has the flu, and Richards and his wife can't afford a doctor for her without a big prize. The biggest problem with this adaptation is that if you read the book, you probably know there are a couple of things about the ending that a major studio movie released in 2025 is unlikely to replicate. As an action movie that hits the gas, gets the running man running, and doesn't let up, it works quite well, and it's a lot of fun. But some of King's sharper-elbowed commentary about what it might take to escape this kind of oppressive society is blunted a bit, making it a less effective critique of its world than the book was.  — Linda Holmes  Jay Kelly In limited theaters Friday; on Netflix Dec. 5 \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Hollywood star Jay Kelly — handsome, affable, debonaire, sixty-something … in short, George Clooney — reconsiders his life choices on a trip to Tuscany in Noah Baumbach's bland mid-life crisis dramedy. Estranged from one daughter (Riley Keough), and distressed by the growing distance of another (Grace Edwards) who's off on a trip to Europe before college, he's feeling alone in a crowd of paid companions, including his faithful manager (Adam Sandler, excellent) and publicist (Laura Dern, whose talents are mostly wasted). After a public altercation with a college buddy, he opts to avoid the PR blowup and possibly find some catch-up time with his daughter by taking an impromptu trip to Italy for a career tribute he'd previously turned down.  Minor misadventures ensue — a train trip punctuated by a purse snatching incident, a reunion with his coarse dad (Stacy Keach), a fight with his increasingly put-upon manager. Not sure I was feeling anyone's pain about the loneliness of stardom, the heartbreak of success, the … whatever the hell else this was about. Baumbach has wandered into the territory of  8½  and  Stardust Memories  and he gets a bit lost in the woods, but Clooney's magnetism goes a decent way to making things palatable, the cinematography is pretty and Sandler dominates whenever he's on screen.  — Bob Mondello  The Things You Kill In limited theaters Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Iranian-Canadian director Alireza Khatami's Turkish-language thriller follows Ali, a university professor, as his life unravels. His mother's sick, his father's a bully, his wife wants a child (he hasn't told her his sperm count is low), and his only safe place is an arid farm (\"garden\") to which he retreats whenever possible. The arrival of Reza, a stranger who is game to do the things Ali won't (bribe bureaucrats to deepen his well, maybe even kill his father) complicates things, and also, in a sense, solves them. The filmmaker's first name provides a not-insignificant clue as to what's going on, as his filmmaking deconstructs the story and his protagonist in initially confusing, and then riveting ways.  — Bob Mondello Come See Me In the Good Light Streaming on Apple TV starting Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       There's no way to make this documentary sound like the upbeat, rousing and often downright hilarious romp it is, but here goes: At the urging of comedian Tig Notaro, poet and spoken-word star Andrea Gibson and life partner and fellow poet Megan Falley invited filmmaker Ryan White and his crew into their home in 2021. It was mid-pandemic, and the crew was allowed full access to the couple's every thought and action as they dealt with turtledove love, mailbox madness, and – here's the part where you say, \"no, this does not sound like a good time\" — Gibson's Stage 4 ovarian cancer journey. At the Middleburg Film Festival screening I attended in October — three months after Gibson's death — the director spoke beforehand, giving the audience \"permission to laugh,\" which it definitely did. It also sniffled a bit, but less than you might expect, because Gibson's vibrant, assertively affirmative outlook doesn't really brook tears, and the filmmaker's warmth and humor, even in times of despair, gives the story a radiance that makes mundane moments feel precious, while allowing hopeful moments to raise goosebumps.  — Bob Mondello  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604667","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Dear Life Kit: I'm tall.

Dear Life Kit, I'm a six-foot-tall woman, and both complete strangers and new acquaintances often make comments like, 'Wow, you're tall.' Some people say I should take it as a compliment, but it makes me feel like a spectacle. I don't want to normalize the comments, but I also don't want to embarrass the commenters. How can I respond? —  More than my height   Brittany Luse:  I appreciate the fact that you don't want to embarrass people. I want to offer the idea of maybe not 100% embarrassment or even 60% embarrassment, but a nice, gritty little 15% embarrassment. You can respond with, 'Oh my gosh, you're the first person to tell me that.' Give them a little giggle. Give them the opportunity to laugh with you, but they know you're not playing. And if they don't take the hint the first time, you can be direct. 'Is this catching your attention so much that you have to say something right now?' I think you can give someone one pass with a little joke to let them know you don't like it. And then after that, be really direct. Adia Gooden:  I agree.  If people continue to cross this boundary, be more serious about it. You can say, 'It's not cool. I'm not comfortable with it. Please stop.' If somebody feels a little embarrassed and realizes they shouldn't have said that, that's OK. You're not saying they're an awful person, but you're communicating that what they did is problematic. They should feel a little taste of it so that they stop. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dear Life Kit, I've been with my boyfriend for seven years. I'm starting to feel pressure from family members and friends to settle down and have a wedding. We're planning to get married, but we want to wait until we are more financially secure. How can I let people know we're not in a hurry to get married without being rude? —  Not in a hurry Gooden:  If people are coming from a loving place, just say, 'We're being really intentional about how we want to start the next chapter of our lives together. Weddings are expensive. We don't want to start our lives together in debt or going into debt.' Luse:   When I was in a similar situation, I would say, 'If you've got tens of thousands of dollars that you want to give me, go right ahead.' Or the other, mildly gentler, response, 'I don't have any updates to share right now, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.' Which is what I say now when people ask me about having children. Gooden:  [If a lighter touch doesn't work,] you can just say, 'Please stop asking us. It's kind of frustrating when you keep asking us about our plans. We will be sure to let you know when we are going in that direction, but until then, please respect our decision-making.' \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dear Life Kit, My future sister-in-law often says things that are hurtful or judgmental. She once told me, 'I love you, but you're too self-absorbed to own a dog.' And this was over a meal that I brought over for her. I've had pets, raised my younger sister and taken care of my sick mom. I don't think most people would consider me self-absorbed. Her comments bring my fiancé and me down. I've begun avoiding her. How can I cope in a healthy way and still have a relationship with her? —  Feeling frozen? Gooden:  This might be a situation where you need to recognize when someone's comments are not about you. If you know that you're not self-absorbed, then you shouldn't let somebody's comment derail you or override what you know to be true about yourself. So, how do you stay grounded in who you are? You need to discern whose opinion you're going to take and whose opinion you're going to leave. If your wise grandma says, 'Hey, it seems like you've been focusing on yourself a little too much, and I want you to think about this.' That might be different than a comment from a sister-in-law who tends to make judgmental comments. She may be somebody whose opinion you're going to ignore. You may also need to set some boundaries. For example, 'Hey, I feel judged when you give me advice. So I prefer that not to be part of our relationship.' Luse:  At the end of the day, this is your fiancé's sister, and I wonder if he could play a bigger role in managing your relationship with her as a couple. It sounds like maybe he's also feeling the impact of her judgment. I'll share something my therapist said to me once when I was navigating a difficult relationship: 'Have you ever considered that this person may never change? I want you to consider that, and then think about how you want to conduct yourself going forward.' You can't control her. You can only control how and when you interact with her, to a certain degree.

brought the release of the  Nintendo Switch 2  and blockbuster exclusives like Mario Kart World. But the year has also seen a parade of indie breakouts, from Blue Prince to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Meanwhile, the video game industry lurched from  massive strikes  to  landmark labor deals  to  deep layoffs . NPR staff and contributors have explored the breadth of the gaming year, from long-awaited sequels like Death Stranding 2 and Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves to imaginative tabletop games like Molly House and Daggerheart. Whether you're looking for a short diversion or an epic 50-hour adventure, we invite you to discover your next favorite game on this interactive list. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Let's talk video games now. We are only in July, and already there have been some great game releases this year. So we've asked some of our NPR colleagues to share their favorites. First game up, an indie puzzle game called Blue Prince. GRAHAM REBHUN, BYLINE: My name is Graham Rebhun, and I am a software engineer on the publishing team at NPR. It's one of those crazy puzzle games that always seems to have another thread that you haven't pulled on yet. You're basically exploring this huge mansion that your rich uncle left to you, and each room you open has unique activities, resources to grab and hints and clues about how everything in the house works and how you fit into the story that's being told through all of the letters and notes and things around the house. By the time I finished the first part of the game - and yes, there are many layers to Blue Prince - I had several notebook pages filled with notes and diagrams, which, for me, is the sign of a good puzzle game. KELLY: Next, we're going to hear about a highly anticipated sequel from gaming legend Hideo Kojima. ANGEL CARRERAS, BYLINE: Death Stranding 2 is a very stupid game, and I mean that in the most endearing way possible. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH\") UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR: (As character) This is the cargo you need to deliver. Be sure to get it to its destination in one piece. It's an excellent idea to place the most important cargo in your backpack. CARRERAS: My name is Angel Carreras. I'm a assistant producer at NPR. This whole game, people call it a walking simulator - derogatory. This is actually a positive thing. I think it's - what game is going to have you think about terrain and the lives of people and the things you're bringing them? Never before have I been like, oh, my God, I got to get this medicine to these people, or I got to deliver this pizza to this poor guy. And on top of that, you're fighting these, like, beings that are crossing from death into our world. And it's just - I don't know, man. You just have to play it yourself. That's really all I can say. KELLY: OK. So if you are maybe looking for a game with a more epic storyline, you can try Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. KAITY KLINE, BYLINE: I'm Kaity Kline. I'm an associate producer with Morning Edition and Up First. It's like, when people say, like, video games are art, I think that they specifically mean games like this. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"CLAIR OBSCUR: EXPEDITION 33\") BILLIE FULFORD-BROWN: (As Sophie) You're fighting to change things. KLINE: There's not one thing about the game that I can pinpoint as my absolute favorite because I think it's just, like, perfection across the board. I think the characters are so well developed. I think the writing is so good. The art, the fighting, the - just, like, everything - the story, the plot. And, like, I almost never restart a game as soon as I finish it. But for this one, I wiped my tears and just immediately started over because I think there's so many things that you didn't notice your first playthrough that suddenly have so much meaning the second go around, and I wanted to just see every little thing that I missed. Yeah. It's like, just wherever you think the story is going to go, you're wrong. KELLY: We have got tons more video game recommendations from our staff and some tabletop games, too.

2025-11-14T05:05:42+00:00\n\nBy the time Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the financier. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein’s relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. During that time, Epstein’s network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein’s crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein’s influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender. Epstein kept a diverse political network Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors. In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon first forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.” “luv it,” Epstein responded. Epstein wrote that he’d just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you’ll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn’t work.” “its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.” In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment. Epstein’s wealthy social circles The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs. That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.” Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn’t complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It’s unclear if Thiel ever responded. In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.” “Trump doesn’t like him,” responded Sulayem. A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.” “Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back. In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.” But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman. “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote. Epstein kept in touch with academics The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him. “Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein. In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he’d had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. “No. We didn’t have sex. Decided it wasn’t a good idea,” replied Krauss. Krauss said in an email to The Associated Press that he never hid the fact that he knew Epstein, and interacted with him several times. “I sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew when false allegations about me were circulated in the press in 2018,” said Krauss. “I was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested” in 2019. In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York. In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky’s use. “you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump. Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I’m busy’. I said awfully coy u are.” Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said. Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organizations’ websites. ___ Associated Press reporters John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, and Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to fix spelling of former French president Sarkozy’s first name, It also corrects that Epstein was not a billionaire."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/commercial-drivers-licenses-california-duffy-immigrants-newsom-76077ff8e4cfd706ead9bef99eb7fc79","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:52:09+00:00","title":"Federal Court Halts New Rules Restricting Immigrant Commercial Driver’s Licenses","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia has temporarily halted the Transportation Department’s proposed restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses for immigrants, ruling that the rules failed to follow proper procedural standards and did not provide a convincing safety rationale.

2025-11-14T15:52:09+00:00\n\nThe Transportation Department’s new restrictions that would severely limit which immigrants can get commercial driver’s licenses to drive a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court. The court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can’t be enforced right now. The court said the federal government didn’t follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to “articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety.” The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver’s licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said. Duffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state’s records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules — not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on “This is not a ruling on the merits of the case. Secretary Duffy will continue working to keep unqualified, foreign drivers off American roads,” a Transportation Department spokesman said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office didn’t respond immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom’s office has said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when issuing these licenses to noncitizens. Duffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns. The driver in the Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, appeared before a judge in St. Lucie County, Florida, on Thursday, where his attorneys asked to continue his court proceedings into January as they prepare for trial. Singh has pleaded not guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. The new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Trucking trade groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have supported the new rule. There is a bill in Congress that would enshrine the new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses in law. “For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,” said Todd Spencer, the trucking association’s president. Duffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy has revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he said earlier this week that he may take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. ___ Associated Press writer Kate Payne contributed to this report from Tallahassee, Florida."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardon-biden-justice-department-ed-martin-d525b1911534a40f70394fddf396acc1","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"01:51:10+00:00","title":"Trump Pardons Raise Signature Controversy After Identical Signatures Online","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department faced public scrutiny when it initially posted pardons signed by President Donald Trump with nearly identical signatures, sparking concern over authenticity.

favoritism"],"content":"Published: 2025-11-15T01:51:10+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department posted pardons online bearing identical copies of President Donald Trump’s signature before quietly correcting them this week after what the agency called a “technical error.” The replacements came after online commenters seized on striking similarities in the president’s signature across a series of pardons dated Nov. 7, including those granted to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry , former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon. In fact, the signatures on several pardons initially uploaded to the Justice Department’s website were identical, two forensic document experts confirmed to The Associated Press. Within hours of the online speculation, the administration replaced copies of the pardons with new ones that did not feature identical signatures. It insisted Trump, who mercilessly mocked his predecessor’s use of an autopen, had originally signed all the Nov. 7 pardons himself and blamed “technical” and staffing issues for the error, which has no bearing on the validity of the clemency actions. The questions about Trump’s signature come amid a new flurry of clemency and weeks after the president claimed to not even know Changpeng Zhao, a crypto billionaire he pardoned last month. He said in an interview with 60 Minutes that the case had been “a Biden witch hunt.” Related Stories Trump cuts ties with ‘Wacky’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, once among his top MAGA-world defenders 3 MIN READ Judge bars Trump from immediately cutting funding to the University of California 3 MIN READ US prosecutor in Wyoming promises crackdown on pot in national parks and on other public lands 4 MIN READ “A basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,” said Tom Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert who is president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners. “It’s very straightforward,” said Vastrick, who compared the apparently identical images, now only visible through the online Internet Archive, with the replacements at AP’s request. Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the “website was updated after a technical error where one of the signatures President Trump personally signed was mistakenly uploaded multiple times due to staffing issues caused by the Democrat shutdown.” “There is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and DOJ posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,” Gilmartin said in a statement to AP, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email that Trump “signed each one of these pardons by hand as he does with all pardons.” “The media should spend their time investigating Joe Biden’s countless auto penned pardons, not covering a non-story,” she wrote. Trump has been an outspoken critic of Biden’s use of the autopen to conduct executive business, going as far as to display a picture of one such device in place of a portrait of his predecessor in a new “Presidential Walk of Fame” he created along the West Wing colonnade. His Republican allies in Congress last month released a blistering critique of Biden’s alleged “diminished faculties” and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat’s use of the autopen among “the greatest scandals in U.S. history.” The Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden’s actions in office and sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a full investigation. “Senior White House officials did not know who operated the autopen and its use was not sufficiently controlled or documented to prevent abuse,” the House Oversight Committee found. “The Committee deems void all executive actions signed by the autopen without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president’s own consent.” On Friday, Republicans who control the committee released a statement that characterized Trump’s potential use of an electronic signature as legitimate, which it distinguished from Biden’s. But Rep. Dave Min, a California Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, seized on the apparent similarities in the initial version of the pardons and called for an investigation of the matter, deploying the Republican arguments against Biden in a statement to AP that “we need to better understand who is actually in charge of the White House, because Trump seems to be slipping.” Regardless, legal experts say the use of an autopen has no bearing on the validity of the pardons. “The key to pardon validity is whether the president intended to grant the pardon,” said Frank Bowman, a legal historian and professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law who is writing a book on pardons. “Any re-signing is an obvious, and rather silly, effort to avoid comparison to Biden.” Much of Trump’s mercy has gone to political allies , campaign donors and fraudsters who claimed they were victims of a “weaponized” Justice Department. Trump has largely cast aside a process that historically has been overseen by nonpolitical personnel at the Justice Department. Casada, a disgraced former Republican speaker of the Tennessee House, was sentenced in September to three years in prison. He was convicted of working with a former legislative aide to win taxpayer-funded mail business from state lawmakers who previously drove Casada from office amid a sexting scandal. Strawberry was convicted in the 1990s of tax evasion and drug charges. Trump cited the 1983 National League Rookie of the Year’s post-career embrace of his Christian faith and longtime sobriety when pardoning him. McMahon, a former New York City police sergeant, was sentenced this spring to 18 months in prison for his role in what a federal judge called “a campaign of transnational repression.” He was convicted of acting as a foreign agent for China after he tried to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland. McMahon’s defense attorney, Lawrence Lustberg, said he was not aware the pardon documents had been replaced until he was contacted Friday by an AP reporter. “It is and has always been our understanding that President Trump granted Mr. McMahon his pardon,” Lustberg wrote in an email. ___ Mustian reported from Natchitoches, Louisiana.

Indiana state Senate announced Friday that his chamber will no longer meet in December as planned to vote on redistricting , citing a lack of support from his members even after months of pressure from the White House. The announcement greatly diminishes the likelihood of redistricting the Midwest state. Indiana is the second Republican state to recently resist the push from President Donald Trump to create new congressional maps that would favor Republican candidates in the 2026 elections. “Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said in a statement. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.” Indiana Republicans, who hold a supermajority in both legislative chambers, have been under pressure to redraw the state’s congressional districts since August. Vice President JD Vance has made two trips to Indianapolis to speak with lawmakers and legislative leaders have met with Trump in the Oval Office.

Those in favor of redistricting Indiana often point to Democratic states with none or few congressional Republicans as a reason to make Indiana’s map entirely red. While Trump won Indiana by 19 percentage points in the 2024 election, many Indiana Republicans have balked at the idea of gerrymandering . Some said it could backfire politically, while others generally considered it to be unethical. State Sen. Kyle Walker, a Republican, announced in a statement Thursday that he would not support redistricting, saying the overwhelming majority of his constituents are against it. After Vance’s second visit to Indianapolis, Bray said his caucus did not have the votes for the measure to succeed. An uncertain future for redistricting efforts Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican and ally to Trump, called for a special session on redistricting last month to force a vote. State lawmakers in both chambers decided to take up the issue by starting the 2026 regular session early in December in an extremely rare scheduling maneuver, saying it would offset the cost of a special session. “Our state senators need to do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps,” Braun said in a statement Friday. “Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues.” The Senate’s rejection means that lawmakers might not be able to redistrict at all before the 2026 midterm elections. Lawmakers in both chambers will convene for their regular session in January, but the deadline to file to run for Congress in Indiana is in early February. Republican state Sen. Liz Brown, who is in favor of redistricting, said in a statement that Republicans should “consider all options for getting redistricting back on the table.” With just 10 Democrats in the 50-member Senate, that means more than 15 Republicans oppose the idea. Republicans in the Indiana House have enough votes in support of new congressional maps, but it is unclear if the chamber will still meet in December to vote on redistricting as previously planned. Democratic Indiana lawmakers framed Bray’s announcement as the end of redistricting. “I want to thank Senator Bray and all the Republican and Democratic members of the Indiana Statehouse who held firm on Hoosier values,” said U.S. Rep. Andre Carson, a Democrat representing Indianapolis, in a social media post. Carson’s district would likely be a target of redistricting. Redistricting in other states Trump wants Republican-led states to redraw congressional districts to boost the party’s chances of winning more seats in next year’s congressional elections. The stakes are high, because Democrats need to gain just three seats to win control of the House and impede Trump’s agenda. Trump’s trying to buck historical trends, in which the president’s party typically loses seats in the midterms. Republican-led legislatures or commissions in Texas , Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio all have adopted news districts designed to boost Republicans’ chances in next year’s elections. Voters in California have countered by adopting new districts drawn to improve Democrats’ chances of winning more seats. And the Democratic-led Virginia General Assembly also has taken a step toward redistricting with a proposed constitutional amendment. But Indiana is the second state with a Republican-led legislature to drop plans for a redistricting session, despite pressure from Trump to do it. While struggling to round up enough support, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins announced earlier this month that Republican lawmakers were ending a petition drive to call themselves into special session for congressional redistricting. Recent redistricting efforts also have stalled in some Democratic states despite pressure from national party leaders. Illinois lawmakers declined to take up congressional redistricting during an October session, because of concerns that redrawing the already heavily Democratic districts to try to gain yet another seat could weaken representation for Black voters. That came despite a personal visit from U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and support for redistricting from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In Maryland, where Democrats already hold seven of the eight U.S. House seats, Democratic Senate President Bill Ferguson said last month that his chamber won’t move forward with redistricting. He expressed concerns that an attempt to draw eight Democratic districts could backfire with losses in other districts and lead even more Republican-led states to retaliate with their own redistricting. But Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, kept the effort alive this month by forming a commission to consider mid-decade redistricting. ___ Volmert reported from Lansing, Michigan.

The announcement greatly diminishes the likelihood of redistricting in the Midwest state. Indiana is the second Republican-led state that has recently resisted the president’s push for new congressional maps favoring GOP candidates in 2026 elections. “Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said in a statement. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.” ▶ Read more about Indiana and redistricting New USDA data casts doubts on China’s soybean purchase promises touted by Trump after Xi meeting Released Friday, after the government reopened , the Agriculture Department report shows only two Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans since the summit between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, totaling 332,000 metric tons. That’s well short of the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to purchase by January and nowhere near the 25 million metric tons she said it would buy in each of the next three years. American farmers were hopeful that their biggest customer would resume buying their crops. But Tanner Ehmke, CoBank’s lead economist for grains and oilseed, said there is not much incentive for China right now because it has plenty of soybeans on hand from Brazil and other South American countries and the remaining tariffs ensure that U.S. soybeans remain more expensive. “We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” Ehmke said. How chummy is too chummy? Epstein emails shine light on relationships between journalists, sources The emails to and from Jeffrey Epstein released this week shine a light on the delicate relationship between reporters and their sources. And, as can be the case, bright light isn’t always flattering. Messages between Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died by suicide in 2019, and journalists Michael Wolff and Landon Thomas Jr. are frequently chummy and, in one case, show Wolff giving Epstein advice on how to deal with the media — a line journalists are taught not to cross. Wolff specializes in the “you are there” inside accounts that are possible with intensive reporting, though some of his work has been questioned. People frequently see journalists in public settings, conducting an interview or asking questions at a news conference. Private phone calls, texts or messages — where reporters try to ingratiate themselves with sources who may not otherwise be inclined to give information — are inherently different. But ethical rules remain and are followed by most in American journalism. ▶ Read more about Epstein’s emails and journalists US prosecutor in Wyoming promises crackdown on pot in national parks and on other public lands Getting high around a campfire in a national park, especially in Wyoming, is more likely to get you prosecuted under a new Justice Department policy regarding marijuana use on federal land. The guidance reverses a policy from the end of Joe Biden’s presidency that “significantly curtailed” federal prosecution of misdemeanor marijuana offenses, according to U.S. Attorney for Wyoming Darin Smith. Smith has been implementing the policy since it came out in September, he said. His office and the DOJ declined to provide the document or the previous policy to The Associated Press. Wyoming is home to two busy national parks, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and like many Western states has thousands of square miles of federal land where the policy applies. How many citations for marijuana are issued among those parks’ more than 8 million visitors each year was not readily available. Smith said his office handles thousands of cases and has not tracked recent minor marijuana prosecutions. ▶ Read more about pot and the parks How national parks will reopen after government shutdown closures The country’s national parks largely stayed open with limited staffing. Outside groups and state governments picked up the tab during the shutdown to keep visitor centers running and help with trash cleanup at many parks. And the Trump administration tapped into previously collected entrance fees to pay for cleaning restrooms and other basic services. But the efforts didn’t stop vandals from defacing rock features along Devils Garden Trail in Arches National Park in Utah and toppling a stone wall at Devil’s Den in Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania. What’s next: National Park Service employees were ordered back to work Thursday. It will take time for rangers to fully assess parks, including backcountry areas, and more damage could yet be discovered, said Kristen Brengel of the National Parks Conservation Association. No fees were collected during the shutdown, costing parks almost $1 million a day in lost revenue. What will happen to federal workers as the government reopens About 1.25 million federal workers haven’t been paid since Oct. 1, missing about $16 billion in wages, according to official estimates. The employees either were furloughed or worked without pay in agencies across the government. Many struggled to make ends meet during that time, and the regional economy around Washington took a hit. What’s next: The Office of Personnel Management, which manages the civil service, posted on the social platform X that federal workers are expected to be back Thursday, saying “employees are expected to begin the workday on time. Normal operating procedures are in effect.” The pay they are owed will come in by Nov. 19 and go out in four separate tranches, depending on the agency, according to a senior administration official. ▶ Read more about how the government is reopening Trump to welcome the Saudi crown prince with arrival ceremony, deal signings and lavish dinner It’s not an official state visit, but the White House is preparing to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman next week with the pomp and circumstance that is typical of one. The crown prince’s day at the White House next Tuesday will begin with an arrival ceremony on the sweeping South Lawn and a subsequent greeting on the South Portico, according to a senior White House official. Then Trump will host him in the Oval Office for a bilateral meeting, followed by a signing and lunch in the Cabinet Room where the U.S. and Saudi Arabia will formalize multiple economic and defense agreements, said the official, granted anonymity to discuss the administration’s planning. Later in the evening, the White House will hold an East Room dinner hosted and planned by first lady Melania Trump. His visit is billed as an official working visit because Prince Mohammed is not technically a head of state, the official said. — Seung Min Kim and Michelle L. Price Switzerland to boost US investment as deal struck to lower tariffs on Swiss goods to 15% The country announced plans to invest $200 billion in the United States through 2028 as it finalized a deal to slash U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods. Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the Trump administration agreed to cut tariffs on most Swiss goods to 15% — the same level imposed on the neighboring European Union — from 39%, the highest rate on any Western country. Parmelin hailed the deal as a result of “new momentum generated by the commitment of the American president” and said it would take “several weeks” to take effect. The White House confirmed the deal Friday, adding that companies from Switzerland and tiny Liechtenstein would invest $67 billion of the $200 billion next year. It said the investments would create thousands of jobs “in a number of sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace, construction, advanced manufacturing, gold manufacturing, and energy infrastructure.” At Trump’s urging, Bondi says US will investigate Epstein’s ties to Clinton and other political foes Acceding to the president’s demands, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she ordered a top federal prosecutor to investigate sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to Trump foes, including former President Bill Clinton. The announcement caps an eventful week in which congressional Republicans released nearly 23,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate and House Democrats seized on emails mentioning Trump. Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years, did not explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men he mentioned in a social media post demanding the probe have been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein’s victims. The demand — and Bondi’s quick acquiescence — is the latest example of the erosion of the DOJ’s traditional independence from the White House under Trump. It is also an extraordinary attempt at deflection. For decades Trump himself has been scrutinized for his closeness to Epstein — though he, too, has not been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein’s victims. ▶ Read more about Bondi’s announcement and Trump’s demand Government will release September jobs report next week after end of shutdown The Labor Department report will come Thursday, a month and a half late, marking the beginning of the end of the data drought caused by the 43-day federal government shutdown . The statistical blackout meant that the Federal Reserve, businesses, policymakers and investors have largely been in the dark about inflation, job creation, GDP growth and other measures of economic health since late summer. Thomas Simons and Michael Bacolas at Jefferies, a financial firm, wrote Friday that over 30 reports from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau were delayed by the political standoff. The Labor Department did not release its weekly report on unemployment benefits for seven straight weeks. That report is seen as a potential early indicator of where the labor market is headed. Labor did release its September consumer price index on Oct. 24, nine days late. An exception was made because of its urgency. Trump drops tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruit as pressure builds on consumer prices The president signed an executive order Friday to get rid of tariffs on a broad swath of commodities. It’s part of a response to pressure from consumers who complain prices are too high. The move comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue , resulting in big wins for Democrats in races in Virginia and New Jersey. FAA eases flight cuts at 40 US airports, but some restrictions remain The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it plans to roll back some of the restrictions on commercial flights it implemented at 40 major U.S. airports during the shutdown. The agency says the current mandatory 6% flight cuts are being downgraded to 3% even though the record 43-day shutdown ended Nov. 12. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has repeatedly said restrictions would remain until staffing at air traffic control facilities stabilizes and safety metrics improve. The unprecedented order , in place since Nov. 7, has affected thousands of flights. The head of the FAA said troubling data showed the measure was needed to ease pressure on the aviation system as the shutdown entered its second month and controller absences rose. Unpaid for more than a month, many controllers cited financial strain and the need to take on side jobs. The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6%. The FAA originally had a 10% target, but officials held off on further rate increases because they said more controllers were coming to work amid news that Congress was close to reaching a deal to end the shutdown. Trump has no issue with phone records provision The president has no objections to language, tucked into a bill to reopen the government, that would allow senators to sue when a federal official searches their electronic records without their knowledge, according to a senior White House official. Trump has indicated privately that he does not think that’s a bad provision, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to describe the president’s thinking. The White House had been fully looped in as senators drafted the bill, which Trump signed into law Wednesday night . But the provision has caused an uproar in the House, where both Democrats and Republicans have decried the language that would allow lawsuits when a senator’s electronic records are searched without prior notification. It would allow senators to sue for up to $500,000 for each violation. The language seems aimed at helping Republican senators pursue damages if their phone records were analyzed by the FBI as part of an investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he was “very angry about it,” and is planning to bring up legislation to repeal it as early as next week. “That was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,” the speaker said earlier this week. The senior White House official did not indicate what Trump would do should such legislation reach his desk. — Seung Min Kim Rubio calls UAE foreign minister to discuss Gaza and Sudan ceasefire efforts Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called the deputy prime minister and foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates to discuss the U.S.-led plan to end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the deteriorating situation in Sudan, where the UAE has been accused of supporting the main rebel group. Rubio and Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed discussed “collective efforts to implement” President Donald Trump’s Gaza proposal, which is currently awaiting endorsement by the U.N. Security Council, the State Department said. During Friday’s call, Rubio “also emphasized the importance of achieving a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan,” it said in a statement. Rubio on Wednesday had decried the humanitarian situation in Sudan and said “something needs to be done” to cut off weapons and other support from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Asked about allegations that the UAE is backing the RSF, Rubio said the U.S. knows who’s involved and is pushing them to stop. But he did not name any countries. ▶ Read more about the situation in Sudan US military’s 20th strike on alleged drug boat brings death toll to 80 in South America The U.S. military’s 20th strike on a boat accused of transporting drugs has killed four people in the Caribbean Sea, a Pentagon official said Friday. The latest strike happened Monday, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. It brings the death toll from the strikes that began in September to 80. The attack comes as the Trump administration expands the U.S. military’s already large presence in the region by bringing in the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier . The nation’s most advanced warship is expected to arrive in the coming days after traveling from the Mediterranean Sea. — Ben Finley Air traffic controllers get 70% of back pay from the shutdown Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers received 70% of their back pay Friday for working during the shutdown. A number of controllers called out of work during the shutdown as they dealt with the financial pressure from going without pay for so long. Some controllers even got side jobs to help make ends meet. That led to delays and other flight disruptions when the Federal Aviation Administration ran short of controllers at airport towers and other radar facilities. Controller staffing improved significantly earlier this week as the shutdown drew to a close. Duffy said earlier this week that controllers would receive the rest of their back pay in the next few paychecks. Duffy and President Donald Trump have also proposed that controllers who didn’t miss a shift during the shutdown should receive $10,000 bonuses. But the details of exactly who might get those checks haven’t been released. House Democrats press the FAA and DOT for answers on flight cuts Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen. “It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” Friday’s letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20. The FAA on Wednesday froze reductions at 6%, shortly before a deal was reached to end the shutdown. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA. Trump to attend world economic conference in Davos The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum’s meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced. The annual meeting in the Swiss Alps draws world leaders, business executives, celebrities and, sometimes, U.S. presidents. Trump attended in his first term in 2018 and 2020. — Michelle L. Price ICE recruits state and local agencies to do welfare checks on migrant children Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children. They said the program kicked off Nov. 10 in Florida. The administration launched a similar effort earlier this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE . Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors . Under the Biden administration, officials tried to release children to eligible sponsors within 30 days, reuniting many families quickly. But there were problems , including some children released to adults who forced them to work illegally. Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration’s efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children. New US political maps spur fears in disparate places The effects of the rush to redraw U.S. political maps ahead of next year’s midterm elections can be seen in the contrasts between two very different places now in the same Missouri congressional district. The 18th and Vine area in Kansas City is predominately Black, once known for jazz joints and the meeting that created professional baseball’s National Negro League when the established major leagues barred Black players. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops. People in both areas worry about being ignored in the new district. The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville’s decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts. But their differences are deeper and extend to issues such as health care, education and gun rights."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/peptide-injections-risks-side-effects-6f0d391b270f5008932cba909b8fef07","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:04:26+00:00","title":"Unapproved Peptide Drugs Gain Popularity Among Celebrities and Wellness Influencers, Sparking Health Concerns","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Unapproved peptide drugs are gaining popularity among celebrities, fitness influencers, and wellness communities as a means to build muscle, lose weight, and appear younger.

Online stores will offer injectable vials for $300 to $600 each. Longevity and wellness clinics offer in-office evaluations and injections, sometimes with membership fees of thousands of dollars per month. But many of the products have never been extensively studied in humans, raising concerns that they could cause allergic reactions, metabolic problems and other dangerous side effects. Here’s a closer look at the science, the hype and the potential risks surrounding the trend. What are peptides? Within the human body, peptides are short chains of amino acids that perform essential functions. Insulin , for example, controls blood sugar levels and helps break down foods into energy. Likewise the popular weight loss drugs, GLP-1s — short for glucagon-like peptides — are based on a hormone found in the intestines that helps regulate blood sugar. The Food and Drug Administration has approved both substances as drugs. But there are many more peptides that have never been approved by regulators as safe and effective, though some have shown interesting study results in rodents and other animals. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. Why are peptides so popular right now? Synthesized peptides are not new. Some doctors have prescribed them for decades off-label, or for unapproved uses, in patients with gastric ulcers, nervous system disorders and other conditions. In recent years, peptides have become a focus for wellness gurus and other public figures with large online followings. That’s driven interest in using obscure peptides for unsubstantiated uses like healing injuries, improving complexion and even extending life. Peptides in this group include an alphabet soup of injectable compounds, including BPC-157, thymosin alpha, GHK-Copper and many more. Some are banned by sports regulators as doping substances . Experts who have studied the field are particularly concerned that some people are combining multiple peptides. “These influencers are often advocating taking a stack of peptides each month, so it could be two, three, four different peptides,” said Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research Translational Institute. “This is really what I consider dangerous.” Interest in the trend is being amplified by celebrities. Joe Rogan has repeatedly talked about using BPC-157 to recover from injuries. Jennifer Aniston has talked about using weekly peptide injections to improve her skin and currently serves as a paid spokesperson for a company selling peptide-enriched supplements. “If any celebrity is using a peptide, and they’re saying this is what worked for me, then of course it’s going to be more mainstream and people are going to be looking into it,” said Kay Robins, a clinical nurse and operator of Pure Alchemy Wellness, a clinic outside of San Diego that sells peptide infusions and injections. Robins says she no longer offers BPC-157 and other peptides that have been targeted by the FDA. How are peptides regulated by the FDA? Most of the unproven peptides promoted online are technically being sold illegally. Any substance that is injected to produce a health benefit or prevent a medical condition is classified as a drug, which cannot be sold without FDA approval. The agency considers many peptides to be biologics , the most complicated and potentially high-risk type of drugs, requiring extra precautions in their manufacture and storage. In recent years, the agency has added more than two dozen peptides to a list of substances that should not be produced by pharmacies due to safety risks. Some companies market their peptides as dietary supplements, particularly those sold as pills, gummies or powders. While dietary supplements are less tightly regulated than drugs, the FDA still requires them to only contain ingredients found on a list of approved substances. Most peptides are not on that list and therefore are ineligible to be sold as supplements. Experts generally agree that consuming peptides by mouth likely has little or no effect, since they will dissolve in the gut. Who is making these peptides? Most of the injectable peptides sold in the U.S. are produced by compounding pharmacies , which custom-mix medications that aren’t available from drug manufacturers. Pharmacies are regulated at the state level and are generally not subject to the same scrutiny as companies overseen by FDA. In recent years, compounding pharmacies have jumped into the market for blockbuster GLP-1 drugs. Under FDA regulations, compounding pharmacies can produce their own versions of a prescription drug when there’s a shortage. Earlier this year the FDA determined that the shortage of GLP-1s had ended , meaning compounders were expected to halt production. But many have continued making custom versions of the drugs — adding extra ingredients like vitamin B, which they say benefits patients. “There had never been the monetary incentive to push the envelope of what is legally permissible with compounding before,” said Nathaniel Lacktman, a lawyer specializing in FDA-related issues. “The dollars weren’t there.” Some of the industry’s new production capacity has gone into producing unapproved peptides, such as BPC-157. The trend recently caught the attention of the FDA, which has added more than two dozen peptides to an interim list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety concerns. What’s the connection between peptides and the MAHA movement? Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among those who have touted the potential benefits of peptides. He has repeatedly vowed to end “FDA’s war” on peptides, which have become popular among many followers of his Make America Healthy Again movement . Some of Kennedy’s friends and associates are also prominent marketers of peptides, including self-described “biohacker” Gary Brecka and functional medicine physician and author Dr. Mark Hyman. Some in the peptide field expect Kennedy to roll back FDA’s restrictions on the industry, which could include releasing a list of peptides that the agency will no longer try to keep off the market. ___ AP video journalist Javier Arciga contributed to this story from San Diego ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz on Friday, a U.S. official said, turning the ship into Iranian territorial waters in the first-such interdiction in months in the strategic waterway . Iran did not acknowledge the seizure, though it comes as Tehran has been increasingly warning it can strike back after facing a 12-day war in June with Israel that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites. The ship, the Talara, had been traveling from Ajman, United Arab Emirates, onward to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted it, said the U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats approaching the Talara. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible “state activity” forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters. Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had “lost contact” with the tanker, which was carrying high sulphur gasoil.

Those attacks began after U.S. President Donald Trump in his first term in office unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In May 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024. Those attacks found themselves subsumed by the Iranian-backed Houthis assaults targeting ships during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which drastically reduced shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor. The years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, exploded into a full-scale 12-day war in June. Iran long has threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-israel-gaza-refugee-asyslum-south-africa-7d5dcbacae38e3564f77e0576a9eaaa1","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:03:25+00:00","title":"South Africa Investigates Mysterious Flight of Gaza Palestinians to Johannesburg","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A chartered flight carrying over 150 Palestinians from Gaza arrived in Johannesburg without proper travel documents, leading South Africa’s intelligence services to launch an investigation.

The plane landed Thursday morning at O.R. Tambo International Airport, but passengers were not allowed to disembark until late that night after immigration interviews with the Palestinians found they could not say where or how long they were staying in South Africa, South Africa’s border agency said. It said the Palestinians also did not have exit stamps or slips that would normally be issued by Israeli authorities to people leaving Gaza. The actions of South African authorities in initially refusing to allow the passengers off the plane provoked fierce criticism from non-governmental organizations, who said the 153 Palestinians — who included families with children and one woman who is nine months pregnant — were kept in dire conditions on the plane, which was extremely hot and had no food or water. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said there was an investigation to uncover how the Palestinians came to South Africa via a stopover in Nairobi, Kenya. “These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here,” Ramaphosa said. Palestinians being ‘exploited’ The Palestinian Embassy in South Africa said in a statement the flight was arranged by “an unregistered and misleading organization that exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner. This entity later attempted to disown any responsibility once complications arose.” It didn’t name who chartered the flight, but an Israeli military official, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential information, said an organization called Al-Majd arranged the transport of about 150 Palestinians from Gaza to South Africa. The official said that Israel escorted buses organized by Al-Majd that brought Palestinians from a meeting point in the Gaza Strip to the Kerem Shalom crossing. Then buses from Al-Majd picked the Palestinians up and brought them to Ramon airport in Israel, where they were flown out of the country. South African authorities said 23 of the Palestinians had traveled onwards to other countries, without naming those countries, but 130 remained and were allowed in after intervention from South Africa’s Ministry of Home Affairs and an offer by an NGO called Gift of the Givers to accommodate them. “Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country, and out of compassion, out of empathy, we must receive them and be able to deal with the situation that they are facing,” Ramaphosa said. Shadowy operation The secretive nature of the flight raised fears among rights groups that it marked an attempt by the Israeli government to push Palestinians from Gaza. Israel’s foreign ministry referred questions to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli authority responsible for implementing civilian policies in the Palestinian territories. It said the Palestinians on the charter plane left the Gaza Strip after it received approval from a third country to receive them as part of an Israeli government policy allowing Gaza residents to leave. It didn’t name the third country. Around 40,000 people have left Gaza since the start of the war under the policy. Israel’s government had embraced a pledge by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty Gaza permanently of its more than 2 million Palestinians — a plan rights groups said would amount to ethnic cleansing. At the time, Trump said they would not be allowed to return . Trump has since backed away from this plan and brokered a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas that allows Palestinians to remain in Gaza. South African leader Ramaphosa said that it appeared the Palestinians who arrived in Johannesburg were being “flushed out” of Gaza, without elaborating. The comment followed allegations by two South African NGO representatives who claimed that Al-Majd was affiliated with Israel and working to remove Palestinians from Gaza. They offered no evidence for the claims and COGAT didn’t respond to a request for comment on those allegations. Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman, one of those to allege involvement by what he called “Israel’s front organizations,” said this was the second plane to arrive in South Africa in mysterious circumstances after one that landed with more than 170 Palestinians onboard on Oct. 28. The arrival of that flight was not announced by authorities. Sooliman said the passengers on the latest plane did not initially know where they were going and were given no food for the two days it took to travel to Johannesburg. “They were given nothing on the plane itself and this must be challenged and investigated,” Sooliman said. South Africa has long been a supporter of the Palestinian cause and a critic of Israel and has led the international pro-Palestinian movement by accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in a highly contentious case at the United Nations’ top court. Israel denies committing genocide and has denounced South Africa as the “legal arm” of Hamas. The people that ended up in South Africa underlined the desperation of Palestinians following a two-year war that has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and reduced the territory to rubble. The ministry’s death toll does not distinguish between militants and civilians, but it says more than half of those killed were women and children. A fragile ceasefire is in place. Jerusalem-based organization An organization called Al-Majd Europe has previously been linked to facilitating travel for Palestinians out of Gaza. It describes itself on its website as a humanitarian organization founded in 2010 in Germany and based in Jerusalem that provides aid and rescue efforts to Muslim communities in conflict zones. The website does not list office phone numbers or its exact address. It states that Al-Majd Europe works with a variety of organizations including 15 international agencies, but no organizations are listed and a “will be announced soon” message was displayed in that section on Friday. Another message that appeared Friday on the website said people were impersonating it to request money or cryptocurrency “under the pretext of facilitating travel or humanitarian aid.” Al-Majd Europe didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent to an email address given on its site. ___ Imray reported from Cape Town, South Africa, and Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

Kennedy has vowed to end “FDA’s war” on peptides and other alternative treatments that are embraced by many in his Make America Healthy Again movement. Some of Kennedy’s friends and associates are among the biggest proponents, including self-described “biohacker” and “longevity expert” Gary Brecka, who sells peptide injectables, patches and nasal sprays through his website for $350 to $600 each. In a May appearance on Brecka’s podcast, Kennedy again promised to “end the war at FDA” on peptides, stem cells , psychedelics and other fringe therapies. “Music to my ears,” Brecka replied. Brecka declined to be interviewed for this story. Peptides are now part of the ‘circus’ of unproven wellness products Peptides are essentially the building blocks of more complex proteins. Inside the human body, peptides trigger hormones needed for growth, metabolism and healing. The FDA has approved a number of peptides as medications, including insulin for diabetics who don’t naturally produce it and human growth hormone for children with developmental disorders caused by low levels of the hormone. A closer look at the unapproved peptide injections promoted by influencers and celebrities But many other peptides promoted online have never been approved, making them technically illegal to market as drugs. Under current FDA guidance these peptides also are ineligible for compounding — the process in which pharmacies mix made-to-order medications for patients. That hasn’t stopped celebrities and influencers from touting them. Joe Rogan , for example, has repeatedly praised BPC-157, a peptide derived from acids found in the gut. “I had tendonitis in my elbow, I started using BPC-157 and it was gone in two weeks,” Rogan told his podcast audience last year. He is among the celebrity clients listed on the website of Ways 2 Well, a Texas-based company that offers peptides, stem cells , vitamin infusions and other alternative treatments. It’s all part of “the circus of unproven, expensive and possibly dangerous” offerings promoted by wellness and longevity clinics , said Topol, who has written about the industry. For $99, Ways 2 Well offers a “peptide consult” with a physician, after which the company ships the peptide vials along with a “full kit with dosing, instructions and syringes,” according to its website. Company founder Brigham Buhler is a former pharmaceutical sales rep. He did not respond to requests for comment. Peptides are often pitched as a ‘natural’ alternative to modern medicine Andrea Steinbrenner, a consulting executive, said she became intrigued by peptides after hearing about their benefits for “longevity, repair, anti-aging and energy,” from an acquaintance who runs a clinic outside of San Diego. Steinbrenner and her husband now receive monthly infusions at the clinic, in addition to daily supplements. “I think peptides are popular right now because we are the aging generation and we are looking for alternatives to modern day medicine,” she said. “I absolutely believe in modern day, western medicine— it’s necessary. But there’s a lot of other things in the universe that the earth supplies.” Andrea Steinbrenner receives an IV infusion at Pure Alchemy Wellness, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025, in Chula Vista, Calif.

Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms. Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 — both of which the FDA has flagged for serious safety risks. Like other peptides sold on Brecka’s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: “research use only.” Research claims are often a ploy to dodge regulators The “research use” language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and “stacking” different drug combinations. One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: “instead of ‘taking’ you are ’researching’ peptides.” Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren’t intended for human use. More from Be Well A study questions melatonin use and heart health but don’t lose sleep over it Age isn’t everything when deciding if a child is ready to be home alone The nest is empty: Parents grapple with mixed emotions after children move out It’s often unclear whether such peptides are being produced in the U.S. by pharmacies and mislabeled for research, or whether they are being purchased from chemical manufacturers, many located in China and not subject to FDA drug quality standards. “Research-grade peptides are going to have junk in them,” said Paul Knoepfler, a cellular biologist at the University of California Davis. “They’re going to have chemicals used in the purification process and fragments of peptides that you don’t want.” On platforms like TikTok, companies in China and other countries offer to ship dozens of peptide varieties to the U.S. for as little as $5 a vial. “What’s actually in there?” Knoepfler said. “If someone injects it under their skin, what are they getting?” FDA has worked to restrict peptides for years During the COVID-19 pandemic , the FDA issued over a half-dozen warning letters to businesses promoting peptides with “immune-boosting powers.” Then in 2023, the agency added nearly 20 peptides to a list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety risks. Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses. That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits. One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: “Our basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.” A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA’s list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks. In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded. Some in the industry disagree. “Physicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA’s inaction, they don’t,” said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies. Changes may be coming The FDA, under Kennedy’s authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won’t enforce bans against them. For now, doctors say they are fielding more questions from patients excited about peptides and seeking prescriptions. “Patients should be really asking their health care professionals: Are these medications safe long term?” says Dr. Anita Gupta of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who served on FDA’s compounding committee until earlier this year. “That’s the question I would ask if I was a patient.” ___ AP video journalist Javier Arciga contributed to this story from San Diego. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

rains  flooded their tents  in makeshift displacement camps in Gaza City, as the United Nations warns that Israeli restrictions on aid have left hundreds of thousands of families without adequate shelter.\n\nAbdulrahman Asaliyah, a displaced Palestinian man, told Al Jazeera on Friday that residents’ mattresses, clothes and other belongings were soaked in the flooding.\n\n“We are calling for help, for new tents that can at least protect people from the winter cold,” he said, explaining that nearly two dozen people had been working for hours to get the water to drain from the area.\n\n“This winter rain is a blessing from God, but there are families who no longer wish for it to fall, fearing for the lives of their children and their own survival,” Asaliyah said.\n\nGaza’s civil defence agency said Friday’s flooding primarily affected Palestinians in the north of the Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people have returned following last month’s  ceasefire agreement  between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFlooding was also reported in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah, said the rescue agency, which urged the international community to do more to “address the suffering” of Palestinians whose homes were destroyed in Israel’s two-year war on the enclave.\n\n“We urge the swift delivery of homes, caravans, and tents to these displaced families to help alleviate their suffering, especially as we are at the beginning of winter,” it said in a statement.\n\nWhile the October 10 ceasefire has allowed more aid to get into the Gaza Strip, the UN and other humanitarian groups say Palestinians still lack adequate food, medicine and other critical supplies, including shelter.\n\nAid groups working to provide shelter assistance in the occupied Palestinian territory said in early November that about 260,000 Palestinian families, totalling almost 1.5 million people, were vulnerable as the cold winter months approached.\n\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)  said this week  that it has enough shelter supplies to help as many as 1.3 million Palestinians.\n\nBut UNRWA said Israel continues to block its efforts to bring aid into Gaza despite the ceasefire deal, which stipulated that humanitarian assistance must be delivered to Palestinians in need.\n\n“We have a very short chance to protect families from the winter rains and cold,” Angelita Caredda, Middle East and North Africa director at the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said in a statement on November 5.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said Palestinians across Gaza have been voicing fears that this winter would be particularly difficult due to the lack of safe shelter.\n\n“It only rained for a couple of minutes – 30 minutes or so … [and]

Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine before starting immunotherapy can significantly improve survival rates for patients with advanced cancers such as lung cancer and metastatic melanoma.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/ethiopia-confirms-first-outbreak-of-marburg-virus","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:50:23Z","title":"Ethiopia confirms first outbreak of Marburg virus","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ethiopia has confirmed its first-ever outbreak of Marburg virus disease, with nine cases reported in the Omo region in the southern part of the country.

As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/several-people-killed-and-injured-as-bus-crashes-into-stop-in-sweden","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"18:01:45+00:00","title":"Three people killed as bus crashes into stop in Sweden","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus crash in central Stockholm, specifically in the Ostermalm district near the Royal Institute of Technology, killed at least three people and injured three others, all of whom were pedestrians.

People were screaming and trying to help the injured.\n\nShe said she saw both injured and dead people lying on the ground. “There must have been more people under the bus,” she said.\n\nA nurse by profession, she and another man who was a doctor, offered their help to police when they arrived.\n\n“They told us to stand next to the dead bodies,” she said. “I thought it was an exercise at first. That maybe they were dolls. It was so unreal. Chaos.”\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\n\n“I have received the tragic news that several people have died and been injured at a bus stop in central Stockholm,” he wrote on X.\n\n“People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home.

has introduced a resolution in the United States Congress to recognise Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza as a genocide.\n\nWhile the proposal released on Friday has little chance of passing in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, it underscores the growing criticism of Israel in US politics.\n\nIf the resolution did pass, it would officially recognise that “Israel has committed the crime of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza” and call for an end to the transfer of weapons suspected of being used to commit atrocities to the US ally.\n\nThe bill also backs “facilitating investigations and domestic proceedings and taking action, including imposing targeted, lawful sanctions, with respect to the State of Israel”.\n\nThe resolution has been co-sponsored by 20 other Democratic members of Congress, including some prominent legislators.\n\nKey progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, potential presidential candidate Ro Khanna, and Gen Z Congressman  Maxwell Alejandro Frost , who is seen as a rising star in the party, are backing the measure.\n\nThe resolution comes as the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that granted Israel $3.8bn in US military aid annually is set to expire next year – likely renewing the debate over the assistance as Israeli officials seek a new package.\n\nOver the past two years, the US government provided additional assistance to Israel to help fund the war on Gaza – totalling  more than $21bn .\n\nIsrael’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, including at least 20,000 children, and turned most of the territory into rubble.\n\nThroughout the war, Israel imposed a blockade on aid to Gaza, sparking a  deadly famine  in the enclave.\n\nEven after a US-brokered ceasefire came into effect last month, Israel has  continued to restrict  the entry of food and fuel to Gaza. The Israeli military has also been carrying out air strikes and shootings in Gaza daily in violation of the truce.\n\nTlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, said the genocide in Gaza is ongoing.\n\n“Since the so-called ‘ceasefire’ was announced, Israeli forces haven’t stopped killing Palestinians,” the congresswoman said in a statement on Friday..\n\n“Impunity only enables more atrocity. As our government continues to send a blank check for war crimes and ethnic cleansing, Palestinian children’s smiles are extinguished by bombs and bullets that say ‘made in the USA’.”\n\nUnited Nations investigators and leading rights groups – including Amnesty International and  Israel’s B’Tselem  – have concluded that the Israeli offensive is a genocide.\n\nA UN convention defines  genocide as  “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.\n\nGenocidal acts include killing and injuring members of the targeted group, preventing births and imposing “conditions of life calculated to bring about” the physical destruction of the group.\n\nTlaib’s resolution quotes public statements by Israeli political and military officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog – calling for mass violence and collective punishment against Palestinians.\n\n“This place will be a fallow land. They will not be able to live here,” Colonel Erez Eshel said in November 2023.\n\nDespite the growing consensus among rights experts that the war in Gaza is a genocide, only a fraction of Congress members have adopted the label when describing the Israeli offensive.\n\nIn addition to the 21 House Democrats backing the resolution, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and progressive Senator  Bernie Sanders  have also accused Israel of genocide.\n\nExperts say the description is important because the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide invokes a global responsibility to stop the atrocities and hold the perpetrators responsible.\n\nMore than 100 rights groups have endorsed Tlaib’s congressional proposal.\n\n“This resolution is an important step towards recognising Israel’s actions against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip for what they are – genocide,” Elizabeth Rghebi, Middle East advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.\n\n“The US ratified the Genocide Convention, which imposes a duty on states to prevent and punish the crime. Amnesty International calls on all members of Congress to urgently support this resolution and ensure the US begins taking the actions necessary to prevent and punish Israel’s  genocide in Gaza .”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/trip-of-suffering-gaza-evacuee-details-24-hour-journey-to-south-africa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"21:34:01Z","title":"‘Trip of suffering’: Gaza evacuee details 24-hour journey to South Africa","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of 153 Palestinians, including Loay Abu Saif and his family, evacuated from the Gaza Strip through a transit route involving Israel and Kenya, landing in South Africa without proper departure stamps.

Palestinians that landed in South Africa without the correct paperwork this week, says the group did not know where they would end up when they left Israel.\n\nLoay Abu Saif, who fled Gaza with his wife and children, told Al Jazeera on Friday that the journey out of the battered and besieged enclave was a “trip of suffering”.\n\n“We were not too convinced that any group … would be able to make this kind of evacuation,” Abu Saif said from Johannesburg, a day after the chartered plane his group was on landed at the city’s OR Tambo International Airport.\n\n“I can say I feel safe … which means a lot for Palestinians, especially for those in Gaza,” he added.\n\nDetails are slowly emerging of a  controversial transit scheme  run by a non-profit, through which activists say Israel is encouraging the displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza by helping them settle in other countries.\n\nBased on Abu Saif’s testimony to Al Jazeera, the Israeli military appears to have facilitated his group’s transfer through an Israeli airport.\n\nThe flight carrying Abu Saif left Israel’s Ramon Airport and transited through Nairobi, Kenya, before landing in Johannesburg on Thursday morning, where authorities did not initially allow the passengers to disembark as the Palestinians did not have departure stamps from Israel on their documents.\n\nAll in all, the journey lasted more than 24 hours and involved a change of planes.\n\nAbu Saif said his family left Gaza without knowing their final destination. They only learned they were bound for Johannesburg when boarding their connecting flight in Nairobi.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, Jordan, on Friday, said Israel was yet to comment on the issue, but it was unlikely the Palestinians who left did so without “Israeli coordination”.\n\n“Nobody can approach that imaginary yellow line [in Gaza] without being shot at. These people had to be bused through the yellow line, through the 53 percent of Gaza that the Israeli army still controls and is operating in out of Gaza, through Israel to the Ramon airport,” she reported.\n\nAccording to Abu Saif, his wife registered the family with a nonprofit called Al-Majd Europe, with headquarters in Germany with an office in Jerusalem, according to their website.\n\nThe group advertised the registration form on social media, he revealed. On how he was selected, Abu Saif said the process appeared to focus on families with children and required a valid Palestinian travel document, along with security clearance from Israel.\n\n“This is all what I know about the criteria,” he said.\n\nWhen asked whether he knew in advance when they would leave Gaza, he said no timelines were given.\n\n“They told us … we will inform you one day before – that’s what happened,” he said, adding that the organisation told them not to carry any personal bags or luggage except relevant documents.\n\nIn terms of cost, people were charged about $1,400-$2,000 per person for the trip, Abu Saif said. Parents also paid the same fee per child or baby they carried with them.\n\nAfter they were selected to leave, Abu Saif and his family were taken by bus from the southern Gaza city of Rafah to the Karem Abu Salem crossing (called Kerem Shalom in Israel), along the border with Israel, where they underwent checks before being transferred onward towards Israel’s Ramon Airport.\n\nHe said their travel documents were not stamped by Israeli authorities, but he thought it was just a routine procedure since there were no Palestinian border officials in Gaza.\n\n“We realised the problem … when we reached South Africa and they were asking us … ‘Where are you coming from?'” Abu Saif said.\n\nThe group that organised the trip, Al-Majd Europe, said they would be able to help his family for a week or two, after which they would be on their own, Abu Saif said. Al-Majd did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.\n\nHowever, Abu Saif added that the evacuees had made their own plans going forward.\n\n“They have their papers for Australia, Indonesia, or Malaysia. We can say that 30 percent of the total number of passengers left South Africa on the same day or within the first two days,” he said, while others may choose to stay for several reasons, including receiving treatment.\n\nSouth African authorities reported that of the 153 Palestinians who landed on Thursday, 130 entered the country, while 23 transferred to other destinations.\n\n“People have calculated that the cost of life in any country … will be cheaper compared to the cost of living in Gaza,” said Abu Saif."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/jailed-tunisian-opposition-figure-hospitalised-amid-hunger-strike-family","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:00:19+00:00","title":"Jailed Tunisian opposition figure hospitalised amid hunger strike: Family","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jawhar Ben Mbarek, a key opposition leader in Tunisia, has been hospitalised due to severe dehydration and kidney toxicity after over two weeks on a hunger strike protesting his detention since February 2023.

figure hospitalised amid hunger strike: Family\n\nJailed Tunisian  opposition figure Jawhar Ben Mbarek  has been hospitalised due to severe dehydration, his family has said, as his health continues to deteriorate after more than two weeks on hunger strike.\n\nBen Mbarek, the cofounder of Tunisia’s main opposition alliance, the National Salvation Front, started his hunger strike on October 29 to protest his  detention in jail since February 2023 .\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Ben Mbarek’s sister, Dalila Ben Mbarek Msaddek, warned that her brother’s health had now “severely deteriorated” and doctors detected “a highly dangerous toxin” affecting his kidneys.\n\nMsaddek said Ben Mbarek had “received treatment but refused nutritional supplements” at the hospital where he was transferred on Thursday night, insisting on continuing his now 17-day protest.\n\nThe politician was discharged from hospital on Friday afternoon and returned to prison, Msaddek added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ben Mbarek’s lawyer Hanen Khmiri said he had “faced torture” at the hands of guards at Belli prison, as they attempted to force him to end his protest.\n\n“He was severely beaten, we saw fractures and bruises on his body,” Khmiri said, adding that she had filed a complaint with the public prosecutor, who promised to investigate.\n\n“He told me that four of the prison guards beat him severely in a place where there is no surveillance camera,” she said.\n\nBen Mbarek is one of the most prominent opponents of Tunisian strongman President Kais Saied, who has been in power since 2019.\n\nIn April, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison on charges of “conspiracy against state security” and “belonging to a terrorist group”, in a  mass trial  of opposition figures slammed by human rights groups as politically motivated.\n\nBen Mbarek has denied the charges, which he has called fabricated.\n\nRights groups have warned of a sharp decline in civil liberties in Tunisia since a sweeping power grab by Saied in July 2021, when he dissolved parliament and expanded executive power so he could rule by decree.\n\nThat decree was later enshrined in a new constitution, ratified by a widely boycotted 2022 referendum. Media figures and lawyers critical of Saied have also been prosecuted and detained under a harsh “fake news” law enacted the same year.\n\nLast week, Ben Mbarek’s family and prominent members of Tunisia’s political opposition announced they would join him in a  collective hunger strike .\n\nAmong the participants was Issam Chebbi, the leader of the centrist Al Joumhouri (Republican) Party, who is also behind bars after being convicted in the same mass trial as Ben Mbarek earlier this year.\n\nRached Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old leader of the Ennahdha party, who is also serving a hefty prison sentence, also said he would join the protest.

Department"],"content":"Published: 2025-11-14T19:41:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump asks Justice Department to investigate Bill Clinton over Epstein ties\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has called on the Department of Justice to investigate ties between one of his Democratic predecessors, Bill Clinton, and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut the request comes shortly after a trove of newly released emails raised questions about Trump’s own relationship with Epstein.\n\nOn Friday, Trump took to social media to once again frame the emails as a distraction. He compared them to an investigation into ties between Russian election interference and his presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n“This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump  wrote , framing the emails as a “hoax”.\n\nHe also sought to shift scrutiny of his actions onto Democrats and financial institutions, arguing that they had deeper relationships with Epstein than he did.\n\n“Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat’s problem, not the Republican’s problem!” Trump wrote, before adding: “Don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”\n\nIn the  second  of two lengthy posts, Trump said he would ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate former President Clinton, as well as Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, venture capitalist Reid Hoffman and the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBondi  responded  within hours. On the social media platform X, she thanked Trump for his request and explained she had assigned US Attorney Jay Clayton to the probe.\n\n“The Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people,” she added.\n\nThe Epstein scandal has proven to be an enduring headache for Trump during his second administration, as he faces bipartisan pressure to release the full slate of documents pertaining to the case and address his own involvement.\n\nA wealthy financier, Epstein was known to socialise with powerful figures, including Trump, Clinton and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, a former prince in the United Kingdom whose involvement resulted  in the loss of his royal titles  last month.\n\nThose associations have long drawn questions about how Epstein may have been shielded from accountability.\n\nHundreds of women  have come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse and trafficking. In 2008, Epstein was convicted in Florida of sexually abusing a minor and solicitation, but critics saw his plea deal as overly lenient.\n\nAt the time of his death by suicide in 2019, he was in jail, facing federal sex-trafficking charges. The circumstances of his death have fuelled conspiracy theories, as has the high-profile nature of his social circle, leading some to believe there was a cover-up.\n\nTrump’s own relationship with Epstein came roaring back into the spotlight on Wednesday, as the  longest government shutdown  in US history came to a close.\n\nThe House of Representatives had come back into session for the first time in 54 days in order to vote on a funding bill that would end the 42-day-long shutdown.\n\nBut that morning, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  released  three excerpted emails from conversations between Epstein, his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and the writer Michael Wolff, all of which discussed Trump. They appeared to suggest Trump knew about Epstein’s sexual relationships.\n\nIn one email, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him.”\n\nIn another, Epstein told Wolff, “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n\nA third email from Wolff suggested Trump had been to Epstein’s house and on his plane, and discussed how Trump might address those visits in a CNN interview.\n\nThe Trump administration quickly leapt into damage control, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing the email release as selectively edited and a Democratic “smear” campaign.\n\nLater that day, however, the Republican leadership on the House Oversight Committee  published  20,000 emails from the Epstein case file, including more conversations about Trump.\n\nIn a 2017 email to Summers, for example, Epstein wrote, “i have met some very bad people ,, none as bad as trump. not one decent cell in his body.. so yes – dangerous.”\n\nIn Friday’s messages, Trump argued that the emails were an attempt to distract from the prolonged government shutdown, during which time Democrats failed to negotiate protections for healthcare subsidies scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\n\n“The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT,” Trump said.\n\nHe also denounced Republicans for backing the push to release more Epstein files, claiming they were siding with Democrats over him.\n\n“Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” he wrote.\n\nThis week is not the first time Trump’s current administration has faced controversy over the Epstein scandal. In February, for instance, Attorney General Bondi told Fox News in a televised interview that she had an Epstein “client list” in her possession: “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.”\n\nThe existence of a supposed “client list” was a key element in conspiracy theories that framed Epstein as blackmailing powerful figures to do his bidding. Some of Trump’s own officials, including Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head Kash Patel, had promoted that conspiracy theory prior to taking office.\n\nBut in July, the Justice Department and FBI issued a joint memo  denying the existence  of a “client list”, stirring backlash among Trump supporters. Bondi maintained she misspoke in the February interview with Fox News.\n\nLater that month,  media reports  emerged that Bondi had also briefed Trump that his name appeared in the full Epstein files, which have yet to be released.\n\nTrump himself addressed his relationship with Epstein that month,  saying he cut ties  with the financier for poaching young female employees from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\n“When I heard about it, I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people,'” Trump told reporters. “And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, ‘Out of here.'”\n\nClinton has likewise faced scrutiny for his ties to Epstein: Before his conviction, the financier visited Clinton at the White House, and Clinton has admitted to travelling on Epstein’s jet.\n\nWhile Clinton has yet to comment on Trump’s threat of an investigation, he has, in the past, denied any knowledge of Epstein’s abuses.\n\n“President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those he has been recently charged in New York,” Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Urena  posted  on social media in 2019.\n\nFinancial institutions have also faced pressure to account for their involvement in Epstein’s affairs.\n\nIn 2023, for instance, Deutsche Bank  agreed to pay a $75m  settlement to survivors of Epstein’s abuses, after a plaintiff alleged that the financial institution profited from his sex-trafficking schemes and failed to flag unusual behaviour.\n\nLater that same year, JP Morgan Chase also struck a deal with Epstein survivors,  agreeing to pay a settlement  of $290m.\n\n“We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes,” the bank said in a statement at the time.\n\nSimilar lawsuits have since been filed, including  complaints last month  against Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY). During hearings this week, those two banking firms have sought to have the lawsuits dismissed.\n\nStill, pressure remains high on the Trump administration, particularly in the wake of the House reconvening.\n\nWith the lower chamber back in session, a new representative was sworn in: Democrat Adelita Grijalva. She provided the critical 218th signature on a discharge petition to force the House to vote on releasing all of the government’s Epstein files.\n\nThe bill was a bipartisan effort, led by Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Ro Khanna, a Democrat.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump supporter, confirmed this week he plans to hold the vote next week, though it faces uncertain odds in the Senate. Johnson has repeatedly downplayed the effort.\n\n“It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it,” Johnson said as he walked with reporters on Wednesday. “I mean, they have 218 signatures. That’s fine. We’ll do it.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/trump-withdraws-support-for-former-maga-champion-marjorie-taylor-greene","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:23:03+00:00","title":"Trump withdraws support for former MAGA champion Marjorie Taylor Greene","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has publicly withdrawn his support from Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her a 'lunatic' and accusing her of going 'far left' and making baseless complaints.

withdraws support for former MAGA champion Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has said he is withdrawing his support for Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling the lawmaker a “lunatic” and accusing her of going “far left”.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform late on Friday, Trump said, “I am withdrawing my support and endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the great state of Georgia.”\n\nThe US leader, labelling Greene “wacky”, said all the lawmaker did was “COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN”, despite his “record achievements” in office.\n\nGreene, a member of the House of Representatives, has long been a reliable ally and fierce defender of Trump, even sporting a Make America Great Again (MAGA) baseball hat at President Joe Biden’s 2024 State of the Union address.\n\nBut in recent months, she has taken positions at odds with the White House and her fellow Republicans, including criticising them during the  just-ended federal government shutdown , saying the Trump administration needed a plan to help people set to lose health insurance subsidies as part of planned cuts.\n\nMore notably, Greene has also become a vocal campaigner for transparency and the full release of files related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – a recurrent scandal that continues to engulf President Trump.\n\nGreene responded to Trump’s announcement on Friday with screenshots of a text message she sent the president about the Epstein case, claiming it “sent him over the edge”.\n\n“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” she wrote on X.\n\n“Most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,” she said.\n\nGreene also claimed Trump is going after her “hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next week’s vote to release the Epstein files”.\n\nPresident Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven’t called him at all, but I did send these text messages today.

The White House claimed the communications “prove nothing”.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged his supporters to move on from the scandal, labelling suggestions that there is an Epstein client list with his name on it a “hoax” pushed by his Democratic opponents.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Greene labelled Trump’s resistance to releasing the files a “huge miscalculation”, adding that she does not believe he has anything to hide.\n\nTrump made no mention of the Epstein issue in his post disowning Greene, claiming the schism between the pair began when he discouraged her from running for senator or governor due to low polling numbers.\n\n“She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls any more, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 US Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic ‘s call every day,” Trump said.\n\nTrump continued that Republicans in Georgia are “fed up with her and her antics” and should they find an alternative to run at the next midterms, that candidate will have his “complete and unyielding support”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status due to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak that began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories and resulting in 5,000 cases and two deaths.

be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:12:47Z","title":"California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom leads a state-level effort to counter the absence of top U.S. federal officials under the Trump administration.

He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/man-jailed-for-smash-and-grab-theft-of-banksys-girl-with-balloon-print","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:40:35+00:00","title":"Man jailed for ‘smash and grab’ theft of Banksy’s Girl with Balloon print","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 49-year-old man, Larry Fraser, was sentenced to 13 months in prison in 2025 for stealing a print of Banksy’s iconic 'Girl with Balloon' artwork from a London gallery in September 2024.

‘smash and grab’ theft of Banksy’s Girl with Balloon print\n\nA man has been sentenced to 13 months in prison by a British court for stealing a print of street artist Banksy’s iconic Girl with Balloon from a London gallery in September last year.\n\nLarry Fraser, 49, was jailed on Friday by a judge in southwest London after he pleaded guilty to the smash-and-grab burglary of the elusive artist’s painting, valued at 270,000 pounds ($355,200).\n\nDespite trying to conceal his identity with a mask, Fraser was caught on camera, and police tracked him down two days after the theft. The artwork was recovered shortly afterwards, according to London’s Metropolitan Police.\n\n“This is a brazen and serious non-domestic burglary,” said Judge Anne Brown, passing the sentence at Kingston Crown Court.\n\nThe Girl with Balloon first appeared on the streets of London’s Shoreditch neighbourhood in 2002, with Banksy creating versions of the painting on London’s South Bank in 2004 and in the occupied West Bank in 2005.\n\nOne version of the painting  shredded itself into pieces  the moment after it was sold for more than one million British pounds ($1.3m) by London auction house Sotheby’s in 2018.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Scott Mather said: “Banksy’s ‘Girl with Balloon’ is known across the world – and we reacted immediately to not just bring Fraser to justice but also reunite the artwork with the gallery.”\n\nThe secretive British street artist has returned to Palestine on multiple occasions to create artworks, including a version of the girl with the red balloon.\n\nIn 2005, he sprayed nine stencilled images at different locations along the illegal,  eight-metre-high (26-foot) separation wall  that Israel has constructed in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThey included a ladder reaching over the wall, a young girl being carried over it by balloons and a window on the grey concrete showing beautiful mountains in the background.\n\nIn 2007, he painted a number of artworks in Bethlehem, including a young girl frisking an Israeli soldier pinned up against a wall.\n\nIn February 2015, he allegedly  sneaked into the Gaza Strip  through a smuggling tunnel and painted three works on the walls of Gaza homes destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the previous year’s conflict.\n\nIn 2017, he  opened the Walled Off Hotel  in Bethlehem, just four metres from Israel’s separation wall.\n\nEarlier this year, authorities  attempted to scrub  a Banksy painting on a London court wall that depicted a judge hitting a protester and was believed to refer to the country’s crackdown on the Palestine Action protest group.\n\nBanksy rose to fame for sharply ironic outdoor graffiti with political themes. Once a small-time graffiti artist from the English city of Bristol, his artwork has become hugely popular worldwide and valuable."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/us-bankruptcy-court-to-approve-deal-with-purdue-pharma-and-sackler-family","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"00:48:09+00:00","title":"US bankruptcy court to approve deal with Purdue Pharma and Sackler family","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. bankruptcy court has approved a $7 billion settlement between Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family to resolve thousands of lawsuits related to the opioid crisis.

approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids.\n\nFriday’s deal, overseen by United States Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane, would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7bn over 15 years, with some of the money going to victims of the opioid crisis.\n\nThe new agreement replaces one the US Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies.\n\nIt could also close a long chapter – and maybe the entire book – on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n\nLawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in US history. Ultimately, lawyers representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue.\n\nThe company filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.\n\nPurdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss”. But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.”\n\nThe saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.\n\nThe US Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids.\n\nIn the new arrangement, entities that don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.\n\nThis time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus, and there has been mostly subdued opposition from individuals.\n\nOut of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted, just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote.\n\nUnlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse.\n\nA handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement.\n\nOthers wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable – something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing.\n\nA Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough.\n\n“The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.\n\nA flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.\n\nMost of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50bn, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.\n\nThere’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or nor any overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say.\n\nBesides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week’s hearing.\n\nThe company would get a name change – to Knoa Pharma – and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026.\n\nFamily members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.\n\nCompany documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.\n\nUnlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue’s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850m would be set aside for them, with more than $100m of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n\nAll of the money for the individual victims would be delivered next year.\n\nAbout 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing.\n\nAssuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each, and those who had them more briefly would get about $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive.\n\nOne woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder.\n\n“Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.\n\nChristopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court.\n\n“Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.”\n\nMost of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate the damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of powerful solar storms, including three coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares, are impacting Earth this week, resulting in vibrant auroral displays visible across the United States, Canada, and Europe.

triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02+00:00","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is facing a significant surge in bear attacks since April 2025, with at least 13 deaths and over 100 injuries reported.

behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/eduardo-bolsonaro-son-of-brazils-ex-president-to-face-obstruction-charge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"00:05:36+00:00","title":"Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazil’s ex-president, to face obstruction charge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has been charged with obstruction of justice by a majority of the Supreme Court panel in Brazil, accused of using threats and international lobbying—particularly in the United States—to interfere with his father's legal case.

majority on a Supreme Court panel in Brazil has voted to bring  Eduardo Bolsonaro , the third child of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, to trial on charges of obstruction of justice.\n\nOn Friday, three of the five justices on the panel accepted an indictment against the younger Bolsonaro, which accused him of using threats to interfere with a court case against his father.\n\nIn September, Brazil’s Supreme Court sentenced Jair Bolsonaro, who led Brazil from 2019 to 2023, to more than 27 years in prison for allegedly plotting to subvert his loss in the 2022 election by means of a coup.\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro has been among his father’s most prominent defenders throughout his myriad legal woes.\n\nAn elected official in the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo travelled multiple times to the United States in the wake of Brazil’s 2022 election, meeting with President Donald Trump and his Republican officials.\n\nIn March, Eduardo announced he would move to the US to petition full-time on behalf of his father.\n\n“I will focus 100 percent of my time on this single cause: to seek justice,” he said in a social media video at the time.\n\nBut a majority of the justices on the Supreme Court panel determined that there was enough evidence to suggest Eduardo’s actions in the US may have amounted to an illegal pressure campaign, designed to sway his father’s court case.\n\n“There is significant evidence that Eduardo Nantes Bolsonaro’s actions aimed to create an environment of institutional and social instability, applying increasing sanctions to Brazilian authorities and causing economic harm to Brazil,” one justice, Alexandre de Moraes, wrote in his opinion.\n\nTwo other justices, Flavio Dino and Cristiano Zanin, joined de Moraes in voting to proceed to trial, granting a prosecutorial request. Voting on the Supreme Court panel remains open until November 25.\n\nAt question is how Eduardo Bolsonaro may have lobbied the Trump administration to take action against Brazil, in order to drop the case against his father.\n\nJair Bolsonaro and Trump have been close allies, and Trump  has shown a willingness  to intervene in the politics of Latin American countries to support fellow right-wing leaders.\n\nIn Jair Bolsonaro’s case, Trump issued a  letter  in July accusing Brazil of censoring right-wing voices like the former president’s. He also threatened to impose steep tariffs if the case against Bolsonaro continued.\n\n“The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,” Trump wrote in the letter, addressed to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\n“This trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”\n\nAn  executive order  that same month declared Brazil’s actions a “national emergency” and an “unusual and extraordinary threat” against US interests.\n\nBy August, Trump had followed through with his economic threats, slapping Brazil with 50 percent tariffs on many of its exports to the US. It was the highest US tariff rate for any country in the world, matched only by  India  later that month.\n\nThe Trump administration also took specific action against Justice de Moraes, who spearheaded the investigation into former President Bolsonaro.\n\nOn July 18, the US Department of State announced it would  strip visas  from de Moraes, his family and “his allies on the court”, though no additional justice was named directly.\n\nThen, on July 30, the US  sanctioned  de Moraes for “engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics”. The sanctions came under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, ordinarily reserved for grave human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nBy September, the sanctions had been  expanded  to include de Moraes’s wife, Viviane Barci de Moraes.\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro has been vocal in his support of Trump’s efforts on behalf of his father. He has also become a frequent presence at the White House and events themed to Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.\n\nAt one event in March, Eduardo was seen conversing at the Trump Hotel with former White House adviser Steve Bannon, while sporting a green hat with a variation on Trump’s slogan: “Make Brazil Great Again.”\n\nIn August, he told BBC News in Washington, DC, that he supported Trump’s tariff campaign against Brazil.\n\n“I admire President Trump. We’ve met several times in his first and second term,” he told the British broadcaster. “We fought first to sanction Alexandre de Moraes. But if President Trump starts with tariffs, I do believe that he is right and I do support him because of that.”\n\nBut on Friday, in a  statement  posted to social media, Eduardo Bolsonaro denounced the Supreme Court panel’s decision to bring him to trial in absentia, calling it a “WITCH HUNT”. He added that he had no control over the sanctions Trump applied, nor the tariffs.\n\n“Tariffs and the application of the Magnitsky Act are neither at my disposal nor illegal,” Eduardo wrote. “It is clear that Moraes wants to convict me.”\n\nHe went on to argue that he believes de Moraes is attempting to use Brazil’s “clean record law” — a tool to prevent corruption in the government — to bar him from running for office in the future. “Can this be called democracy?” he asked.\n\nIf convicted on the obstruction charges, Eduardo Bolsonaro could face a fine and prison time of up to four years.\n\nJust last week, the Supreme Court panel  also rejected  his father’s attempt to reduce or toss his prison sentence. Jair Bolsonaro remains under house arrest while he appeals his conviction."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-11:20","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera: Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, from a G4 geomagnetic storm watch in the US signaling potential disruptions to critical infrastructure, to concerns over misinformation by political figures like Trump regarding Tylenol and autism.

in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report warning that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure — affecting at least 2 billion people and over 3,500 new development sites — threatens billions of lives, endangers health, undermines human rights, and damages ecosystems.

rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has announced a comprehensive social media ban for children under 16, expanding the list to include Reddit and Kick alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known locally as Super Typhoon Uwan, devastated northern Philippines in late November 2025, killing at least 10 people and displacing over 1.4 million, including victims of flash floods, landslides, and structural collapses in provinces like Nueva Vizcaya and Kalinga.

eggs, fatigue and unsexy topics\n\nIt was just their third date when Sophie and her new love interest Dillon visited a fertility clinic.\n\nThe pair had already discussed intimacy with a chronic condition, egg freezing and other \"unsexy topics\".\n\nFor Sophie Richards, 29, those early conversations were just part of the daunting prospect of finding love when you have  endometriosis , which can cause infertility.\n\nThe condition means cells similar to those in the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other parts of the body, which can lead to symptoms including period pain, fatigue, plus pain in the lower tummy and back.\n\nWhen Sophie first met her now fiancé, Wales rugby international Dillon Lewis, she felt she had to be up front.\n\nAt the time, she was freezing her eggs - a process she started because of potential fertility issues from her endometriosis.\n\n\"It can be very challenging, especially with endometriosis or something chronic, or infertility issues like I've struggled with,\" Sophie said.\n\n\"How do you bring that up to someone new and hope it doesn't scare them away?\"\n\nDespite it feeling uncomfortable, she brought the condition up soon after meeting.\n\n\"I was having to explain... about injections and surgeries, and all of that, very unsexy topics to be talking about,\" she added.\n\nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue, similar to the lining of the womb, is found in other areas of the body such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines.\n\nSymptoms can include pelvic pain, heavy periods, pain during or after sex and is associated with infertility.\n\nIt affects around one in 10 women in Wales.\n\nThere's currently no cure for the condition but there are treatments to help ease symptoms including surgery to cut away tissue, or remove part of the organs affected by endometriosis.\n\nSophie credits fiance Dillon with being supportive and keen to learn about the condition.\n\n\"I had plenty of hours of education from Sophie over a G&T, because Sophie was so open about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It made learning a lot easier, but she didn't mind the stupid questions as well.\"\n\nThe Newport-based Dragons prop, 29, who has 57 caps for Wales, said asking questions and being open is key to offering a partner support.\n\n\"Just try to help in whichever way, like I always say 'is there anything I can do' with the answer 99% of the time being no but at least I like to ask... and get a hot water bottle every now and again,\" he added.\n\nSophie, now a women's health advocate and podcaster, said that being with someone supportive, whatever the challenges, was vital.\n\n\"I genuinely don't think I could be with someone who didn't want to understand the endometriosis, because ultimately, I will live with it forever. It's chronic,\" she added.\n\nShe wants more women to feel confident talking about the impact endometriosis can have on sex and intimacy, although acknowledged how daunting it can be.\n\n\"Now I'm an open book...six years ago, I couldn't even say the words periods without flushing red,\" she added.\n\nNatalie Jones, from Cardiff, has endometriosis and  adenomyosis  and is currently waiting for her fourth surgery.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who was diagnosed in 2018, has recently started to date again after a period of ill-health.\n\nThe PhD student described herself as naturally a \"spontaneous person\" but said often she is so exhausted she fears cancelling dates may give the wrong impression that she's unreliable or worse, uninterested.\n\n\"If you're just exhausted sometimes and you have to cancel plans especially in a new relationship that might sound like you're just putting somebody off, or you're unreliable or you're messing someone around,\" she added.\n\nThe academic researcher said it can be particularly complicated when it comes to sex with the extra worry of heavy bleeding or pain.\n\n\"You don't want to set that expectation that intimacy is going to happen by having that discussion too early on but then if one thing leads to another, when do you bring it up, do you stop midway and say, 'oh by the way',\" she said.\n\nThe keen traveller and gym-goer said that while it can be difficult watching friends start to settle down, she doesn't let it affect her.\n\n\"This is something that I can't control, but that doesn't take away from who I am and so if I'm dating or speaking with somebody who isn't prepared to either learn or understand... then that's probably not the right person anyway,\" she added.\n\nPelvic health physiotherapist Pauline-Clare Callaghan said while there has been progress in recent years regarding open discussions around menstrual health and menopause, there's still much more to be done especially in endometriosis-related sexual pain.\n\nThe healthcare professional, who has a special interest in endometriosis, said sexual pain with the condition can be complicated and may relate to the location of scar tissue, adhesions and fibrosis, or pelvic floor muscle being overactive, tight or inflamed.\n\n\"There are effective conservative treatments including pelvic physio but there is a care gap, there are many barriers to addressing sexual pain in endometriosis, including lack of awareness/understanding of support available, shame, embarrassment, cultural issues, and care access issues,\" she said.\n\nFaye Farthing from  Endometriosis UK  said the condition can have a \"huge impact\" on people's sex lives and relationships.\n\n\"Sex can be a challenging topic to discuss with partners, especially if you're new in a relationship, which is why it's vital societal conversations continue around sex and endometriosis to break down the stigma,\" she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is planning noncritical nuclear tests—specifically, system-level evaluations of nuclear weapon components—rather than full nuclear explosions, in response to concerns over China’s nuclear buildup.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797032ldp5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:54:13.259+00:00","title":"Screen Actors Guild Awards changes name from SAG to The Actor Awards","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Screen Actors Guild Awards are rebranding to 'The Actor Awards' presented by Sag-Aftra, the union formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.

Screen Actors Guild Awards changes name from SAG to The Actor Awards\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild Awards, the marquee awards ceremony honouring actors, is getting a new name.\n\nKnown colloquially as the SAG Awards, the awards show will now be dubbed the Actor Awards presented by Sag-Aftra, the labour union representing US film, television and radio actors.\n\n\"Since the beginning, our statue has been called 'The Actor' and we're a show that's entirely about actors, so this new name is a perfect next step in the show's evolution,\" the show's executive producer said on Friday.\n\nThe rebrand comes ahead of the 32nd edition of the star-studded ceremony, which is set for 1 March 2026.\n\nThe award show's executive producer Jon Brockett told the BBC that the name change - which was announced at a board meeting on Friday - gives viewers in more than 190 countries \"an immediate understanding of who we are and what we're about\" - a show about actors honouring actors.\n\n\"Now that our global audience is really growing, people don't always understand what the union name is,\" added awards committee chair JoBeth Williams.\n\n\"But 'the Actor Awards' they recognize and they know they're going to see their favourite actors when they tune in,\" Ms Willams said.\n\nThe Actor trophy also gives a boon to its winners in the run up to the Academy Awards, better  bringing the Oscars race  into focus each year.\n\nThe Oscars, much like the Emmys, Grammys and Golden Globes, are better known by the monikers derived from their respective trophies instead of the organisations and professional academies that back them.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Aftra) merged in 2012 and represent about 160,000 members. The new show name now allows the organisation to fully recognize that merger and align it with the name of the statuette, the union said.\n\nThe name change comes weeks after Sag-Aftra elected The Lord of the Rings star Sean Astin as its new leader.\n\nAstin succeeds The Nanny series star Fran Drescher, who steered the organization through the Hollywood strikes of 2023 during her four-year tenure."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:35:01.407+00:00","title":"What does Trump want with boat strikes near Venezuela and Caribbean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has launched a large-scale military campaign called Operation Southern Spear since September 2025, conducting at least 21 airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific against vessels allegedly linked to drug trafficking, including ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear.\n\nTens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US.\n\nThey have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nPresident Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets.\n\nIn a statement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nIn at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nIt is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.\n\nBetween 2 September and 13 November, US forces hit at least 21 vessels in 20 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nCollectively, at least 80 people have been killed.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nOne investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nIn a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".\n\nBut some legal experts have said strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that  he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity .\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.\n\nIn October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\n\n\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"\n\nAs part of the operation, the US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nThis force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, as well as a range of guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nAdditionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that he authorised  the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.\n\nThis build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the left-wing socialist government of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nOn 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\nMaduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace.\n\n\"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv4dx05q5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:50:59.028+00:00","title":"Trump targets longtime MAGA ally Marjorie Taylor Greene","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a public backlash, President Donald Trump has withdrawn support from Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, accusing her of turning 'far left' and criticizing her for questioning his 'America First' agenda and handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

sometime next week.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.\n\nThe corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.\n\nThe BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation.\n\nAsked on Friday whether he still intended to go ahead with the legal action, Trump said: \"I think I have to do it... They've even admitted that they cheated.\"\n\nThe president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.\n\nA search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.\n\nIn a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"\n\nHe called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nIn July this year, US media company Paramount Global  agreed to pay $16m  (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.\n\nThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nMore than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nIn the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nControversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n\nIn its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\n\n\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.\n\nLawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\n\n\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.\n\nThey added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.\n\nFirst it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.\n\nWhen the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.\n\nSecondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.\n\nThirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.\n\nFourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.\n\nFinally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.\n\nThe BBC's apology came hours after a second  similarly edited clip , broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylw4pz83do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"01:06:21.855+00:00","title":"Should Hitler's DNA have been studied?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A groundbreaking DNA analysis of Adolf Hitler's blood, extracted from a 80-year-old fabric swatch taken from his bunker in 1945, has revealed that he had no Jewish ancestry and carried a genetic predisposition to conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

2025-11-15T01:06:21.855+00:00\n\nTitle: Should Hitler's DNA have been studied?\n\nGroundbreaking DNA analysis of Adolf Hitler's blood has uncovered some extraordinary findings about the dictator's ancestry and possible health conditions.\n\nPainstaking scientific testing by a team of international experts has been able to debunk a rumour on whether Hitler had Jewish ancestry (he didn't) and determine that he had a genetic disorder which affects the the development of sexual organs - all from an old blood-stained swatch of fabric.\n\nWhile clickbait headlines have focused on whether the Nazi dictator had a micropenis and only one testicle, more serious are the findings that his DNA showed \"very high\" scores - in the top 1% - for a predisposition to autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nDoes this mean he had these neurological conditions? Absolutely not, say the experts - it's not a diagnosis.\n\nBut nevertheless, concerns have been raised about stigmatisation and how ethical the research was, prompting the question - should it have been done at all?\n\n\"I agonised over it,\" says Prof Turi King within the first few minutes of Saturday's Channel 4 documentary on the research,  Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator .\n\nThe genetics expert told the BBC that when she was first approached to take part in the project several years ago, she was very aware of the potential implications on studying the DNA of someone like Adolf Hitler - \"I'm not interested in sensationalising things\".\n\nBut, she says, it was likely to be done by someone at some point, and at least under her watch she could ensure the research was done with academic rigour and with all the \"caveats and guardrails in place\".\n\nProf King is no stranger to high-profile and sensitive projects - she led the genetic investigation to establish  the identity of Richard III's skeleton  after it was discovered buried under a car park in Leicester in 2012.\n\nThe bloodied swatch of fabric - now 80 years old - was cut out of the sofa in Hitler's underground bunker, where he killed himself when Allied forces descended on Berlin at the end of World War Two.\n\nWhile inspecting the bunker, Colonel Roswell P Rosengren of the US army saw an opportunity to get a unique war trophy and he pocketed the fabric. It's now framed and on display at the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in the US.\n\nThe scientists are confident it really is Hitler's blood, because they were able to perfectly match the Y-chromosome with a DNA sample from a male relative that had been collected a decade prior.\n\nThe results, which are now under peer review, are indeed fascinating.\n\nIt is the first time Hitler's DNA has been identified, and over the course of four years, scientists were able to sequence it to see the genetic makeup of one of the world's most horrific tyrants.\n\nWhat is certain, experts say, is that Hitler did not have Jewish ancestry - a rumour that had been circulating since the 1920s.\n\nAnother key finding is that he had Kallmann syndrome, a genetic disorder that, among other things, can affect puberty and the development of sexual organs. In particular, it can lead to a micropenis and undescended testes - which, if you know the British war-time song, had been another rumour flying around about Hitler.\n\nKallmann syndrome can also affect the libido, which is particularly interesting, said historian and Potsdam University lecturer Dr Alex Kay, who is featured in the documentary.\n\n\"It tells us a lot about his private life - or more accurately, that he didn't have a private life,\" he explains.\n\nHistorians have long debated why Hitler was so completely devoted to politics, \"to the almost total exclusion of any kind of private life\", and this could help to explain that.\n\nThese kinds of findings, the experts say, are what make them both fascinating and useful. As Prof King puts it: \"the marrying of history and genetics\".\n\nMore complicated and controversial are the results suggesting Hitler may have had one or more neurodiverse or mental health conditions.\n\nLooking at his genome, and comparing it with polygenic scores, they found that Hitler had a high predisposition for autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nThis is where the science gets complex.\n\nPolygenic scoring combs through a person's DNA and calculates how likely they may be to develop a disease. It can be useful to detect an individual's predisposition to conditions like heart disease and common cancers. But it compares their DNA with a large population sample, and therefore the findings can be far less certain when it comes down to an individual.\n\nThroughout the documentary, which the BBC has seen, the experts are at pains to reiterate that the DNA analysis is not a diagnosis, but an indication of predisposition - it does not mean Hitler had any of these conditions.\n\nBut some genetic scientists have raised concerns that the findings are an oversimplification.\n\nDenise Syndercombe Court, professor of forensic genetics at Kings College London, feels they have \"gone too far in their assumptions\".\n\n\"In terms of character or behaviour, I'd have thought that's pretty useless,\" Prof Court, who tested the same blood sample in 2018, told the BBC.\n\nShe said she wouldn't want to make any predictions as to whether someone had a particular disease from the results, because of \"incomplete penetrants\".\n\nPut simply, by fellow genetic scientist Dr Sundhya Raman: \"Just because you have something encoded in your DNA, doesn't mean you'll express it.\"\n\nThis is reflected in the documentary by Prof Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University: \"Going from biology to behaviour is a big jump,\" he says.\n\n\"By looking at genetic results like this, there's a risk of stigma. People out there might think, 'Is my diagnosis being linked to somebody who did such monstrous things?'\"\n\n\"The risk is reductionism down to genetics,\" he says, when there are so many other factors to consider.\n\nThe UK's National Autistic Society was quick to respond, calling the findings a \"cheap stunt\".\n\n\"Even worse than the shoddy science, we're shocked at [the documentary's] callous disregard for autistic people's feelings,\" said Tim Nicholls, assistant director of research, in a strongly worded statement.\n\n\"Autistic people deserve better than this.\"\n\nThe BBC put the concerns to Channel 4 and Blink Films, the production company that made the documentary.\n\nIn a statement, it pointed out that experts like Prof Baron-Cohen \"explain that how someone behaves is a product of many factors, not just their genetics but also, very importantly, their environment, everything from childhood and life experiences, how they were brought up, access to education and resources and the cultural factors around them.\"\n\n\"The programme emphasises that the genetic insights revealed in the films shed light on Hitler, but they don't tell us he was biologically predestined to behave in a particular way.\"\n\nThere have also been raised eyebrows at the very name of the documentary, especially the second part:  Blueprint of a Dictator .\n\nProf King said it wasn't a name she would have chosen, and historian Prof Thomas Weber, who is featured in the programme, told the BBC he was surprised at the title, given they had stressed there is \"no dictator gene\".\n\nThe professor, who had not seen the documentary before speaking to the BBC, said he found the DNA analysis both exciting and concerning.\n\n\"Exciting, because it confirmed a lot of things I already suspected about Hitler... but I had concerns on whether people would read too much into genetics, like trying to find the 'evil gene'.\"\n\nHe was also concerned about how it would be received, especially for people with autism and other syndromes mentioned in the programme.\n\nThere are many difficulties and pitfalls when you're trying to make an accurate programme about complicated science for the general public.\n\n\"It's television - it occasionally gets simplified,\" said Prof King, who has a lot of experience balancing her responsibilities as a scientist with the realities of the media.\n\n\"They [the documentary makers] could have taken a different tact and gone very sensationalist but they haven't, they've tried to catch some of the nuance... and we've put in the guardrails.\"\n\nChannel 4 defended the show's name by saying that \"DNA is colloquially known as the 'blueprint of life'.\" Additionally, its job is to \"make programmes that reach a wide audience, and this programme aims to make complex scientific ideas and historical research accessible to all viewers\".\n\nThere are many questions on the ethics of the project.\n\nShould Hitler's DNA have been examined if his permission - or that of a direct descendent - could not be given?\n\nAnd how does that play into the fact that he was responsible for one of history's worst atrocities? Does that negate his right to privacy?\n\n\"This is Hitler - he's not some mystical character whom no one can conduct DNA research. Who makes that decision?\" Prof King argues.\n\nHistorian Subhadra Das agrees: \"This is what scientists do. There are hundreds of long-dead people who have had their DNA sampled, it's a common practice in science and archaeology – it's how we read into it that starts to become problematic.\"\n\nHistorian Dr Kay said he wasn't concerned about the ethical angle, \"as long as the facts were there and we made sure everything was double checked\".\n\nAnd on whether Hitler's DNA should have been touched: \"Hitler's been dead for 80 years. He doesn't have any direct descendents and he didn't have any children. He was responsible for untold suffering – we have to weigh that against the ethical dilemma of analysing his DNA.\"\n\nInterestingly, several labs in Europe declined being part of the project, and it was a facility in the US that did the testing.\n\nThe documentary-makers told the BBC that the research \"has gone through the standard ethical review process for academic work\" which includes reviews conducted in two countries.\n\nSo should this research have been conducted at all? The BBC spoke to a range of genetic scientists and historians, and the answer depends on who you ask.\n\nThose in the documentary, naturally, say yes. It helps to build a more rounded profile of Hitler, a person who still fascinates and terrifies in equal measure.\n\n\"We should do whatever we can to understand past extremism,\" Prof Weber believes.\n\n\"Let's be honest,\" says Dr Kay, \"these topics were already out there... we haven't suddenly planted this idea in people's minds. People have been speculating on whether Hitler had certain disorders for decades.\"\n\nNot all historians agree.\n\n\"I think it's a very dubious way of trying to explain what drove Hitler's actions,\" says Iva Vukusic, assistant professor of international history at Utrecht University.\n\nDr Vukusic, whose studies focus on the perpetration of mass violence, told the BBC she can understand why people are interested, but \"whatever answers we seek are not going to be found through a DNA test\".\n\nAnd while the research is interesting, it runs the risk of obscuring the real lessons of history, says historian Anne van Mourik.\n\nThat lesson is that \"normal people in certain contexts can commit, instigate or accept horrific violence\".\n\nFocusing on Hitler's (possible) micropenis, she says, doesn't teach us anything about how mass violence and genocide works and why it occurs.\n\nWith the study complete and the research under peer review, at some point, the full findings will be available.\n\nProf Weber says they should be used \"extremely carefully and soberly\", but he's hopeful that it is helpful in some way.\n\n\"That's the nice thing about research results – it might happen in five, 150, 500 years time. This research is there for posterity and I'm confident that smart people will use them in the future.\"\n\nBut we all have a responsibility on how we use these results.\n\nDr Kay says everyone must \"follow the science\" and make it clear on what we know and what we don't.\n\nThat includes the media and how it is reported.\n\n\"Anyone watching this documentary has a responsibility to write on it accurately, to make sure they're not contributing to the stigmatisation.\n\n\"A documentary like this doesn't exist in a vacuum.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:24:51.089+00:00","title":"Sudan conflict: Mass killings investigation gets green light from UN","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN human rights council has approved a unanimous, independent investigation into mass killings in El-Fasher, Sudan, following a two-year civil war that has killed over 150,000 and displaced 12 million.

light from UN\n\nThe UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher.\n\n\"Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,\" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday.\n\nSince the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes.\n\nThe new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher.\n\nThe findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court.\n\nWhile Türk did warn individuals and companies  \"fuelling and profiting\" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict.\n\nThe UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army.\n\nPlus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry.\n\nEl-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies.\n\nThe RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied.\n\nOne gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\"The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,\" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades.\n\nThe scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed.\n\nBack then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\"[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,\" she said.\n\nA joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\".\n\nIt follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations.\n\nThe US is one of the so-called \"Quad\" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule.\n\nRubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: \"We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved.\"\n\nThe UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by \"the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher\" and accused the Sudanese army of \"starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons\". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected.\n\nA furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called \"all biased statements against them\" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce.\n\nThe RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal.\n\nIn the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting.\n\nOnly a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth  are visible from space in satellite imagery .\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Türk said: \"There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action\" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war.\n\n\"It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.\"\n\nThe flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts.\n\nAmnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan.\n\nThe smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur -  according to a leaked report by UN experts .\n\nThe UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF \"isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it\".\n\nHe also said he did not want to \"diminish\" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying \"that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side\", meaning to the Sudanese army.\n\nAll parties deny these allegations.\n\nA fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities.\n\nIn response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\"\n\nThere has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Bateman\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3ydv2ygro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:24:18.224+00:00","title":"From florist to drone maker: How the weapon became so mainstream","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The war in Ukraine, beginning in February 2022, has catalyzed a global transformation in warfare, with military drones becoming a dominant and widespread tool.

world's \"first drone war\". It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine.\n\nBefore Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements.\n\nNow, she makes drones for use against the Russians.\n\n\"It was just an obvious decision for me,\" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. \"I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military.\"\n\nMs Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed.\n\n\"I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,\" she recalled. \"So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them.\"\n\nThese days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon.\n\nCombat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact.\n\nBefore 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones.\n\n\"This has been the first full-blown drone war,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare.\n\n\"There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians.\"\n\nAnd not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan.\n\n\"You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power.\" Ms Pettyjohn says.\n\nThe world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has  soared more than four-fold  since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due  to open a new factory  in Swindon in southwest England at the end of November.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be  spending £4.5bn  on new military drones.\n\n\"The sector is growing really quickly,\" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. \"I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon.\"\n\nThe growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down.\n\nAnti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport.\n\nOleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company.\n\n\"We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,\" he says.\n\nSince 2022, DroneShield's share price has  soared 15-fold.  \"We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,\" Mr Vornik adds.\n\nAs well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs.\n\nMunin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army.\n\n\"We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,\" he says. \"It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in.\"\n\nExperts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger.\n\nBut Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. \"That is going to be the next real shift.\n\n\"Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate.\"\n\nIn the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line.\n\n\"I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,\" she says. \"A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers.\n\n\"But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq83jqkpkn2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:17:23.871+00:00","title":"Walmart chief Doug McMillon retiring after more than a decade","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug McMillon, Walmart’s long-serving CEO, is retiring in January 2025 after more than a decade of leadership, during which he transformed the company by investing in digital capabilities, e-commerce, and supply chain modernization.

new tariffs and signs of slowing consumer spending.\n\nWalmart chairman Greg Penner said Mr McMillon had left the company in a stronger position than when he started in the role in 2014, when the rise of e-commerce had put the firm on the defensive.\n\n\"Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernising our

back tariffs on dozens of food products\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has  focused on the issue  since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.\n\nThe dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.\n\nThese goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.\n\nTrump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nHe has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead.\n\nBut grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an  investigation into the meat-packing industry , accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".\n\nHe has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering  $2,000 tariff rebate cheques  to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.\n\nBut the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".\n\nHe added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\"\n\n\"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.\n\nEconomists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.\n\nWhile inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed  price increases , with groceries up 2.7% from last year.\n\nThe Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.\n\nIn another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of  trade deals with four Latin American countries .\n\nThis week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.\n\nThe White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies.

chief strategist, was in the UK preparing for a speech at the Oxford Union.\n\nThe event was interrupted by hundreds of protesters and Bannon, who was due to board a flight that night, told Jeffrey Epstein in an email: \"Protesters slowed down speech don't think I can make the flight we r enroute to heathrow\".\n\nEpstein replied: \"There. Is a gulf air that leaves at 950 with a stop in Bahrain\". Bannon replied: \"U r an amazing assistant\".\n\nThe messages were published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier.\n\nThe release by the House oversight committee in Congress includes an iMessage chat in which Bannon's name is redacted. The BBC has been able to establish his identity by matching the dates, events and places mentioned.\n\nFor example, Epstein discusses chartering a plane from Scotland for the redacted user in the chat, and offers praise for their \"Oxford speech\". Bannon took part in the News Xchange conference in Edinburgh on 14 November, and gave the speech at the Oxford Union two days later.\n\nBannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not reply to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nBannon was one of Trump's closest advisers in the run up to the 2016 election and in the early days of his first administration, but resigned from the White House in August 2017.\n\nHe has acknowledged he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death and reportedly has around 15 hours of footage. In a live taping of his podcast earlier this year, he said: \"We're going to release the film, the five-part series, next year - early next year.\"\n\nBut the newly released documents suggest Bannon's relationship with Epstein went further than being his biographer, with the convicted paedophile occasionally seeming to act like a personal assistant.\n\nA few days before the exchange in which Epstein appeared to have arranged a charter jet for Bannon, Epstein said: \"how does it feel to have the most highly paid travel agent in history \".\n\nBannon thanked him: \"U r pretty good asst\", to which Epstein replied \"Massages. Not Included\".\n\nDiscussing a trip to \"AD\" in another message - presumably meaning Abu Dhabi - Epstein told Bannon: \"I'll make sure you're well looked after.\"\n\nThe released messages also show Bannon and Epstein discussing UK politics in 2018.\n\nEarlier on the same day he spoke at the Oxford Union, Bannon texted Epstein: \"I've gotten pulled into the Brexit thing this morning with Nigel, Boris and Rees Mogg.\"\n\nThen, in what appears to be a reference to Theresa May, the embattled UK prime minister at the time, he added: \"The guys are trying to move on. may today / tomorrow…\"\n\nEpstein advised Bannon: \"I think staying as long as you can uk . Best- so people get the commitment of your follow through.\"\n\nShortly after Epstein asked: \"Will Theresa may survive\". Bannon replied: \"I don't see how BUT the guys over here have no balls\" and added \"Boris ; Gove; Rees Mogg; David Davis - somebody has to step up\".\n\nTheresa May was eventually toppled in May 2019 after surviving two votes of no confidence in December 2018.\n\nA spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"Nigel Farage has never been in a meeting with Steve Bannon, Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson.\" And there is no evidence such a meeting took place.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote next week on whether the justice department should release all its files related to its investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.\n\nInterest in Epstein's relationships with powerful figures was renewed this week after the release of more than 20,000 pages of documents from his estate.\n\nSome of those mentioned Trump, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to deflect from questions about his relationship with Epstein.\n\nThe emails, released by the US House Oversight Committee, include many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 or the 2,324 email threads.\n\nRobert Garcia, the leading Democrat on the committee, said Trump was attempting to \"deflect from serious new questions we have about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\n\nIn addition to Clinton, Trump said he asked the Department of Justice (DoJ) to investigate banks JP Morgan and Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who is also a prominent Democratic donor.\n\n\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\n\n\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.\n\nA spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regrets \"any association\" they had with Epstein, and added that the firm \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump made a formal request or issued a directive to the justice department, or if Bondi was responding to his post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nBondi said she appointed US Attorney Jay Clayton to lead an investigation into the ties with Epstein.\n\nTrump's request comes ahead of the House of Representatives' vote next week on whether the justice department should release all its files related to the investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.\n\nDemocrat Adelita Grijalva's swearing in to the chamber on Wednesday triggered the move, after she immediately signed a discharge petition from calling for the release of the files.\n\nHer signature was the 218th - the final signing needed to trigger a floor vote. Four Republicans joined with Democrats to call for the vote.\n\nInterest in Epstein's relationships was renewed this week after US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from his estate, including many mentioning Trump.\n\nDocuments released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday appeared to show correspondence between Epstein and the former US Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers from October 2017.\n\nIn one email, Summers gives Epstein his opinion of Trump early in his presidency, writing: \"DJT is world s luckiest guy in terms of opposition, economy etc. still think his world will collapse\".\n\nA representative for Summers told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former treasury official and past president of Harvard University \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".\n\nThe documents also included email exchanges between Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nIn one email, sent in 2011, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. While he was discussed in some of the messages released this week, he did not send or receive them.\n\nTraditionally, presidents do not direct the justice department to investigate individuals and companies and have often brought in special counsels - independent attorneys from outside the administration - to carry out investigations.\n\nIt is also rare for an administration to seek an investigation of a predecessor. However, the Biden administration started investigations tied to allegations that Trump tried to interfere with the 2020 election, which were then referred to a special counsel. The cases were dropped when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Congress, Epstein survivors and the family of Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of his - called for US lawmakers to vote in favour of releasing the files.\n\n\"As you gather with your family this season, remember that your primary duty is to your constituents.

2025-11-15T00:14:49.822+00:00\n\nTitle: At 16, I was experimented on by the CIA and now I'm suing\n\nThe first thing Lana Ponting remembers about the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital in Montreal, Canada, is the smell - almost medicinal.\n\n\"I didn't like the look of the place. It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.\n\nThat hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.\n\nIt was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.\n\nAccording to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\n\n\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan.\n\nOnce there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent.\n\nOver 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.\n\nAt the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".\n\nDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\n\n\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.\n\nThe technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\n\n\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.\n\nMedical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous gas, a sedative known as \"laughing gas\".\n\n\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.\n\nThe harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.\n\nMs Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she says\n\nFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.\n\nShe says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed.\n\nMs Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan.\n\n\"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.\n\nShe says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares.\n\n\"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.\n\nThe Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability.\n\nFor Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\n\n\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"\n\nAlthough Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.\n\nBut regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.\n\nShe says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice.\n\n\"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d6w1glz3qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"23:49:17.275+00:00","title":"Pakistan's army chief gets more powers and lifelong immunity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan's parliament has passed the 27th constitutional amendment, granting Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir lifetime immunity, expanded powers, and authority over all branches of the armed forces, including the navy and air force.

2025-11-14T23:49:17.275+00:00\n\nTitle: Pakistan's army chief gets more powers and lifelong immunity\n\nPakistan's parliament has voted to give army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir new powers and lifetime immunity from arrest and prosecution, a move that critics say paves the way towards autocracy.\n\nThe 27th constitutional amendment, which was signed into law on Thursday, will also make significant changes to the way the country's top courts operate.\n\nThose defending the changes say they provide clarity and administrative structure to the armed forces, while helping to ease a backlog in the courts.\n\nPakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politics - sometimes seizing power in coups, and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes.\n\nThroughout its history, Pakistan has oscillated from more civilian autonomy to overt control under military leaders like General Pervez Musharraf and General Zia-ul-Haq. Analysts refer to the balance between civilian and military as hybrid rule.\n\nSome see the amendment as a sign that the balance is shifting in the military's favour.\n\n\"For me, this amendment is the latest indication, perhaps the strongest yet, that Pakistan is now experiencing not a hybrid system, but a post-hybrid system,\" says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington.\n\n\"We're essentially looking at a situation where the civil-military imbalance is about as imbalanced as it could possibly be.\"\n\nThe latest amendment means that Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee Pakistan's navy and air force.\n\nHis field marshal title and uniform are for life and he will be given \"responsibilities and duties\" even after retirement determined by the president with the advice of the prime minister.\n\nThe expectation is that this will give him a prominent role in public life for as long as he is alive.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued it clarifies Pakistan's military command structure.\n\nPakistan's government-operated news agency, the Associated Press of Pakistan, cited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the changes were part of a broader reform agenda to ensure Pakistan's defence keeps pace with modern warfare requirements.\n\nBut others see it as ceding power to the military.\n\n\"There is no balance between the military and the civilians,\" says Munizae Jahangir, journalist and co-chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\n\n\"They have tilted again that power dynamic towards the military and empowered the military at a time when the military needed to be reined in.\"\n\nThe second controversial area of change are the courts and judiciary.\n\nUnder the amendment a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) will be created which will determine constitutional questions. The FCC's first chief justice and the judges that serve in it will be appointed by the president.\n\n\"It forever changes the shape and the nature of the right to a fair trial,\" says Ms Jahangir.\n\n\"The influence of the executive has increased not just in appointing judges but also constitutional benches. When the state is dictating the constitution of those benches then what hope do I have as a litigant of getting a fair trial?\"\n\nArifa Noor, journalist and commentator, says: \"The judiciary is now quite subservient to the executive.\n\n\"The general consensus seems to be that the judiciary is now going to not really have any independent space to operate for the moment.\"\n\nBefore this amendment was passed, the Supreme Court would hear and decide on constitutional cases. Some said this created a backlog of criminal and civil cases waiting to be heard as judges had to listen to constitutional arguments as well,  arguing that separating the two has helped smooth the court process.\n\nThat has some traction with some lawyers, although Salahuddin Ahmed, a Karachi-based lawyer in the Supreme Court, sees that argument as disingenuous. He points out that the majority of cases pending in Pakistan are not in the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Statistically, if you were genuinely worried about making litigation quicker, you would focus on reforms for those cases.\"\n\nIn the hours after the amendment was signed into law, two Supreme Court justices handed in their resignations.\n\n\"The constitution that I swore an oath to uphold and defend is no more,\" said Justice Athar Minallah in his resignation letter.\n\nJustice Mansoor Ali Shah said that the judiciary had been brought under the control of the government and that the 27th amendment had \"torn the Supreme Court to pieces\".\n\nKhawaja Asif, the defence minister, said of the resignations \"their conscience has awakened because their monopoly on the Supreme Court has been curbed and Parliament has tried to prove the supremacy of the Constitution\".\n\nJudges can also now be transferred to different courts without their consent. If they don't agree to the transfer, judges can appeal to the judicial commission and if their reasons for not moving are found invalid the judge would have to retire.\n\nThose in favour argue that this will ensure that courts in all areas of the country can be staffed, but some are worried it will be used as a threat.\n\n\"To pick a judge up from the province where he's been serving and take him to a different high court is something that will place them under further pressure to toe the government's line,\" says Mr Ahmed. He worries that the change will upset the balance in Pakistan.\n\n\"[Our judiciary] has collaborated with dictators in the past, but they've also sometimes nudged the executive. I think if you completely rob people of that hope, then that sends them into other, much uglier directions.\"\n\nMr Kugelman agrees: \"Bottled-up grievances don't bode well for social stability.\"\n\n\"It does indicate a slide towards authoritarianism,\" says Ms Noor, adding that she sees the latest amendment as building on the 26th amendment, made last year, which gave lawmakers the power to pick Pakistan's top judge. There is already speculation of a 28th.\n\n\"It indicates that the balance of power is tilted in favour, heavily tilted in favour, of the establishment.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/politics/donald-korb-irs-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:23:27-05:00","title":"Trump Pulls Nominee for Top I.R.S.

'mystery' of planeload of Palestinians, Cyril Ramaphosa says\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the \"mysterious\" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country.\n\nThe group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they \"did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports\", local authorities said.\n\nMost were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.\n\nSouth Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.\n\nRamaphosa said the group \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site.\n\nIsraeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".\n\nA statement from the embassy said \"an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\".\n\nThe BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment.\n\nOf the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say.\n\nRamaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister.\n\nIn response, the president said \"we cannot turn them back\", according to News24.\n\n\"Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\"\n\nThe president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a \"proper evaluation\" of the matter and update the public on \"what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is\", according to public broadcaster SABC.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country.\n\nOnce it was established that the absence of this information \"did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum\" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry.\n\n\"All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,\" he said.\n\nSouth African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country.\n\nCivil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft.\n\nOne of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of \"peace, laws and justice\".\n\n\"We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,\" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children.\n\nGift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the \"humiliation they've caused\" the Palestinians.\n\nThe organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and \"using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking\".\n\nSouth Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\nThe country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nLarge pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.\n\nSmaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p5xn8qjpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:55:39.818+00:00","title":"Prashant Kishor: Why India's political start-ups rarely succeed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the failure of Prashant Kishor's political start-up, Jan Suraaj, in Bihar's 2025 elections, where despite massive media coverage, visibility, and a well-structured campaign, the party won no seats and failed to gain traction.

India's backstage magician -  the political  strategist trusted by everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to powerful regional leaders such as Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.\n\nBut when the 48-year-old finally stepped into the arena himself, the spell snapped.\n\nKishor launched Jan Suraaj (People's Good Governance) with the swagger of a data-driven political start-up and the promise of breaking the cycle of stagnation in Bihar, India's poorest state.\n\nHe spent two years walking across the state, built a slick organisation and fielded candidates in almost all 243 seats. The media buzz was huge, but Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat, scraping only a sliver of the vote, as  Modi's BJP-led alliance swept to power.\n\nFor all the attention Kishor commanded - often more than established leaders - the party could not convert visibility into votes. In India's febrile and deeply divided political marketplace, his debut, many believe, stands as a cautionary tale: breaking into the system is far harder than diagnosing its flaws from the outside.\n\nThe modern history of Indian politics bears this out.\n\nSince the rise of the regional Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1983, very few new parties have crossed the threshold of relevance. Those that have - from West Bengal's Trinamool Congress to Odisha's Biju Janata Dal - were breakaway factions of major parties, anchored in existing social bases.\n\nOthers, like Assam's Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in 1985 or Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party  (AAP) decades later, rode on the back of mass mobilisation and political crises. Kishor's Jan Suraaj had neither. It was not born of a street movement, nor did it emerge into a moment of anti-incumbent fury. Despite its many problems, Bihar in 2025 appeared to be largely content with the status quo.\n\n\"There was no anti-incumbency wave - voters largely stuck to established political and social loyalties. Without a visible crisis or widespread dissatisfaction, Kishor's party never appeared a credible alternative, despite hard work and mobilisation,\" says Rahul Verma, a political scientist.\n\nJan Suraaj's debut in Bihar also contrasted sharply with most new Indian parties.\n\nWhile parties like the AGP, TDP and AAP grew from \"socio-political movements that already had deep emotional and grassroots resonance\", and AAP was born from a mass anti-corruption movement, Jan Suraaj was conceived as \"more of an intellectual and strategic project\" - a strategy-driven initiative to fill what Kishor called a \"political vacuum\", says Saurabh Raj of the Delhi-based Indian School of Democracy.\n\n\"The subsequent padayatra [a long, grassroots walk across the state to meet people] tried to turn that intellectual idea into a people's campaign. But it still lacked the organic, movement-based energy that typically propels new parties to relevance. In that sense, Jan Suraaj feels more like a 'designed political start-up' than a party born of agitation or upheaval,\" adds Raj.\n\nKishor bet that this meticulously designed political project could substitute for a loyal constituency.\n\nHe talked of governance, jobs, forced migration for jobs and education - a compelling agenda in a state long trapped by caste and patronage politics. Reaching Bihar's 130 million mostly young people, Kishor brought hype, methods, charisma - and even memes.\n\nBut many believe his party lacked the combustible emotional energy that propels insurgent political outfits. Kishor's refusal to contest a seat himself may have deepened doubts about whether he was running an experiment or offering an alternative.\n\nThe Bihar verdict laid bare a structural truth of Indian politics: attention is not organisation, and media hype without ground strength can backfire.\n\nAs Raj notes, Jan Suraaj \"failed to become a serious contender on any seat\", and even its modest vote share \"shows the gap between visibility and strength\". The party has recognition but no natural social base - no caste, religious, gender or urban constituencies like its rivals, he says.\n\nVerma puts it more bluntly: start-ups fail more often than they succeed - in business and in politics.\n\n\"We tend to remember only the successes, but most new parties fail,\" he adds.\n\nBuilding a party requires visibility, organisation, mobilisation and the right candidates - each a separate challenge, especially without a track record of voters trust, says Verma. Jan Suraaj fielded candidates in all 243 seats, most of them first-timers.\n\nWhat does the failure of Kishor's high-profile Jan Suraaj tell us about Indian voters? Kishor drew crowds wherever he campaigned, was articulate and dominated media coverage - yet his party lost to a coalition led by 74-year-old veteran Nitish Kumar, whom he had bet would never return to power.\n\n\"Indian voters today are more politically aware and issue-sensitive than ever before, but they also remain deeply pragmatic. They often appreciate the freshness of a new agenda but tend to 'vote safe' unless convinced of a party's viability,\" says Raj.\n\nHe believes Jan Suraaj's focus on governance, jobs and migration was coherent and appealing, but without a charismatic electoral face, voters struggled to see it as a winning alternative.\n\nBy contrast, AAP's early success in Delhi hinged on anti-corruption campaigner Arvind Kejriwal personally contesting against Sheila Dikshit, the then chief minister of Delhi, a symbolic act that converted volunteers into voters.\n\n\"Kishor's decision to stay away from contesting limited that emotional connect and credibility. For new parties, a compelling agenda matters, but a relatable, risk taking leader who embodies that agenda is often the tipping point,\" says Raj.\n\nYet, this may not be the end for Kishor's party. In the past, he has promised to stay in Bihar and strengthen its grassroots presence and agenda if he lost the polls.\n\nRaj believes if Jan Suraaj can maintain a steady ground presence, cultivate local leadership and avoid the \"post-election dormancy\" that traps many new parties, it may gradually convert attention into influence.\n\n\"Bihar's political landscape is fluid, traditional caste loyalties are evolving and there is a growing appetite for credible alternatives. If Kishor chooses to lead from the front politically rather than strategically, and continues the grassroots engagement beyond the electoral cycle, Jan Suraaj could become a meaningful electoral force by 2030,\" he says.\n\nAs one local voter put it to a reporter in a village in Bihar: \"People might respond to [Kishor] in the next election. This time, he's just getting his feet wet - he's not some superhero who can soar immediately.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/politics/trump-epstein-inquiry-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:14:04-05:00","title":"Trump Demands Inquiry Into Epstein’s Ties to Prominent Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump announced a demand for a Justice Department investigation into high-profile Democrats, including Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, and Reid Hoffman, alleging ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe demand appeared to be a retaliatory move after Democrats released emails earlier this week that suggested Mr. Trump’s knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s sex trafficking operation was deeper than previously known.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Democrats released emails in which Mr. Epstein wrote that Mr. Trump had “spent hours at my house” with one of Mr. Epstein’s victims, and that Mr. Trump “knew about the girls,” many of whom were later found by investigators to have been underage.\n\nMr. Epstein also wrote in an email: “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop,” referring to his confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted of conspiring in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.\n\nIn response to the Democrats’ release, Republicans also made public a tranche of emails from Epstein’s estate in which Mr. Trump was mentioned several times.\n\nThe releases reignited a firestorm around Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Epstein that has roiled his supporters, who want the government to release to the public all evidence it has on Mr. Epstein’s crimes and relationships to high-profile officials.\n\nThe White House has maintained that Mr. Trump was not involved in Mr. Epstein’s operations, had cut off his friendship with Mr. Epstein in the mid-2000s — the two apparently had a falling out after Mr. Epstein attempted to steal a spa attendant from Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club —  and that the latest document releases were an attempt to smear him.\n\n“These emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday.\n\n“And what President Trump has always said is that he was from Palm Beach and so was Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein was a member at Mar-a-Lago until President Trump kicked him out because Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile and he was a creep.”\n\nGlenn Thrush contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lkjd2kmdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:00:42.059+00:00","title":"The 'bogan' Australian giving War & Peace an irreverent remake","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ander Louis, a Melbourne IT worker and part-time writer, has created a humorous, Australian slang-based translation of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel War & Peace, known as the 'bogan' version.

Andrei rocked up to Anna's joint. He was the pregnant sheila's hubby. Like his missus, he was pretty good looking himself.\"\n\nThose lines are straight from a new translation of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War & Peace, set in the world of Russian high society in the early 19th century.\n\nExcept this is a \"bogan\" version translated by Ander Louis, the pen name of a Melbourne IT worker who moonlights as a writer.\n\nHe's poured a metaphorical can of Australian beer over the novel by converting Tolstoy's prose into a lingo that wouldn't sound out of place in the popular Aussie sitcom Kath & Kim.\n\n\"It's how you'd tell it down the pub,\" Louis, whose real name is Andrew Tesoriero, told the BBC.\n\nThe 39-year-old started the project in 2018 as a joke, turning Russian princesses into \"sheilas\" and princes into \"drongos\", but is now on the cusp of signing a book deal.\n\n\"The number one reason I started doing it was to make me laugh, and I thought if it's making me laugh, maybe other people will too so let's put it out into the world.\"\n\nBogan, a term which first emerged in Australia in the 1980s, initially meant an \"unsophisticated and uncultured person\" with negative connotations, but not for Louis.\n\n\"I've never really thought of it as an insult, more a term of endearment,\" he says.\n\nAnd his version of the Russian literary masterpiece - which starts with the phrase \"bloody hell\" - is about being flippant and irreverent.\n\n\"It's just a good exclamation of surprise,\" Louis jokes.\n\nElsewhere, a noble is a fair dinkum, while the death of an important character is announced by \"he's cactus\".\n\n\"It changes the tone quite significantly,\" Louis laughs.\n\nFor years, Louis avoided picking up War & Peace, set during the Napoleonic wars of the early 1800s, given its heft.\n\nThe novel is divided into 15 books as well as an epilogue, which itself is split into two parts. With more than 1,200 pages to plough through, it's often regarded as the Everest of literature with prose as insurmountable as the famed peak.\n\nBut in 2016, Louis joined an online community where participants pledge to finish the book in a year by reading at least one chapter – there are 361 – every day.\n\nHe loved it so much, he did it twice.\n\n\"I became a bit of an accidental expert,\" he tells the BBC from Lilydale, on the outskirts of Melbourne.\n\nDuring this time, the part-time indie author was writing a novel with dark psychological themes so to lighten the mood, he started making War & Peace irreverent and funny.\n\nAnd for more than six years, Louis' project remained a little-known hobby he did in his spare time, self-publishing the first two translated books of War & Peace and selling a handful of copies.\n\nThat all changed earlier this year when a New York-based tech writer stumbled across the bogan version, posting excerpts from Louis' book in which he describes Napoleon as an \"alright bloke\", the high-ranking Prince Vasili as \"a pretty big deal\" and Princess Bolkónskaya as \"smoking hot\".\n\n\"Out of nowhere, it just went berserk. Overnight, I sold 50 copies,\" Louis says.\n\nThe father-of-two thinks the US interest in his bogan translation might be due to a \"Bluey effect\" given the popular Australian children's cartoon has been the most streamed show in the US for almost two years.\n\n\"Aussie-isms are in vogue over there at the moment\".\n\nAt first glance Tolstoy's book, filled with the lives of rich, powerful Russians, seems worlds apart from modern-day Australia.\n\nBut Louis argues bogan is the ultimate equaliser as the informal slang works across the social spectrum, whether it's in Australia or the world of Russian aristocrats.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of different types of bogan,\" Louis says.\n\nMark Gwynn, a senior researcher at the Australian National University, who helps compile the Australian National Dictionary, agrees. \"Bogans can be wealthy, poor, or in the middle so it's more about the way they behave, dress, socialise and talk,\" he says.\n\nHe says in more recent times, the term has also been used affectionately of someone considered a bogan or even in reference to oneself such as the term \"inner bogan\".\n\nAnd speaking \"bogan\" refers to casual speech with lots of local sayings, he says.\n\n\"Most Australians would know if you said 'speaks bogan' or 'bogan Australian' that the language would be highly informal with many slang and colloquial words and phrases, including uniquely Australian ones.\"\n\nBut there's no direct translation for the term in proper English – it's uniquely Australian.\n\n\"Bogans can live in [both] rural and urban areas so they don't equate to hillbillies, bumpkins, yokels, rustics,\" Gwynn says.\n\nNor are bogans the same as rednecks, as they can hold varied political views, while the British term \"chav\" – also typically used in a derogatory way to describe people from a poor background - doesn't apply either.\n\nThose shape-shifting bogan qualities along with Louis' varied resume - kitchen hand, energy analyst, Uber driver, punk rocker, Tokyo resident – makes him \"strangely qualified\" to create a bogan translation.\n\n\"When I'm drawing on voices, it's just quite genuinely from things I've seen and done… through all those different walks of life.\"\n\nCharacters in his bogan version say \"g'day\", friends are \"mates\" and those with questionable ethics are deemed \"shonky\".\n\nBeautiful ladies are \"chicky babes\", with one so beguiling she's \"hot as a tin roof in Alice\" – a nod to the extreme heat of Alice Springs' desert landscape.\n\nOne prince is an \"absolute true-blue legend\" whose vibrant eyes \"blazed like a bushfire\" while another is a \"bit of a yobbo\" who thinks others are \"carrying on like a pack of galahs\".\n\nWhile his version is peppered with plenty of profanity – which the BBC can't publish – part of the appeal is to make the book more accessible.\n\n\"The best feedback I've found is people saying how much easier it is to understand what's going on,\" he says.\n\nLouis likens himself to Pierre, the main protagonist in War & Peace, who represents the \"everyman\" as the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat who inherits a huge fortune, catapulting him into Russian high society.\n\nHe says he feels like he's the \"bumbling buffoon\" in the \"walled garden that is traditional publishing\" and that he's committed a kind of \"literary heist\".\n\n\"I've leaned over the fence… and just pinched the crown jewel - their most revered book - and taken it down the pub.\"\n\nAnd what would Tolstoy – who, though born a noble, later in life renounced his privileged upbringing and wealth – think of the bogan version?\n\n\"I actually think he would get a kick out it,\" Louis says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:31:11.412+00:00","title":"China and Japan in escalating spat over Taiwan: What to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The diplomatic spat between China and Japan over Taiwan escalated in late November 2025, triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion that Japan could activate its self-defence forces in response to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

A Chinese diplomat also made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi.\n\nThe spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about it:\n\nThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\n\n\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.\n\nA \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.\n\nTakaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".\n\nLast Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".\n\nWhile the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.\n\nTokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.\n\nXue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on.\n\nThen on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\".\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness.\n\nSun called Takaichi's remarks \"extremely wrong and dangerous\" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that \"otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan\".\n\nJapan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan \"has not changed\" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,\" he said during the daily news briefing.\n\nKihara also added that Japan \"strongly urged China to take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media comment.\n\nThen on Friday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan published a statement urging citizens \"to avoid traveling to Japan in the near future\" over what it called \"blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan\".\n\nThere is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.\n\nThis was referenced in a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday when it said that \"should Japan fail to draw lessons from history and dare to take reckless risks, even resorting to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses and pay a bitter price in the face of the iron wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\".\n\nHistorical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe ,  suggests more tensions may lie ahead.\n\nThe conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.\n\nTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan.\n\nShe had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.\n\nChina is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.\n\nOn the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nIn 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".\n\nIn this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\n\n\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\n\n\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/paul-kingsnorth-humanity-technology.html","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Government Announces New Economic Stimulus Package to Boost Growth and Sustainability","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government has unveiled a new economic stimulus package designed to revitalize consumer spending and support small businesses.

That some kind of apocalypse is all but inevitable — if it isn’t already upon us. That what’s needed now are strategies of resistance, endurance and escape.\n\nAnd he practices what he preaches, having retreated to the west of Ireland with his family — the better to keep them out of the clutches of what he calls the machine.\n\nBut he’s come back to us, for a time, bearing a prophetic message.\n\nPaul Kingsnorth is a novelist and a critic, an environmental activist and a convert to Eastern Orthodoxy. His new book is “Against the Machine: On the Unmaking of Humanity.”\n\nBelow is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nRoss Douthat: Paul Kingsnorth, welcome to “Interesting Times.”\n\nPaul Kingsnorth: Thank you very much. I think that’s a good thing, but I’m not sure.\n\nDouthat: We’ll find out. But we’re going to start with your life because you don’t just critique technological civilization; you have also at least somewhat withdrawn from it.\n\nYou’re here in New York City promoting this book, but once book promotion is done, you’ll return to Western Ireland, where you have lived for some time with your wife and children. Can you tell me about that?\n\nKingsnorth: I live on a few acres of land in a little house in County Galway in Ireland.\n\nYou can probably tell from my accent that I don’t come from Ireland. I come from England. I grew up in urban England. I worked there for a long time. I lived there for a long time. But both my wife and I were quite clear for a long time that we wanted to try and escape the machine, escape the rat race if we could. When you have children, it really focuses you on the shape of the world, the stories you want to tell them, the life you want to live. And we wanted to home-school our children. We wanted to teach them ourselves. We wanted to give them some time in nature. We wanted to take them away from the screens, which are enveloping absolutely every aspect of education and life for children.\n\nSo we jumped ship, left England, and we moved to rural Ireland as a kind of life experiment. We wanted to grow food, we wanted to try to be semi-self-sufficient, try to be rooted in a place.\n\nThat’s what we’ve been doing for about 12 years. And we’re still at it. It’s been pretty glorious, actually, considering that we jumped in with both feet to see what would happen.\n\nDouthat: How old are your kids now?\n\nKingsnorth: They’re 14 and 17 now.\n\nDouthat: So they were very young?\n\nKingsnorth: They were very young when we moved out there, 3 and 6, I think.\n\nDouthat: And so you’ve been home-schooling them and farming. Tell me about the farming.\n\nKingsnorth: It’s smallholding. It’s what you would call homesteading, I think, rather than farming. We have a vegetable garden; we have some orchards; we grow our own firewood.\n\nDouthat: Do you have electricity?\n\nKingsnorth: We do have electricity. I’d really like to go off-grid, but we haven’t managed to do that. Maybe in the future.\n\nDouthat: You mentioned getting away from screens, the tyranny, the omnipresence of screens. But you don’t just write books from your rural retreat; you also have a Substack. How do you navigate your own relationship to the internet? Is there like an internet hour?\n\nKingsnorth: It’s a constant battle. I actually have a little cabin out in our field that has an internet connection. So I can go out there and write and leave my computer there, then come back into the house and force myself away from it.\n\nI don’t do social media. I don’t have a smartphone. That’s not because I’m highly virtuous. It’s because I know that if I did, I’d be on it all the time like everyone else.\n\nDouthat: You would?\n\nKingsnorth: Because that’s how it works.\n\nDouthat: Yeah.\n\nKingsnorth: And we do it with our children. They’ve never had phones. They have laptops now for school. But there are hours when they can use them and hours when they can’t.\n\nI think it’s a good thing. It can sound like it’s very puritanical and restrictive and you’re forcing people not to do things. But it’s liberating, actually, in a way, very liberating for children. They have more freedom to actually be young people.\n\nDouthat: Is there a shock to coming back to civilization?\n\nYou’re on book tour through the United States. You’re here in Manhattan, near Times Square, the belly of the beast. Do you feel assaulted by the tech in the world?\n\nKingsnorth: I feel more and more assaulted. I lived in greater London till I was 11. I grew up in cities. I lived in Oxford, England, for a long time. It’s not as big as New York, but I’ve been in plenty of cities.\n\nIt’s not a shock to come to a city. It’s a bit of an assault on the senses when you live out in rural Ireland, certainly, but it is interesting how much more technological and screen-based everything is.\n\nI just drove through Times Square on the way here — and I have been there before — but just the sheer number of flashing lights, the sheer number of screens, huge billboards of virtually naked women, technology everywhere.\n\nDouthat: But also the reality that no one’s looking at these huge, flashing screens. Everyone’s walking through Times Square staring down at their phone.\n\nKingsnorth: To me, it always seems like a revolutionary situation because this has only been going on for 10 or 15 years. I think the iPhone was first sold in 2007. It’s not long ago at all. And we very, very quickly got into this situation where everyone’s staring down at the screen if they’re not surrounded by screens.\n\nIt takes a huge effort to stay out of it, and society makes it very difficult for you. Your work makes it very difficult for you. This is really what I’m talking about when I talk about the machine. It’s what I’m trying to write about in this book: There is a system that is surrounding us that is almost closing around us like a net.\n\nIf we actually step out of it for a minute and look at it from the outside, we’ve become utterly dependent on this web of technology that’s around us. It’s a radical situation — and it’s a very strange one — and it’s been normalized because it’s just happened so steadily. Yet, at the same time, almost everyone has a level of discomfort about it.\n\nDouthat: So let’s go a little further with definitions here. The machine is the iPhone, but it’s not just the iPhone. It is the internet, but it’s not just the internet. You said it’s a net that’s been closing around us for a long time. Give me a history of the machine.\n\nKingsnorth: So this phrase, the machine, is not my phrase.\n\nIt’s very deliberately lifted from greater writers of the past. It’s a word that writers from Mary Shelley onward for 200 years, at least since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution — poets, writers, artists, filmmakers — have been using to try and get some kind of grip on this system that’s been building around us since we first invented the steam engine.\n\nI think the technologies we’re talking about here — the phones and the screens and whatever else we’re using — are not so much the machine as a manifestation of it. The machine is a giant technological, economic, cultural system, which actually stems from a particular way of seeing. A peculiarly modern way of seeing, in which we move away from the relationship to culture that we had in the past, the relationship to nature, and especially the relationship to religion, the relationship to God. And we take the scientific revolution. We take the Enlightenment, we take the technological and the industrial revolutions, and they become almost a new theology. It’s really ultimately a war against nature, including human nature using technology.\n\nSo we’ve got to the point now where this thing that we might call the machine is closing around us to such a degree that we feel like cogs in it, but it’s very difficult to take us out of it.\n\nIt’s moving toward, very openly, a situation in which we are trying to conquer death, abolish disease, terraform new planets, recreate the whole of nature, create artificial food, replace our bodies with technology and effectively behave as if we were gods using technology to build a new world.\n\nDouthat: We will get to possible defenses of “the machine,” and I will offer arguments on behalf of the changes you’ve described.\n\nBut first I want to take up an idea that is sometimes implicit and sometimes explicit in your writing, and that is that this is a path to destruction. And it seems to me that there are two intertwined visions of that destruction in your book and in your arguments.\n\nOne is a vision essentially of a dehumanization and imprisonment of humans beings sort of trapped permanently in the machine and thus losing something essential about their humanity. And the second is a vision of ecological destruction. And I want to take those each in turn.\n\nYou’ve been a writer your whole life, but early on you were also an environmental activist. Can you talk a little bit about the relationship between the machine and nature?\n\nKingsnorth: Yeah. It was really a love of nature that took me into all of these inquiries in the first place. I used to go on long walks with my dad when I was young. Moving out of the suburbs and up into the mountains really gave me a sense of something that I hadn’t experienced before, and that drove me into environmental activism and environmental writing for a long time. And I think there’s something deeply unholy and sacrilegious and destructive about a culture that can ravage the natural world to the degree that we’re ravaging it now.\n\nI think that if you have managed to change the climate of an entire planet, if you’ve managed to destroy its forests, if you’ve managed to poison its oceans with plastic, if you’ve managed to kick off the sixth mass extinction — and that’s the situation we’re in, and if it’s this thing we call “the machine” that is doing that, this global economic industrial system is doing that, then you’ve got a major problem in your relationship with the natural world.\n\nDouthat: What do you make of the argument that the only way to avoid climate destruction are technological solutions? In the sense that there’s always been kind of a divide in the environmentalist movement between people offering the kind of thoroughgoing critique of modern civilization, like the one that you’re offering, and people who are saying our technology has created problems and we need to find technological fixes for those problems. That means electric cars. It means wind power. It means solar power and alternative forms of energy. And only out of that can you stave off the worst-case climate scenarios.\n\nKingsnorth: I’ve been writing and thinking about it for a long time. When the green movement began, it was very much focused on back-to-the-land solutions. Living a simple life and changing society so that it became much more simple and much less materialistic. That didn’t happen.\n\nVery clearly, the direction of travel is toward more machine all the time, and so the green movement has effectively now become a movement which promotes, at least in the mainstream, these technological solutions for perfectly rational reasons. We’re not going to stop climate change by all living simple lives on farms and by turning off the industrial machine. That’s clearly not happening.\n\nSo it makes logical sense to say: Great, we need wind farms and we need solar panels. And to some degree that’s a good idea. I mean, it’s a good idea to use wind farms and solar panels instead of burning coal, very clearly. If we’re going to have advanced technology, we need to make it as sustainable as possible. But we’re also getting to the point where the green movement is embracing things which I would regard as quite dehumanizing and unnatural.\n\nFor example: The replacement of farming with vat-grown food, which is becoming fashionable in some sorts of green tech quarters. And again, you come back to the question of: What are our limits here? Where do we actually stop?\n\nWhat do we mean by sustainability? Do we mean sustaining the progress of machine civilization? Just without producing carbon in a way that is not ecological? Or do we mean a society which actually is culturally and ecologically sustainable, where we can live human lives? Can we have a kind of green dehumanization, if you like? I think potentially you could.\n\nDouthat: It seems to me, and you can tell me if this is wrong, that there’s been a shift in your writing and emphasis over the years. You were sort of a pantheist Zen Buddhist; you practiced Wicca for a while and then you converted to Orthodox Christianity. And maybe tracking with that conversion, I feel like you still have a strong emphasis on the environment and ecology, but maybe there’s more emphasis on what happens to the human mind and the human soul under these technological conditions.\n\nKingsnorth: Yeah, I think that’s probably true. As you say, I’ve been on a kind of long and very winding spiritual search for about 15 years, which ultimately ended up in me becoming an Orthodox Christian. Which is something I wouldn’t have predicted a decade ago. But since arriving there, the pattern of everything makes a lot more sense.\n\nI think my concern for the destruction of the natural world, which was very profound for a long time, very intense, hasn’t disappeared, but somehow it’s subsided a little since I became a Christian.\n\nI think partly that’s because if you become a Christian, it isn’t possible to be a catastrophist in quite the same way. Because if you’re a Christian, you don’t believe everything ultimately is in the hands of humanity. There’s an end point to history. There’s something or someone who is bigger than us.\n\nWhereas if you have a more materialist worldview, if you have a more atheist or even agnostic worldview — and this is one of the things that drives the green movement — there’s a great sense of fear. Because you think: Oh, no, look at all this destruction we’re carrying out, and it’s all on us. Then we have to control it. We have to manage it. There’s nothing bigger than us. There’s no pattern to the history. If we don’t stop the climate changing, we’re all dead. If we don’t stop the forests falling, we’re all dead.\n\nThere can’t be any outside intervention in that way of thinking, if you like. There’s no bigger pattern. And because I do now see what I regard as a bigger pattern, it’s not that I don’t care about those things — I do — but as you say, I’m more concerned now with the dehumanization of us as people.\n\nAnd that’s also partly because of the rapid acceleration of technology and especially the rapid acceleration in the arrival of A.I., which is another quantum leap in the direction of the machine. And if A.I. systems are able to do even half of what their boosters say they’re going to be able to do in the next five years, then they’re going to make smartphones look like a bowl of cornflakes or something. It’s going to be a radical change. Even deeper alienation, not just from other people in the world around us, but from ourselves and from our understanding of what it even means to be a human.\n\nSo if this whole thing has been a war against nature, then the last part of the war against nature is the war against human nature. And I think that when we start to talk about creating artificial life, creating new intelligences, uploading our minds, all the stuff that comes out of Silicon Valley theology at the moment, that’s where we are. This is the war against human nature, which is presented as the next stage in progress.\n\nDouthat: So let me now try and make a case for modernity, just for a minute. Because you mentioned the Christian idea of directionality in history.\n\nFrom a Christian perspective, which is part of where the modern narrative of progress came from in the first place, we aren’t just stuck in endless cycles. We’re actually going somewhere. There’s a destination. And one reading of the last 200 years as a kind of counterpoint to your own would be to say basically, of course, modern technology is incredibly dangerous and has all kinds of downsides. And the story of modernity is a story of invention followed by constant battles to tame the machine and make it serve human beings rather than the other way around.\n\nOut of this struggle, you get atomic bombs and poison gas in World War I, but you also get vaccines, airplanes, whatever miracle of modern science someone happens to appreciate and favor.\n\nIn that case, this moment with the smartphone, the digital life, it’s just another moment, where of course the peril is great, but the point is to struggle to master the thing. Not to say the whole process was a mistake.\n\nWhat do you make of that part Kingsnorth, part Pangloss kind of take?\n\nKingsnorth: No, this is the argument, and to some degree it’s possible to look back on this. And you can look way back beyond the modern period in the West to the Roman Empire or to the civilization of pharaonic Egypt. And you can see these giant technological civilizations rising and falling.\n\nSo in that way, this thing called the machine is not just something that’s popped up in the last few hundred years here. It’s part of our human psyche in some way. Something that emerges in different places in history and rises and falls and disappears.\n\nIf you wanted to look at it from a Christian perspective, another way you could look at it is by opening the Bible and going to the first chapter of Genesis and seeing what happens in the garden when God tells us to exist, to tend and keep the creation he’s given us. And we choose instead to eat this fruit which gives us the knowledge of good and evil because the serpent tells us that if we do, we can be as gods and we choose to be as gods.\n\nAnd we then fall out of relationship with God and out of relationship with creation and into civilization. And the next thing you know, we’re building the Tower of Babel. We’re trying to build this great technological effort.\n\nDouthat: Cain built the first city.\n\nKingsnorth: Cain builds the first city. And before we know it, we’ve got the first global civilization building a tower to the stars and God has to scatter us.\n\nDouthat: And it ended badly.\n\nKingsnorth: And it doesn’t end well. So I mean, there are two ways of looking at it if you want to look at it from that perspective.\n\nDouthat: But in the same beginning of Genesis, God also tells people to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. And depending on your translation, subdue it. And so there’s some tension there where, yes, we ate the fruit of the tree, and that means that our building, our stewardship is not what it should be.\n\nBut it certainly doesn’t remove the impulse to build and create. It’s not clear that God just wanted us to live in the garden forever.\n\nKingsnorth: So what’s the obligation? That’s the question. Clearly, if you step back into a kind of secular way of looking at it, there’s no way of being human without technology or tools. As soon as we are human, we are building, we are making fires, even language, we’re creating complex language, which is a tool, we’re using sticks to dig holes in the ground. It’s technology and our ability to create it, which allows us to literally fill the earth there.\n\nThere are humans on every continent, including Antarctica. And so in that sense, our relationship to technology is not something that you can retreat from or go back from or hide from. The question is what does the technology serve? What are the tools doing? What should your relationship with nature and with God and with society and culture be?\n\nThe big question for me: Is there a point at which you can stop and say, actually, we’re not going to go any further in that direction. We’re not going to do that. Could we have stopped before the atomic bomb was developed and said: Actually, we know where that knowledge will lead us, so we won’t develop that thing?\n\nCould we stop now? This is a big crunch point. Huge numbers of people are warning against the further development of A.I. systems, including, most disturbingly, many of the people creating them. They’re the ones who are warning most loudly about where the systems will take us. Geoffrey Hinton, the British so-called godfather of A.I., in an interview, he thinks there’s probably a 20 percent chance that the development of A.I. will lead to total human extinction. So he’s the guy who created it. It’s not just weirdos like me on podcasts.\n\nDouthat: No, that perspective has been aired on this very podcast.\n\nKingsnorth: This is not unusual. So the people creating these things are saying: We have to stop doing it. So our question now, as human beings, is: Are we foresighted enough to be able to say: No, we’re not going to go that way. We’re going to go this way instead. I don’t know. Because so much of this is driven by profit and so much of it is just driven by the kind of telos of the people creating these things who seem to be taking us in a human direction.\n\nDouthat: But it’s also driven by some of the actual experiences of technological progress that people feel have been gifts for pretty obvious reasons, having to do with health, well-being and survival, before they get to the phase of welcoming the iPhone into their home.\n\nKingsnorth: I agree.\n\nDouthat: What is the healthy stage of our society or any society’s relationship to toolmaking, tech, invention? Is there a period in time where you would say, OK, that society is getting it right, that then slips away as the machine takes over?\n\nKingsnorth: That’s a very good question. The case I’m trying to make here is not that you point to a particular stage in the past and say, well, that was all wonderful, let’s go back there. And you’re right. It can’t be done anyway, so it doesn’t matter. But it’s also not the point, and there’s no doubt at all that, as you say, at the most basic level, there have been obviously great improvements in people’s lives, including in the house I live in, which would not have been the same place 100 years ago.\n\nThat is ultimately the question. Is there a point at which you can say things were working here and we shouldn’t have gone any further?\n\nDouthat: Not even that you shouldn’t have gone any further, but a cultural mode where you say this society is inventing things and relating to them in a way that is good, where you can trust them with the power of invention. At one point you cite Oswald Spengler, the great doom-ridden German philosopher of the 1910s and 1920s, and he has sa vision of history where societies have healthy cultures that give way to decadent, machinelike civilizations, and then fall and the cycle starts again. What was the healthy culture of the Western world?\n\nKingsnorth: So here’s the thing. Everything’s an exchange. There is no point at which you have a healthy culture that does not have negatives to it.\n\nThe question maybe is what the exchange is. So today we have, if we’re lucky enough to be middle-class people in the Western world and not people in Africa digging up the cobalt for the phones we’re having to use every day, which is always worth emphasizing. All of this stuff comes with a huge cost, not just an environmental cost. Much of the stuff we’re actually buying in a city is literally manufactured by slaves in factories somewhere in the east or in Africa, who we don’t have to see.\n\nThere’s always an exchange. So we have a certain level of comfort, which most of us don’t want to give up, but there’s a price to pay for that. The same thing would be true of, I don’t know, living in a situation 100 years ago where people were living more simply, perhaps living, living a materially poorer existence.\n\nThe exchange they would be making is in some cases, at least, they would have a stronger community. They would have a closer relationship to nature. They would have a clearer religion, they would have a simpler life, but the exchange they would be making is they would be less materially rich. Let me answer it the way I try to answer it in the book —\n\nDouthat: [Laughs.] It’s OK to say the high Middle Ages got some things right without saying we want to go back to the 13th century and so on, but it’s OK to say it.\n\nKingsnorth: If we’re talking about the West, if I were to look at, say, England, I would be looking at premodern England and I would say, OK, in premodern England to a great degree, despite all the general problems that you have in people’s everyday lives, you have a situation in which people have a strong religious organization, they have a source of meaning.\n\nThey’re a Christian society, they have a sense of direction, they have real communities and they have a sense of who they are and they have a relationship to nature. So, again, as I say in the book, I try to define what actually makes a real culture and I come up with this formulation that I call the four P’s, which are people, place, prayer and the past.\n\nI think those are the four legs on which the stool of a real culture is built on. So you have people, that’s your community. You have place, that’s the place you live in, the place you come from, the relationship you have to the natural world. Then you have prayer, that’s your relationship with God, and you have the past, which is where you and your stories come from, which you want to pass on to your children.\n\nIf I were to look at England I would say, even before the Industrial Revolution, all those things were virtually intact, despite all the various problems you might have in your everyday life. In the book, I try to identify where the machine begins. I look at the way that people’s land was taken away from them. They were forced into the cities. Capitalism begins to develop.\n\nDouthat: This is … 1600s?\n\nKingsnorth: This is really from the 1500s to 1600s onward. By the 1900s it’s very well developed and the English ruling class can then take that model out into the world, out into the colonies and impose it on everyone else.\n\nSo you enclose people’s land, you enclose their lives, you make them powerless. So anytime before that is a time which, despite all the problems you have, and we all know about them, you have a sense of living in a real culture in a real place. It’s interesting, if I talk to my elderly neighbors in Ireland about what life used to be like there, they’ll readily concede that it was poorer and they like not being so poor. But also, almost instantly, they will talk about the complete collapse of community in the place that they live in. The fact that they knew all the neighbors and now they don’t know anybody.\n\nNobody goes visiting anyone’s houses anymore. The abundance of nature has been destroyed by mechanized farming. The folk traditions have gone. Nobody goes to the church anymore. So on the one hand say, well, look, they’re warmer and better off than they were before, and they’ve got a wider variety of food, but they’ve lost a huge number of the things that actually make being human meaningful.\n\nI think it’s very easy to look at that and say, well, that’s just romanticizing the past because the things that make human life meaningful are not as easily measured.\n\nWe can have statistics on poverty relief, and we can have statistics on how much economic growth has been and how much more G.D.P. we have and how we’ve all got a house full of televisions and iPhones and cars that we didn’t have 50 years ago, and therefore we’re wealthier. But culturally and spiritually, we’re not wealthier. In most cases, there’s been a huge decline, so that’s the exchange.\n\nDouthat: I guess I’m interested in that idea of exchange, an idea of balance. I think about this in terms of America, because obviously America,  we were born in the machine in some ways. The period you’re describing is the period when America began. We’ve always been a technological republic. There’s no medieval past for Americans to look back on. We have to live in a world where we’re trying to find balance. Right?\n\nKingsnorth: Does America want balance, though? [Laughs.] Does America always move forward? I think America always moves forward. It’s a modern society. It’s an enlightenment culture. To go back to Spengler or someone like the British historian Arnold Toynbee who’s writing at a similar period in time, they posit this cyclical nature of civilizations. There’s always a rise and fall.\n\nI’m quite convinced by that model. I think that’s whether or not it has a mathematical basis, that’s what societies tend to do. So I’m not sure that humans are actually capable of getting to the point where they say: OK, we’ve got a good balance here.\n\nCan you have a balance of a really rooted culture with a relationship to nature and God that also has iPhones in his pocket? That’s the question.\n\nDouthat: That is the concrete question right now. The general question, though, is if you accept a cyclical story and you wake up and you realize: Not only am I in the middle of my life, but I’m in the middle of the phase in civilizational history when things are going bad.\n\nIs it just all over? Are you just sitting around waiting for the fall? Or can you — this is something I think about a lot. The United States of America, we are a capitalist liberal society. We’re also a society that has its own internal arcs of religiosity. We have great awakenings, we have revivals, we have fall secularization, then we get another revival and so on. Can you look at 21st-century America and say: We seem to be in this decadent phase, but maybe we can have religious revival, or if you’re not religious, civic revival? Can we avoid the collapse?\n\nKingsnorth: Well, I actually think those two things are quite closely related. So I’m a member of the Orthodox Church. I know a lot of Orthodox people in America. I’ve just been to a monastery in upstate New York. There’s a huge revival in an interest in Orthodox Christianity here, especially among young men. Interestingly, huge numbers of young men coming into the church. Same is true in parts of the Catholic Church. Same is true where I live in Ireland. And in England, there’s a very clear evidence of a very significant uptick — in Christianity, which would never have been predicted five or six years ago.\n\nI mean, Christianity in particular is a religion which actually flourishes best when things are collapsing. In my opinion, I think Christianity does worse when it is powerful and comfortable. It’s a society, it’s a religion which grew out of a collapse. The early Christians had to live through the collapse of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Irish monks and the monks in other parts of places like England, who kept the Christian faith going and kept the books hidden and took them out into the culture after the barbarian invasions, they built Christendom. Christianity works and comes and flourishes at a time of collapse.\n\nA lot of people find the kind of stuff I talk about extremely depressing. I don’t find it depressing. I find it in some ways quite exciting because everyone might have a different analysis of where we are.\n\nTalk to a guy in Silicon Valley; he’ll say everything’s terrific. The singularity’s coming. We’re moving in the right direction. Talk to a doomer like me; I think we’re dehumanizing ourselves and destroying the natural world, but to me, a realization of the fact that we’re in a revolutionary moment gives us a chance to actually say, well, what’s actually true? What’s real?\n\nWhat do we actually want to do? How do we want to build societies? What do we want to do in our own lives? What relationship do we want to have with technology? Should I be going back to church? What do I want to teach my children? It’s at times when things seem to be collapsing or crumbling, when all the new shoots come up, which actually is also another story of America, I think, that happens repeatedly. Things seem to be falling apart and then something grows again. That’s certainly the story of the Christian Church over the last 2,000 years.\n\nDouthat: I completely agree with that. I do wonder, though, in the traditional cycles of the civilization story, what brings things down in the end is barbarian invasion. But in your storytelling about the internet, you use the phrase Faustian to describe the bargain that our civilization has made. Well, Faust, you know, he gets everything he wants, and then he gives up his soul and goes to hell. So let’s just be supernaturalist for a minute. The internet is not the Huns. It’s not the Mongols. But is it the devil?\n\nKingsnorth: Sometimes I think the internet is a giant Ouija board and we use it to summon things. And things appear through it. So if you want to be supernaturalist about it, if you want to be Christian about it, the world is inhabited by powers and principalities and demonic forces, which have it in for us, and which want to turn us away from God. That’s their purpose. I think if C.S. Lewis was writing “The Screwtape Letters” today, there would be a good few letters about how the demons can use the internet, how they can use the phones, how they can use this to completely delude us and distract us and take us away from our true purpose.\n\nThere’s a couple of chapters in the book in which I speculate quite openly about this, and I’ve done it in other parts of my writing, especially in fiction as well, because I think there’s something very spiritually dark about the internet, actually. Just on a practical level, we see chatbots persuading teenagers to kill themselves. We have all sorts of dark, horrible stuff going on. But there’s something about the very deliberate drive to ask our Silicon Valley overlords, say, to create God, to make God. I mean, the book is full of quotes from these people about what they’re doing, and it’s openly theological.\n\nWe’re creating God, we’re building God, we’re replacing God. We’re creating machines that will have a spirituality to them. That’s where we’re going. So we have a sense that what we’re doing with the internet is not simply using a bunch of ones and zeros to give us a load of stuff we want, but actually creating a new religion, a new spiritual worldview in which we are going to upload our minds. We are going to live forever.\n\nAnd in the process of trying to create an artificial intelligence, the question that haunts me is: Are we creating these things or are we summoning them?\n\nIs it possible that the machines we’ve made are actually being inhabited by something else? Is this just a mess we’ve made with our technology? Or is there something that’s actually working on our minds through it, which occasionally can keep you up at night.\n\nDouthat: We had Peter Thiel on this podcast — entrepreneur, technologist, religious believer of a distinctive kind — and we talked about the Antichrist. Thiel’s argument is that the Antichrist is likely to deliver peace and safety and promise to freeze everything in place and just protect people. The Antichrist would be, in the end, an enemy of technological progress.\n\nI think it’s safe to say that you have roughly the opposite perspective, and that what you are describing is the Antichrist coming in the form of a technological solution to all of human nature?\n\nKingsnorth: I think Peter Thiel’s trying to get us to look in the wrong direction — probably quite deliberately. Peter Thiel only came out a few days ago and said that he thought that regulating A.I. would lead to the rise of Antichrist precisely for that reason.\n\nIs Antichrist going to be a person or is Antichrist going to be a machine? Is Antichrist going to be a being that we create or that comes through the things that we have created?\n\nI think people like Peter Thiel are involved in building something which is becoming quite openly evil — destructive of human flourishing, destructive of nature, destructive of our relationships, destructive in all the ways that we’ve talked about.\n\nI think it’s fascinating that these billionaires who are involved in creating weapons systems and surveillance technology are also talking from a Christian perspective. I find that utterly bizarre.\n\nThe constant progress of the technological system at the moment — the direction it’s going in — is going to lead to the rise of beings which are very Antichrist-like in their functioning. The promise of Antichrist in the Christian story is that he — or it — is a great prophet, which imitates Christ. Every religious believer thinks this is the new prophet who has come to unite a world which is crumbling.\n\nThat’s the promise that technology’s giving us at the moment. That’s the promise that we are being openly given by the people who are creating these great superhuman intelligences, these great beyond-human minds that they’re trying to build. These things are going to bring us together. These things are going to solve our problem. These things will be rational. These things will overcome our human passions and our destruction. These things will unite us.\n\nIt’s almost as if the technological system is coalescing — the Silicon Valley people talk openly about this — toward the creation of a being, which is seen to be and is promised to be our salvation. And when they start to talk about uploading their minds into the silicon substrate, you’ve effectively got a digital Christian heresy going on.\n\nYou’ve got Christianity without Christ: We create heaven. We create a place in which we can live eternal lives, and we ultimately create beings which we regard as gods.\n\nDouthat: Some of the people in Silicon Valley — Thiel included — have for a long time complained that technological progress has focused so exclusively on the digital, on the virtual.\n\nThiel’s famous line was we were promised flying cars and we got Twitter. And obviously, Elon Musk wants to build rockets to get into space. Jeff Bezos wants to do the same thing.\n\nI see a distinction between technological impulses. I think that building rockets to go into space is OK. Not only is it OK, it might even be good. It might be the human destiny. Whereas I completely agree with everything you are saying about the ambition of uploading our minds to the cloud.\n\nI want to root for certain kinds of technological progress and against others. But am I not allowed to do that? If I like Elon Musk’s rockets, am I hastening the uploading of my consciousness into some kind of hell, effectively?\n\nKingsnorth: Well, that’s a good question, isn’t it? I’m not with you on the rockets. I think we should stay here ——\n\nDouthat: Yeah, you’re very anti-space.\n\nKingsnorth: We should stay here because there’s something about boys with toys here. There’s something about these guys — isn’t it so cool? We can go into space. We’re going to terraform Mars, we’re going to mine the asteroids. But they haven’t changed the mind-set that’s actually been so destructive here.\n\nSo what are we going to do? We’re going to go and terraform Mars. We’re going to live there. Create a new planet to live on because we’ve wrecked this one, and I’m sure we’re not going to end up doing exactly the same thing.\n\nInstead of going on an outer journey all the time — which is what our culture’s so good at — maybe we should try and go on an inner journey. Because the thing that we have utterly destroyed in Western culture — including much of Western Christianity, which is one of the reasons I’m an Orthodox Christian — is the contemplative life, the inner search, the inner journey. And usually those two things balance out.\n\nAnd I was thinking only yesterday, actually, about this: that maybe a society which can balance its outer exploration with its inner exploration could be a more healthy one. We’ve effectively abolished inner exploration — except in a very New Agey, very individualistic way where we define our own reality.\n\nI think that’s the same impulse that leads someone like Elon Musk to want to put a chip in your brain. So he doesn’t want to go to Mars, but he also wants to put a chip in your brain ——\n\nDouthat: Yes, he does.\n\nKingsnorth: And it leads someone like Peter Thiel to create Palantir, which can survey all of human life from a very low level and then hand that information all over to the military. It’s the same impulse.\n\nAre we trying to live a life that serves God and serves the creation of God and serves human flourishing on that basis? Or are we trying to serve ourselves and our own desire to explore and create and get rich?\n\nDouthat: Sure, but part of our desire to explore and create is God-given and good.\n\nKingsnorth: Maybe. What’s God-given and good? I mean, everything’s God-given, but is it all good? No. So then you have to distinguish between the good God-given things and the bad ones.\n\nDouthat: Elon Musk converts to Orthodox Christianity, disappears into a monastery for 10 years, re-emerges ——\n\nKingsnorth: I thought that was a new story for a minute. [Laughs.]\n\nDouthat: At the moment, I would say Musk is interested in affiliating himself with Christianity on X, which is some degree short of actual conversion.\n\nPut yourself in God’s perspective for a moment, hubristically. Is there a world where human beings could be worthy of going to space? Maybe God won’t let us succeed until we have a kind of cultural conversion.\n\nKingsnorth: Well, the question is what Musk wants to do when he comes out of the monastery. He’s not going to want to do the same thing, is he?\n\nDouthat: I don’t expect you’ll trust it if he comes out of the monastery and says: We’re still going to Mars ——\n\nKingsnorth: I was right about everything. [Laughs.]\n\nLook, I don’t know the answer to that. Who knows what God’s purpose is for us? But I see something intensely sacrilegious and self-centered and anti-nature and anti-culture in the direction that we’re going in at the moment. We’re a society which believes all limits exist to be broken — culturally, socially, ecologically, technologically.\n\nIf we see a limit, we just break it. We don’t have any sense that there is anything that holds us together. If we don’t rediscover that, then it’s going to be boys with toys all the way down. And some of the toys the boys will build might be fun and useful, and many of them will be massively destructive.\n\nI think that because we have the same rootless, limitless vision of progress, those two things go together. That’s the way I see it at the moment.\n\nDouthat: But maybe you trust the culture of the high Middle Ages with vaccines and rocket ships — or maybe just the vaccines.\n\nKingsnorth: That’s kind of like a steampunk novel that maybe I need to write next.\n\nDouthat: Let’s end with a novel that you have written called “Alexandria,” which came out in 2020.\n\nKingsnorth: Yes, right in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nDouthat: I’ve been sort of pushing you to define the apocalypse.\n\nThat’s a novel about an apocalypse. It’s set around the year 3000 A.D., a thousand years in the future. And it’s a world where both strands of your dark vision have come to pass.\n\nThere’s been ecological catastrophe of some kind. And, in part to escape the ecological catastrophe, human beings have made a deal with an A.I. mind that they think they’ve created, but maybe they’ve summoned. And everybody’s uploaded their minds to this virtual city called Alexandria that may or may not be paradise. Except there’s a really small number of people who have chosen not to and who live a deeply premodern existence on the fringes of what used to be the British Isles. And the story is mostly about them.\n\nI found this book very depressing. But not only because I found that choice depressing. I want to stipulate for the record: I will never upload my mind to the cloud; I will refuse Alexandria no matter what terms are offered. But I’m not going to live a premodern life.\n\nThe premodern life depicted in the book is authentically premodern, and therefore, to my mind, deeply unattractive and indeed terrifying. There are billions and billions of people on planet Earth living in the machine as you describe it.\n\nEight billion people are not going to move to County Galway, and if they did, it would be terrible. So what do they do?\n\nKingsnorth: Absolutely. Don’t do that. One of the poems I start the book with is by Robinson Jeffers, great Californian poet.\n\nDouthat: Very dark poet, I have to say. Very dark poet. Not an optimist.\n\nKingsnorth: Not an optimist, but he has this poem about a purse seine fishing net closing around a group of fish that he’s watching from a cliff in California.\n\nAnd he sees that as a kind of story for where we are in the culture. What I’m trying to do with “Alexandria” is to play out this debate and take it to its extremes and say: What would actually happen if you had this choice? And what would be the upsides and the downsides, the dark sides and the light sides of both of those choices?\n\nI’m trying to play out a debate there. As you say, most of the world is living in cities now. We’re all in the technological system. Even if we live out in County Galway, we’re still on the internet. That’s how it works.\n\nDouthat: Sometimes they even make you go on book tour.\n\nKingsnorth: Sometimes they even make you go on book tours, on planes.\n\nThere’s no way of escaping it. I know people who live in off-grid cabins with no running water and no electricity. They still haven’t escaped the machine. They still have to have a bank account.\n\nSo asking yourself if you can step outside the system is almost the wrong question. The question is what relationship you can have with it and where you can draw your lines. What do you want to do with technology, and what do you want it to do with you?\n\nI think if you don’t define your relationship with the machine, it defines it for you. And that’s true of all of us. We can be different degrees inside and outside the system, maybe, depending on where we are. There are levels of relationship, but it’s a time when we’re all caught up in this thing. It’s been building up for a long time.\n\nI don’t know where it’s going, but I do know that it’s worth asking who our technology serves and what relationship we want to have with the system. Then at least we’ve got some kind of chance of living a human life at a time when I think there’s going to be more pressure on the simple reality of actually being human than there’s ever been before.\n\nDouthat: On that theme, the last question is similar to one I actually asked Peter Thiel. In the end, God will not abandon us to the machine, right?\n\nKingsnorth: Without wanting to spoil the end of the book, the end of the book is not depressing. Not to me. The end of the book is actually very much the opposite of depressing. Something quite transcendent happens.\n\nIf you’re a Christian, you know what happens at the end, anyway. Christ has already overcome the world, so we have to be of good cheer throughout the age of the machine.\n\nMy favorite line in the whole Bible: “Be of good cheer for I’ve overcome the world.”\n\nSo what we have to do as we live in this world at this particular time of challenge — and history has given Christians and others plenty of times of challenge and horror and difficulty — is try to live our faith through it and try to remain human through it.\n\nOne of the many differences, I’m sure, between me and Peter Thiel is we probably have a very different idea of what it means to be human and what God actually means by that. And what our relationship to nature and culture should be.\n\nWe’re living in a time in which our traditional notions of humanity have been challenged more than ever. That’s very difficult, but it’s also an opportunity to actually look at what we think is true, what we think is good, what we think is real, what we think it means to be human, what we think a good human society looks like.\n\nIn the end, if you’re a Christian, you know what the end of the story is. But in the meantime, I think that standing up against this progressive, spiritual dehumanization — which is what technology is giving us at the moment — is quite imperative.\n\nYou’ve got your lines, you’re not going to upload your mind.\n\nDouthat: I’m pretty committed.\n\nKingsnorth: I think that’s good. This is the place we’re going to be at in a few years if we’re not there already: asking ourselves what our lines are and what we are as human beings. And that gives us an opportunity to ask ourselves what it actually means to be human. Which is maybe a question we’ve never been asked before in this context, but we have to ask it now.\n\nDouthat: Paul Kingsnorth, thanks for joining me.\n\nKingsnorth: Thank you.\n\nThoughts?

2025-11-14T14:25:58-05:00\n\nThe president of the Boston University College Republicans has been attacked online for saying on social media that he had called immigration agents before a raid at a Boston carwash in which nine workers were detained.\n\nZac Segal, a Boston University junior and a track athlete, according to his school bio page, posted on social media on Nov. 7 that he had “been calling ICE for months” about workers at Allston Car Wash, near the Boston University campus in the Allston neighborhood. Federal agents swarmed the business on Nov. 4, detaining five women and four men who worked there, according to their lawyer, Todd Pomerleau. The workers are contesting their detentions in court, he said.\n\nMr. Segal’s post about the carwash included a link to an article about the raid. He wrote that immigration agents “finally responded to my request to detain these criminals. As someone who lives in the neighborhood, I’ve seen how American jobs are being given away to those with no right to be here. Pump up the numbers!”\n\nHundreds of people have attacked Mr. Segal online for his post. On the Instagram page of the B.U. College Republicans, one person wrote that “Zac Segal should be deported!” Another suggested more ominously, “Zac Segal should be afraid.” Mr. Segal also received messages of support on the social media platform X, such as “Patriot!” and “Thank you Zac.”\n\nMr. Segal did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. On Thursday, he reposted, without comment, messages calling him “racist and fascist” and labeling him a “neo-nazi.”\n\nHe also posted a screenshot of a Boston Globe article about his efforts to report the carwash workers to ICE, writing, “We must stand up for this country.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains a tip line and encourages citizens to report “suspicious activity” by phone or online.\n\nThe College Republicans of America, the national group with which B.U. College Republicans is affiliated, defended Mr. Segal for doing what the government had asked of him. “We call on all College Republicans to follow in the lead of this great patriot and notify their local ICE forces of any suspected illegal activity in their communities immediately,” Martin Bertao, the national group’s president, said in a statement.\n\nThe B.U. Republicans announced its affiliation with the College Republicans of America this week, after it broke away from another group, the College Republican National Committee, over concerns about its direction and allegations of misconduct.\n\nIt is not clear that Mr. Segal actually had anything to do with causing the Nov. 4 immigration raid in Allston. The Trump administration on Friday denied that Mr. Segal had brought agents to the carwash.\n\n“The operation was highly targeted and relied on law enforcement intelligence — not your silly rumor,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in an email.\n\nMr. Segal’s school bio says he is an economics major from London.\n\nThe attorney for the workers, Mr. Pomerleau, said they had been busy vacuuming cars when “military style” vehicles pulled up to the carwash. Masked agents who he said were clearly armed began making arrests. Those detained included a brother and sister and a pair of sisters. Another person is 67 and has lived in the United States for some 30 years, Mr. Pomerleau said.\n\nIn referring to the detained workers as “criminals” in his post, Mr. Segal “is spreading false information about nine people he doesn’t know,” Mr. Pomerleau said. “These people are not criminals.”\n\nHe expects bond hearings to begin soon. “All of them at a minimum are going to get due process under the law.”\n\nMr. Pomerleau said he has received an outpouring of support for the detained workers.\n\nBoston University did not immediately respond to messages on Friday.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykze63r2xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:01:26.372+00:00","title":"Record settler attacks in West Bank opening up rifts within Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record levels of settler violence in the West Bank, especially during the annual olive harvest, have escalated since the 2023 Gaza War, with over 260 attacks recorded in October 2025 alone.

Hamida Mosque, near Deir Istiya in the occupied West Bank, are still scattered on the ground outside.\n\nCharred furniture, lecterns and smoky curls of carpet are piled around the entrance - its guts emptied, and debris cleared, in time for Friday prayers.\n\nDozens of men arrived for the prayers in a show of defiance - their backs turned towards the scorched and blackened wall.\n\nThe imam here, Ahmad Salman, told the BBC the attack on Thursday was a message from Jewish settlers, amid a wave of settler violence across the West Bank.\n\n\"The message they want to send is that they can reach anywhere - into cities, into villages, that they can kill civilians and burn houses and mosques.\"\n\n\"I feel it in my soul,\" he said. \"It's not right to touch places of prayer, wherever they are.\"\n\nBut there was a message here, too, for Israel's regional military chief - scrawled in Hebrew on the mosque's exterior wall: \"We're not afraid of you, Avi Bluth.\"\n\nSpiralling settler attacks here over the past six weeks have triggered tough warnings from army leaders, along with a handful of arrests and investigations.\n\nBut hardline expansionist settlers enjoy government support, which some believe is pushing the West Bank towards a dangerous confrontation.\n\nThe annual olive harvest, when Palestinians try to access their farmland, often marks a spike in violence, but the attacks this year have broken UN records.\n\nThe UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs registered more than 260 settler attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in October alone - the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.\n\nHuman rights groups say that settler aggression towards Palestinians has risen since the Gaza War began in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks. UN figures suggest that more than 3,200 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settler violence and restrictions since then.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been several attacks across the West Bank, including an assault by a large crowd of masked men on an industrial estate and Bedouin buildings near Beit Lid. Security cameras filmed them running across the hillside and through the factory gates, where they torched several trucks.  The army said they later attacked Israeli soldiers operating nearby.\n\nThe Israel police spokesman said four suspects had been arrested. Three have reportedly since been released.\n\nLast week, in the olive groves around Beita, a Reuters journalist, Raneen Sawafta, was beaten by a settler with a club as she was covering the olive harvest - a deep dent in her helmet clearly showing the force of the blows.\n\nHamad al-Jagoub abu Rabia, a volunteer with the Red Crescent in Beita, was also injured after going to help her - hit in the head with a rock and later taken to hospital.\n\n\"I never imagined a human being created by God would do this,\" he said. \"If they had an iota of humanity, they would have never done this to a woman. If it wasn't for her helmet, she could have died.\"\n\nLess than three weeks earlier, 55-year-old Afaf Abu Alia was  badly beaten with a club  as she lay cowering on the ground during a settler attack, after picking olives on farmland she rents near the village of Abu Falah. The video of her assault drew international condemnation.\n\n\"One of [the settlers] attacked me and started beating me - hitting my head, my arms and legs, and kicking my legs with their boots,\" she told the BBC. \"I fell down. I wasn't aware of what was happening, my mind went blank - I was only feeling the pain. I felt like my soul was leaving my body. The only thing I thought about was my children.\"\n\nNow recovering at home, Afaf said she was still in pain, with 20 stitches in her head, and bruises on her arms and legs that left her unable to sleep.\n\nShe said the family had been blocked from its own farmland by settlers, and that they had been renting land elsewhere to grow olives this year.\n\n\"I'd return there today if I could, I'm not afraid of them,\" Afaf said. But she also acknowledged the situation was becoming riskier.\n\n\"They weren't like this at the start of the war,\" she said. \"In this one year, they've escalated more than in all the years before.\"\n\nOne man has been arrested in connection with her assault. Arrests like this are rare, and convictions rarer still. The Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din found that, over the past two decades, more than 93% of police investigations into Israeli offences against Palestinians in the West Bank were closed with no charges filed.\n\nIsraeli forces have long been criticised by human rights groups for standing idly by during settler attacks - or even taking part in them.\n\nThis week, Israel's chief of staff said he strongly condemned the recent violence by Israeli settlers, calling it \"a red line\" and promising to \"act decisively\".\n\nThe head of the army's central command, Maj Gen Avi Bluth - the man addressed in the graffiti on Hamida Mosque - said violent acts by what he called \"anarchist fringe youth\" were \"unacceptable and extremely serious\" and must be dealt with firmly.\n\nSome hardline settlers see these comments as a betrayal.\n\nAmichai Luria, a long-time settler from Ma'ale Levona and manager of a winery in the nearby settlement of Shiloh, told me the current focus on settler violence was overblown.\n\n\"It's amazing to me how people talk about these rare occasions [when] people misbehave,\" he said. \"Oh, some people were trying to pick olives and some Jews came and bothered them. Give me a break. There are more muggings on the main street in London than there [are] here.\"\n\nI asked him about the severe beating of women and the near-daily reports of incidents in surrounding areas. He dismissed them as an \"attempt to make the Jews look bad\".\n\n\"Most of the Arabs, if they could, would follow Hamas or Hezbollah. Very, very, very few want to coexist or live in peace, and at the first opportunity they have, they're going to wipe us out,\" he said.\n\n\"The future is very simple. Hopefully the army will wake up, hopefully people will understand that we have to prepare ourselves, that they're coming for us.\"\n\nThe UN's Office of Humanitarian Affairs says that, of the 1,000 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since the Gaza War began, between 20 and 32 were killed by Israeli settlers. During the same period, it says, Palestinians killed 19 Israeli civilians.\n\nThe decision of military leaders to order action on settler violence will test discipline in an army where settlers make up a growing proportion of troops.\n\nIt also risks exposing dangerous divisions between Israel's military and political leaders.\n\nExtremist settlers say their claim to the land comes from the Bible - but their growing confidence comes from government support.\n\nSince the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and the Gaza War that followed, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has handed out more than 100,000 weapons to civilian security squads, including in West Bank settlements, and has urged Israel to formally annex the West Bank.\n\nThe government has authorised a sharp expansion of settlements, and legalised some unauthorised outposts. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\nAnd the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, last year banned the use of administrative detention for Jewish settlers in the West Bank - reportedly against the advice of Israel's national security agency.\n\nIsrael's army is now asking Katz to reinstate that power to help curb settler violence.  Administrative detention, which allows suspects to be held for renewable six month periods without charge, is still widely used for Palestinians.\n\n\"I don't trust the army like I used to,\" Amichai Lurai told me. \"A lot of people in the army are anti-Israel from top to bottom. Trust me, the army is not unified.\"\n\nIsrael's army is currently embroiled in a legal and political scandal around  leaked video footage  allegedly showing the abuse of Palestinian detainees - a case that has pitted ultranationalist politicians against the country's security forces.\n\nAs worshippers left the Hamida Mosque after Friday prayers, Israeli activists arrived on a visit to show solidarity.  Martin Goldberg, originally from London, was one of them.\n\nI asked him about Israeli claims that attacks by settlers were overblown.\n\n\"They're very minor attacks, when it's not happening to you,\" he said. \"These attacks are not minor, they're extremely major. Everyone's trying to belittle it, [saying] oh it's just the 'weeds in the field' but it's not. And they're being supported by the government. Local councils are 100% behind them, financing them.\"\n\nMany local councils provide backing and support to outposts, but have publicly condemned the violence of some settlers there. The chairman of the West Bank Settler Council this week issued a statement supporting the Israeli army in arresting the \"anarchists\" who harmed soldiers and civilians.\n\n\"Europe, the United States, everyone in the whole world is watching the West Bank,\" said Wadi abu Awad, a civil engineer who lives in the nearby village of Turmus Aya, which has seen repeated attacks.\n\n\"We are not in a fight with the Israelis. We don't kill Israeli soldiers, we don't have any hostages. And they [settlers] are pushing us towards the corner. You know, if the cat is pushed the corner, he might become a tiger.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/briefing/trump-investigation-russia-ukraine-gifts.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"18:12:31-05:00","title":"Trump Orders Investigation Into Epstein’s Ties to Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has ordered a new Justice Department investigation into individuals with alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein, specifically targeting former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman.

Prices\n\nPublished: 2025-11-14T18:15:46-05:00\n\nThe Trump administration said on Friday that it would lift tariffs on foreign products including beef, tomatoes, bananas and coffee, an effort to alleviate some of the price pressures consumers have faced since its global levies took effect.\n\nThe exemptions were applied immediately to certain “reciprocal” tariffs that President Trump announced on other countries’ exports in April.\n\nThe White House said the tariffs were no longer needed, given the substantial progress it had made in its trade negotiations, including more than a dozen “framework deals,” final trade agreements and investment agreements. The United States said this week that it had agreed to deals with Switzerland, Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala and Uruguay that would open up those markets for U.S. business.\n\nBut the steps also appear motivated by rising concern inside and outside the White House about consumer prices. Though Mr. Trump campaigned on lowering the price of groceries, continued elevated inflation has weighed on his approval ratings, and concerns about affordability helped propel Democrats to wins in elections across the country last week.\n\nAdministration officials had publicly discussed the idea of exempting goods that do not have major domestic U.S. producers, like coffee or bananas, for countries that had signed trade agreements. But many of the exemptions announced Friday evening would apply to all “reciprocal tariffs” issued against foreign countries, not just those that have signed trade deals. The contents also appeared larger than expected, including some goods produced in the United States, like bread, beef and orange juice.\n\nSome analysts said the administration’s move was a tacit admission that tariffs had pushed up prices in the first place — a basic tenet among economists that the administration has often denied or dismissed.\n\n“Wait. If lowering tariffs lowers prices, what does raising tariffs do to prices?” Erica York, a vice president at the Tax Foundation, which has compiled estimates of the costs to consumers of the tariffs, wrote on social media.\n\nTariffs have acted with other forces to modestly boost food prices in recent months. Costs have risen more significantly for some products, like beef and coffee, the price of which has risen nearly 19 percent this year. That has been partly because of adverse weather, but tariffs of 50 percent on imports from Brazil and 20 percent on goods from Vietnam, major coffee growers, have added to the increase.\n\nU.S. inflation has remained somewhat elevated and ticked up again in recent months, despite efforts by the Federal Reverse to bring it down. The central bank recently shifted to focusing more on maintaining the health of the labor market, after a rapid slowdown in monthly jobs growth.\n\nThe Trump administration has said tariffs would supercharge U.S. investment and production, creating jobs. But many economists say tariffs have contributed to higher prices and slower economic growth, by raising costs for U.S. businesses.\n\nTariffs appear to have had a somewhat muted effect on goods prices this year, as businesses hesitated to pass costs down to their customers. But more of the cost of tariffs has been passed on to consumers in recent months. Goods inflation is on the rise, a change from last year, and prices have increased notably faster for goods that are subject to tariffs than for goods facing no levies.\n\nKarim Azzaoui, who represents an importer of hazelnuts and cashews called Balsu USA and is chairman of the board of the Association of Food Industries, said some commodities had risen so much in price that they had become unaffordable for lower-income shoppers. One example is olive oil, which has grown popular in the United States because of its health benefits.\n\n“Now that the global prices are coming down this year, we tend to see that tariffs are artificially keeping prices high here,” Mr. Azzaoui said. “We didn’t see a drop in prices at the grocery level, because an American who is buying olive oil to improve their diet will still be priced out of the market.”\n\nThe exemptions could upset some domestic producers who are in favor of tariffs and are important sources of support for Mr. Trump. Cattle ranchers have complained about the president’s effort to bring beef prices down by increasing imports, saying it runs counter to his “America First” philosophy.\n\nOther industries protested being left off the list. Chris Swonger, the chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council, said that not including European and British spirits was “another blow to the U.S. hospitality industry.” He added that spirits such as Scotch, cognac, and Irish whiskey “are value-added agricultural products that cannot be produced in the United States.”\n\nLydia DePillis contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/style/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-book-american-canto.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:45:08-05:00","title":"Olivia Nuzzi Did It All for Love","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Olivia Nuzzi, a political journalist, recounts a deep emotional and intellectual connection with Robert F.

She loved the politician, even though she was a political reporter and he was then a presidential candidate she had written about. She loved his eyes, “blue as the flame.” She loved that “the sight of something as trivial as a rose” could move him to tears. She loved his insatiable appetites and his “particular complications and particular darkness.”\n\nBut she said “I love you” only after he said it first. He called her “Livvy” and wrote her poems. He said he wanted her to have his baby. He promised to take a bullet for her.\n\nThis is what Nuzzi writes in her memoir, “American Canto,” never naming the politician who readers will deduce is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nAt the height of the 2024 presidential campaign, Nuzzi seemed to have a digital affair with Kennedy centered around texts and phone calls. The revelation derailed her career, led to her firing at New York magazine, and precipitated a very public explosion of her relationship with another prominent political journalist. Kennedy tried to brush her off, saying he had met her just once for the “hit piece” she wrote and threw his support behind Donald J. Trump, eventually becoming a cabinet secretary in his administration.\n\nNuzzi disappeared for a year, in self-imposed exile in Los Angeles where she wrote “American Canto” in secret. The book, which comes out Dec. 2 and is described here for the first time, paints a picture of a nation and a personal life on fire. She describes the mutual infatuation that consumed her, even if it was never consummated. (She is ambiguous in the book, but said in one of many interviews, “We were not sleeping together.”) But “American Canto” is far more about bearing witness to Trumpworld and about how she believes that warped her, just as it warped the country.\n\nYou could argue that referring to Kennedy and other players in the book by monikers like “the politician” is literary. It also allows her to construct a world where everyone is a sketch and proof is beside the point. Nuzzi makes clear in the book that she realizes there are people who will disagree with her version of events. She does not try to prove them. When I asked, for example, whether the text messages with Kennedy still exist, she said, “I don’t have anything to say about that.”\n\nKennedy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSitting under a pine tree in Los Angeles one night last month, Nuzzi gave up the pretense of trying to explain the unexplainable and reached for a joke for the people who simply could not fathom what came over her.\n\n“Maybe it was the vaccines.”\n\nNuzzi, 32, lives in a tiny house in the heart of Malibu where lizards crawl into her kitchen and the King James Bible and “The Divine Comedy” — two books she was reading while she was writing “American Canto” — sit on her dining room table. She drives around in a white Mustang convertible, like a Lana Del Rey song come to life.\n\nShe fled to the West Coast a year ago when the nation seemed to be “up my skirt,” as she puts it, aided by paparazzi who were determined to keep her in the news. Here she can hike in peace, though she feels hunted. Drones fly overhead; she wonders if it’s merely a coincidence.\n\nOver a decade, Nuzzi cared less about breaking news than about exposing the foibles and vanity of Trump and the people within his orbit. The president sat down with her repeatedly, despite the fact that she often did not exactly make him look good.\n\nIn the book, she describes Trump as a monster who “succeeded by making even those who said they loathed him behave sometimes quite like him.”\n\nWhy was he so willing to keep talking to her?\n\n“I certainly don’t think he’s a careful reader,” she said, sucking on a vape stick as she drove toward her “favorite rock,” off the Pacific Coast Highway. “There’s a clip once where I said something to the effect of: He loves attention, women and magazines. In that order.”\n\nNuzzi tried to convey that this comment was a joke, but she cannot entirely discount the possibility that being a woman and looking like the modern iteration of a Hitchcock blonde contributed to the access she got.\n\nShe steered the Mustang onto a patch of dirt on the side of the road and put on a black leather jacket that she pulled from the back seat. The rock she loved was at the edge of a vertiginous cliff, where water rolled and crashed.\n\n“Don’t get closer than that,” she warned, as I tried to peer over.\n\nThroughout the book, she writes of precipices, both real and metaphorical. Trump, at the top of the escalator; the distortions at the edge of a black hole; the moment before sleep when you realize you’re falling in love; the moment you’re sitting before your boss about to be confronted with “the rumors.”\n\nWhich, of course, were true.\n\nThe book — most of which she punched into her phone while hiking — is not exactly a memoir, though much of it is about her decade in journalism before she met Kennedy and her early years growing up on the Neversink River in New Jersey. Her father was a union man with the Department of Sanitation and her mother was a former catalog model who drank way too much and had what Nuzzi describes in the book as a “borderline personality gaze.”\n\nLike Trump, Nuzzi attended Fordham University. He transferred to Wharton, the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. She got an internship with Anthony Weiner’s 2013 campaign for mayor. She then wrote a piece about what a mess it was and took it to The Daily News. When the story was published, Weiner’s spokeswoman, Barbara Morgan, dismissed her to other press outlets as a “slutbag.” They are now close friends.\n\nTwo years later, at 22, she was writing full time for The Daily Beast about Trump, hitting Trump Tower during the day and reading Jimmy Breslin at night — a crash course in the school of journalism where a writer doubles as star witness. She parlayed that effort into a job at New York magazine, becoming at 24 its Washington correspondent, the first time in the magazine’s 50-year history anyone held such a post.\n\nHer pieces were filled with absurd details. In 2019, she described Rudy Giuliani showing up to an early afternoon interview with his fly unzipped and drinking Bloody Marys. In 2021, she quoted the Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and his wife talking about her after they failed to realize that they hadn’t ended their phone conversation. “We’ve got to go lock our door,” he says, seemingly fearful that Nuzzi was going to break into his campaign headquarters.\n\nAnd in 2024, just days after President Biden gave a career-ending performance at a CNN presidential debate with Trump, Nuzzi published a piece presenting the silence around Biden’s increasing frailty as a kind of “Weekend at Bernie’s”-style cover-up with national ramifications. He was so “not there,” she wrote, that “a sex scandal might help him right now.”\n\nCertain quarters of the Democratic Party were furious. A number of New York magazine’s staff members were too. They wondered if she’d gone MAGA on them. But according to Kara Swisher, whose podcast “Pivot” appears on Vox Media, New York’s parent company: “Everything she said about Biden was true. Her writing was over and beyond the best political reporting out there.”\n\n“A politician’s greatest trick is to convince you that he is not one,” Nuzzi writes in her book. “And what is a politician? Any man who wants to be loved more than other men and through his pursuit reveals why he cannot love himself.”\n\nNuzzi says in the book that her romantic entanglement — if one can refer to a digital relationship that way — with “the politician” began after she wrote about him, in an article published in November 2023.\n\nAt the time, she was engaged to the political writer Ryan Lizza. A Quinnipiac University poll had Kennedy, who was running as an Independent candidate, polling around 20 percent in a three-way hypothetical election matchup against Trump and Biden. She described riding with him around Los Angeles in his stinky mess of a van, as he drove recklessly on the road and yelled at his dogs.\n\nShe writes that the first few times Kennedy said he loved her, she did not say it back. Yet she knew she felt the same. “I love him, I thought. Oh no. I love him so much.” They spoke often and were intimate enough for her to see him flossing his teeth, his dopp kit overflowing with prescriptions.\n\nShe writes that despite being “sober” for decades, Kennedy told her that he still uses psychedelics, and even smoked dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a powerful drug on which people are known to have what feel like near-death experiences. She told him she “liked uppers. I told him that I took Adderall.”\n\nThey chose favorite parts of each other, she writes: He chose her mouth. She chose his nose. They shared a “common language, common skepticisms, common ideas about what was beautiful, common beliefs about what was valuable.” She didn’t care that he was 39 years older than her. She liked him just the way he was. They both “moved through the world with amused detachment and deep sensitivity, contradictions that worked somehow in concert.”\n\nShe describes providing him with advice about how to manage campaign issues, including the impending news that Kennedy dropped a bear carcass in Central Park.\n\nAnd when his campaign finally combusted in August 2024 and he sought an alternate path to power, she asked him how he felt visualizing himself onstage endorsing the Democratic candidate. “Nauseous,” he replied.\n\nWhen she then asked him how he would feel about endorsing the Republican candidate, his answer was the same. Yet he had the “hope” he would be able to “negotiate for influence” and the time to do so “was now.”\n\nNuzzi did not want to discuss Kennedy’s tenure as secretary of health and human services. “I don’t have any interest in offering punditry,” she said.\n\nBut in the end, she helped make sure he could get the power he sought. His alleged promise to “take a bullet” for her turned into a request that she take the bullet. She claims in the book that as news broke of their relationship in September 2024, he told her, “If it’s just sex, I can survive it.” She told him she would do whatever he needed her to do.\n\nSitting behind the wheel, shortly after Nancy Sinatra’s version of “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” played on her Spotify, she said the two are no longer in touch. “I haven’t spoken to him in a year,” she said.\n\nHow her relationship to Kennedy became public is not entirely clear, though looking back it seems inevitable, given the worlds they inhabit. Nuzzi blames Lizza, whom she had told while they were still living together.\n\nSwisher, whom Nuzzi describes in the book as a mentor, eventually found out about Kennedy and told senior leadership at New York magazine. “She just needed to come clean and she never did,” Swisher said. “It was a betrayal of the audience.”\n\nNuzzi was fired a month later, in October 2024. That same month, she filed for a protective order against Lizza, claiming that he had hacked into her devices to find damaging information about her as part of a plot to destroy her reputation. Lizza denied all of this, and Nuzzi ultimately dropped the order, saying in her motion to dismiss that Lizza had “successfully exploited the media interest in these proceedings to create an even bigger spectacle.” She still declines to present evidence that he had, in fact, done those things.\n\nIn response to questions, Lizza wrote in a text that Nuzzi had made “false and defamatory allegations” and that she “refused to defend” them.\n\nNuzzi said: “I have forgotten him. I do not wish to remember.” She declined to speak further about Lizza on the record.\n\nNuzzi and Lizza had long owed a book to Avid Reader Press that they were going to write together about the 2020 election. Someone was presumably going to have to pay back the advance they had received from Avid Reader if nothing was written.\n\nBut she says the decision to write “American Canto” was about wanting to “complete a thought” and felt a book would be the right place to do it. “I had a healthy appreciation for the fact that what had happened was not purely a tragedy.”\n\nMeanwhile, with characteristic instincts for the loci of power, she began going to San Vicente Bungalows and the Sunset Tower Hotel. It was there, last July, that she had dinner with Mark Guiducci, Vanity Fair’s new global director of editorial content. They “closed the place down,” he said, talking about the old glamour of magazines and how to reinvent that in the digital era.\n\nSoon enough, he received permission from his corporate higher-ups at Condé Nast to hire her as Vanity Fair’s new West Coast editor. It wasn’t until later that they learned she was about to land back in the news with the publication of “American Canto.”\n\nEarlier this fall, Nuzzi found out that her book was scheduled to come out within days of “Unscripted,” the new memoir from Kennedy’s wife, Cheryl Hines. Avid Reader pushed back the release of “American Canto” by three weeks with the hope that their book tours would not turn into a she said/she said.\n\nAbout the turn her life has taken, Nuzzi said there is no point in expressing wistfulness about what could or should be, rather than what is. But in the book, she describes seeing a flock of drones on Mulholland Highway and feeling “a pang of regret that I could not go out there to report.”\n\nOver the past year, she found herself interviewing strangers, and missed, she said, “relating to the world and everyone in it that way.” She still daydreamed about ways she would cover politics now.\n\nSo last week, as the New York mayoral returns came in and she sat at Mel’s Drive-In in Santa Monica, she was focused on the current mayor.\n\n“Someone has got to be covering Eric Adams tonight,” she said.\n\nWhat better way to memorialize Zohran Mamdani’s win than to capture it through the eyes of the evening’s ultimate loser, its incumbent mayor?\n\nI made a joke about how Adams had seemingly thrown away his life just to fly business class.\n\nNuzzi shrugged.\n\n“I destroyed mine for less,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-last-chance.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:48:48-05:00","title":"Football Coach Who Was Focus of Netflix’s 'Last Chance U' Is Shot","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Beam, a celebrated football coach and former athletic director at Laney College in Oakland, was gravely wounded in a shooting at the college’s athletics field house on November 13, 2025.

Shot\n\nPublished: 2025-11-13T19:48:48-05:00\n\nJohn Beam, a mainstay of the football coaching ranks in the East Bay who was profiled in the Netflix series “Last Chance U,” was gravely wounded on Thursday in a shooting at Laney College in Oakland, Calif., according to Ken Houston, a city councilman.\n\nMr. Beam, 66, is the community college’s longtime athletic director, having retired last year from more than four decades of coaching at the junior-college and high school levels.\n\nInformation about his condition was not immediately available from the authorities or the college, which said the shooting occurred around noon in the athletics field house, an 18,000-square-foot complex that includes locker rooms, team meeting rooms, a weight facility and classrooms.\n\nA motive was not given for the shooting, which prompted the Oakland Police Department to briefly lock down the campus before determining that there was no longer an active threat. The campus, in downtown Oakland, remained closed.\n\nMr. Houston said in an interview that Mr. Beam was in his office when the shooting happened. “It’s not good in Oakland right now,” he said. “He is a legend in our city.”\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday afternoon, James Beere, the city’s assistant police chief, said investigators were searching for a potential suspect, whom he described as a man wearing a black hoodie and dark clothes.\n\nIn a statement, the Peralta Community College District, which the school is part of, said the victim, a senior member of the athletic staff it did not name, was immediately taken to a local hospital.\n\n“This is a frightening moment for our community,” the statement said.\n\nBarbara Lee, a former congresswoman who is Oakland’s mayor, said in a statement on Thursday that police were investigating.\n\n“I am heartbroken by today’s shooting at Laney College — the second shooting on an Oakland campus in one week,” Ms. Lee said. “We must continue confronting the ongoing gun violence crisis that is robbing our community of safety and stealing futures.”\n\nA day earlier, a student was wounded and two juveniles were arrested in connection with a shooting at Skyline High School — where Mr. Beam once coached.\n\nRevered for his coaching style and winning on the gridiron in Oakland — first at Skyline High and later at Laney College — Mr. Beam introduced himself to television audiences on the Netflix series “Last Chance U.”\n\nDuring its fifth season in 2020, the show followed Mr. Beam and the Laney College Eagles, when his face was featured in a promotional image for the series and viewers became acquainted with Mr. Beam’s holistic approach to coaching young men, many of whom had rough upbringings.\n\nHis penchant for hugging his players and talking to them about the importance of being vulnerable was a departure from some other coaches who had been featured on the show.\n\n“To many young men, especially young men of color, showing your vulnerability is a sign of weakness,” Mr. Beam told The New York Times in 2020. “And we’re trying to say: ‘No. It’s not. In fact, it’s a sign of strength. Asking for help is a strength move, a power move.’”\n\nThe series, which offered a glimpse into the rough-and-tumble world of junior-college football, chronicled the economic plight of many of his players, who used food stamps and bunked together in studio apartments.\n\nUntil 2019, the California Community College Athletic Association barred sports programs from providing special food assistance to athletes, rules that caused Mr. Beam to bristle.\n\n“When a kid was hungry, I couldn’t go out and get him a Cup O’ Noodles — that was considered an impermissible benefit because I’m giving it to an athlete and not everybody,” Mr. Beam said.\n\nRejzohn Wright, a cornerback for the New Orleans Saints who was also featured on “Last Chance U,” was one of several of Mr. Beam’s former Laney College players to pay tribute to him on social media. On Instagram, he shared a photo of Mr. Beam placing his hands over his shoulder pads, their heads touching.\n\n“You mean the world to me,” he wrote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/nyregion/ice-detention-facility-staten-island.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"18:31:43-05:00","title":"ICE Scouted Site to Hold Immigrant Detainees in New York City","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is exploring the use of the Fort Wadsworth Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants, aiming to expand ICE’s detention capacity in New York City amid speculation of an intensified immigration crackdown following the election of Democrat Zohran Mamdani as mayor.

explored whether to use a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants, a move that could expand the federal government’s detention capacity in New York as it seeks to escalate immigration roundups in the city.\n\nLast week, officials from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency visited the Coast Guard base on Fort Wadsworth, a former military installation overlooking New York Bay, to assess the site, according to a person familiar with the visit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nTwo other people familiar with the discussions confirmed that ICE has considered the Staten Island facility.\n\nIt is unclear if ICE has determined whether the site is a suitable place to hold detainees or if the agency will proceed with the idea. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE, declined to comment.\n\nBut the search for more bed space in New York comes amid speculation that President Trump will widen his immigration crackdown in the city following the election of Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist, as mayor.\n\nThe idea of using the Coast Guard site to hold migrants for short periods quickly provoked a response from Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican from Staten Island, who said the base is ill-suited to hold detainees.\n\nHer office said that she had shared her concerns with Trump officials based on the site’s strategic importance for Coast Guard operations and significance as a historical landmark, and that she believed that ICE was disinclined to proceed.\n\n“The site is not suitable to house migrants,” Ms. Malliotakis said in a statement. “We’ve made this very clear, both publicly and privately, and we do not anticipate any such plans.”\n\nThe Coast Guard’s office in New York did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMost immigrants arrested by ICE in the city are processed at the agency’s office in Lower Manhattan, which has four short-term holding cells. Many are then transported to jails and detention facilities in New Jersey, upstate New York or Pennsylvania. There are no long-term ICE-run detention centers in New York City.\n\nCreating more bed space in New York City would allow ICE to expand its ability to hold detainees in the city before moving them to the regional airports it uses to fly detainees in the Northeast to other facilities.\n\nFort Wadsworth could make for a convenient location.\n\nThe 226-acre expanse, where the Coast Guard and U.S. Park Police have housing and offices, is a drive of about 30 minutes to or from Newark Liberty International Airport and the Manhattan ICE offices at 26 Federal Plaza. Its location on federal land, in a Republican stronghold far from more densely populated areas, could minimize citizen opposition in New York, largely a liberal city. Fort Wadsworth is one of the oldest military sites in the United States and is run by the National Park Service.\n\nBut it remains unclear whether Fort Wadsworth, the Coast Guard’s largest operational field command on the East Coast, is a feasible venue to hold migrants. The vast green space is also a recreational area, heavily used by visitors who take to the hiking and biking trails that wind through old fortifications.\n\nMs. Malliotakis, the Republican congresswoman, in 2023 opposed using Fort Wadsworth to shelter migrants. The Biden administration and state and city officials had considered opening an emergency shelter there for thousands of migrants arriving in New York City.\n\nDuring the past few months, New York’s political and civic leaders have quietly been mobilizing for the possibility that Mr. Trump may deploy the National Guard to New York, or launch a large immigration enforcement operation, as he has done in Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s victory last week further fueled those preparations, amid speculation that Mr. Trump’s plans to use Mr. Mamdani as a political foil would lead him to target New York City.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Mamdani said that he planned to call Mr. Trump before taking office in January, “because this is a relationship that will be critical to the success of the city.”\n\n“I’ll say that I’m here to work for the benefit of everyone who calls the city home, and that wherever there is a possibility for working together toward that end, I’m ready,” Mr. Mamdani told WNBC-TV. “And if it’s to the expense of those New Yorkers, I will fight it.”\n\nICE has been steadily increasing its detention capacity in the New York region this year, even before Mr. Mamdani’s rise.\n\nThe agency struck deals to hold more than 100 detainees at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal prison in Brooklyn, and up to 50 for up to 72 hours at the Nassau County jail on Long Island. It also opened a 1,000-bed facility across the Hudson River in Newark, and has contracted with at least six county jails in upstate New York.\n\nNew York City hasn’t had a large immigration detention center since ICE announced the closing of its only immigration jail in the city in 2010, citing high operational costs.\n\nThe Varick Street Detention Facility once held as many as 250 immigrants in a federal office building above a post office in Greenwich Village, unbeknown to many New Yorkers.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/weather/california-rain-flood-storm-los-angeles-forecast.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:57:49-05:00","title":"The Heaviest Rain Is Yet to Come for Southern Californians Facing a Very Wet Storm","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Southern Californians are facing an intense and dangerous storm system with heavy rainfall and the potential for flash flooding, landslides, and dangerous debris flows.

of Southern California were under evacuation warnings on Friday as an unusually strong storm system moved through the region, bringing with it a risk for flash flooding and landslides in areas recently burned by wildfires. The wet storm brought an initial soaking of rain earlier on Friday.\n\nBut the worst is yet to come. On Saturday, forecasters expect heavier rain to raise the risk of flash flooding as the system pulls in additional moisture off the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPrecipitation intensity\n\n“The atmosphere is going to be juicier on Saturday,” said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office serving the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Weather Service warned that the rain and strong winds will probably result in travel delays at airports, rockslides and mudslides on canyon roads, flooded roads, and swollen rivers and creeks. The weather could also potentially cause dangerous debris flows, a type of landslide that occurs when torrents of water and mud move down steep slopes.\n\nBurn scars are especially prone to debris flows, and some Los Angeles County residents, including those in areas that were burned during the Palisades and Eaton fires in January, were under evacuation warnings until Sunday. (A warning means that people should be prepared to leave quickly.) Some parts of Ventura County were also under evacuation warnings, including in the area burned by the Mountain fire late last year.\n\nThis system has two acts. The first occurred Thursday night into Friday afternoon, with Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties receiving a few inches of rain, and mostly light rain falling in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAct 2 is expected to be more significant. It was to begin late Friday night and continue through Saturday, when the most severe weather is forecast. That includes heavy rain and potentially thunderstorms that could cause flooding.\n\nEven on Friday morning, the exact details of Saturday’s forecast remained uncertain, as they have for much of this week. David Gomberg, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that the storm was pulling in a narrow band of moisture known as an atmospheric river off the Pacific Ocean. It was still unclear where that moisture would hit.\n\n“We think it will set up somewhere between San Bernardino County and Ventura County,” Mr. Gomberg said.\n\nIt is unusual for meteorologists to have this much uncertainty about a storm’s path. Mr. Gomberg said that as Friday progressed, the storm’s geographic range was likely to shrink, with the moisture’s target becoming clearer.\n\nPrecipitation will probably fall across all of Southern California through Sunday, with snow in the mountains at elevations above 8,000 feet and rain falling from the inland deserts to the coast. The most precipitation is expected at the coast.\n\nSanta Barbara County to Los Angeles County: Meteorologists said the highest rainfall totals were probable here, with three to four inches of rain in coastal and valley areas and four to eight inches in the mountains. Downtown Los Angeles could face three and a half to four inches of rain.\n\nThunderstorms could drop sudden bursts of especially heavy rain that would increase those totals in isolated spots, Mr. Thompson said.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the heaviest rain is predicted to start before sunrise on Saturday morning and continue throughout the day.\n\nOrange County to San Diego County: Rainfall totals are forecast to range from one and a half inches to three inches across coastal and valley areas and four to six inches in the mountains, with the highest totals likely in Orange and San Bernardino Counties and the lowest in San Diego County.\n\nSan Diego will see its heaviest rainfall early Saturday morning and in the afternoon, with the downtown area likely to record around two inches.\n\nThunderstorms could also bump up totals in some locations.\n\nCurrent areas because of fires or rain\n\nEvacuation order\n\nEvacuation warning\n\nHistorical fire perimeter\n\nSource: Cal Fire\n\nData as of Invalid Date Pacific time. Historical fire data is shown for the years 2019-2025 and is as of Nov. 13, 2025.\n\nBy William B. Davis and Joey K. Lee\n\nThe coastal mountains of Southern California, from the Santa Monica Mountains to the San Bernardino Mountains, are perfectly oriented to wring the moisture out of the atmospheric river and produce heavy rain.\n\n“The moisture will hit those mountains dead on,” said Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Those mountains act as a wall, and the water slides down the mountains and then it goes into the city.”\n\nIn one chain of events, the heavy rain pouring down the mountains and into the urban areas will cause traffic delays on roads, scattered flash flooding, and minor mudslides and debris flows.\n\nIf the system aligns over Los Angeles County on Saturday and stalls over the region for a prolonged period of time, it could cause dangerous debris flows in the burn scars from the Palisades and Eaton fires and others from recent years.\n\nBurn scars are susceptible to debris flows from heavy rain because wildfire flames have destroyed the vegetation and cooked the soil. The debris flows start as a flood that picks up sediment as it moves quickly across a hardened landscape without any vegetation to stop it.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/trump-deportations-families.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:16:26-05:00","title":"She Was Deported in Error.

She smiled at them from thousands of miles away, wiping away tears.\n\n“Chito, Chito, you cutie,” Ms. Lopez called softly to her youngest, Jorge, 2, who was propped on the lap of his brother, Milton, 23.\n\nThe toddler didn’t respond to his nickname, and gave the screen displaying his mother’s image only a fleeting glance.\n\n“Say ‘hola, mami,’” pleaded his sister, Anallely, 21.\n\nMs. Lopez has been separated from her children since early September, when federal agents raided the nutrition-bar factory where she worked in Central New York. Ms. Lopez was detained and deported to Guatemala, leaving behind her 2-year-old son.\n\nIt shouldn’t have happened.\n\nMs. Lopez was supposed to be protected from deportation because she had a pending asylum case on appeal,  after fleeing years of abuse in her home country.\n\nWith immigration agents under intense pressure to deport thousands of people each day, Ms. Lopez was pushed through the system swiftly and was deported within four days of the factory raid.\n\nAs a result, Jorge is now cared for by two siblings who are barely adults themselves.\n\nThe government returned Ms. Lopez to the United States late on Thursday because of the mistake. But she is still apart from him, held in a detention center while her asylum appeal works its way through the courts.\n\nThe case is one of a growing number of family separations that, to some, recall the policies of the first Trump administration, when children were pried from their parents’ arms soon after they crossed the southern border into the United States.\n\nThese cases, though, target immigrants who are already living in the United States.\n\nImmigration officials say parents who are being deported are given the option of bringing their U.S. born children with them as they are removed from the country.\n\nBut Ms. Lopez said she was offered no such choice.\n\nRather, her deportation was an error, email communications between her lawyers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement indicate, and the speed at which it took place appears to have separated her from her son.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said that ICE, which carries out deportations, “does not separate families.”\n\n“Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates,” she said. “This is consistent with past administrations’ immigration enforcement.”\n\nBut immigration lawyers and advocacy groups say the speed and scale at which federal agents are effecting deportations is leading to  family separations.\n\n“We are seeing a disturbing rise in cases where mothers and families are deported without their children,” said Kelly Kribs, an immigration lawyer at the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how many parents have  been deported without their children, or how many were given a choice to be deported together. Advocates say there is no national data, and the Homeland Security Department did not respond to a request for figures.\n\nDeportations involving a parent of a U.S.-born child are challenging, often forcing families to make a wrenching decision to stay together or leave their children behind, either with a family guardian or in the foster care system.\n\n“The government’s actions are creating an atmosphere where families feel they have to choose between their due process rights to protections under immigration law and the security of staying together despite not knowing if they will be safe wherever they are returned to, “ said Nan Schivone, legal director of Justice in Motion, a nonprofit that has been serving families deported to Central America.\n\nIn the raid that scooped up Ms. Lopez at Nutrition Bar Confectioners in Cato, N.Y., 57 people were detained, and 17 of them were parents, who collectively had more than 20 children, according to the Workers’ Center of Central New York, a nonprofit that advocates for low-wage workers. At least seven of the parents have already been deported, and more are expected to be expelled.\n\nIn communications reviewed by The New York Times, ICE acknowledged that Ms. Lopez was “inadvertently” removed from the United States. Ms. Lopez had the right to remain in the country because she had an active asylum appeal.\n\nHer lawyer, Elizabeth Brundige, a professor at Cornell Law School, said the removal of Ms. Lopez to Guatemala was “a clear violation of U.S. and international law.”\n\nMs. McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, contended that Ms. Lopez had “received due process” and added that “Ms. Lopez had a removal order issued by an immigration judge in 2019.”\n\nHowever, that order was stayed when Ms. Lopez filed an appeal. That is why ICE attorneys characterized Ms. Lopez’s deportation as erroneous.\n\nOfficers under pressure to boost deportation numbers are processing detainees hastily and putting them on planes without always asking parents whether they wish to take their children with them, according to lawyers who handle immigration cases.\n\n“There is complete disregard for the sanctity of family,” said Ruby Powers, an immigration lawyer in Houston.\n\nICE is not required to reunite families before deporting a parent. An agency directive dated July 2 instructs officers to help the parent arrange care for minor children, but only “to the extent operationally feasible.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions seeking clarification about how and when that would be done.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, his “zero-tolerance” policy took thousands of migrant children away from their parents at the border. After  drawing national outrage, the policy was rescinded.\n\nNow, when parents are separated from their children by immigration authorities, it is happening quickly and quietly.\n\n“These new separations are a response to the enormous pressure to deliver unrealistic deportation numbers — far from the public eye,” said Mary Giovagnoli, an immigration lawyer and policy expert.\n\nMs. Lopez was halfway through her 4 a.m.-to-12:30 p.m. shift at the nutrition-bar plant on Sept. 4 when a command crackled over the building’s public address system: “All workers report to the lunchroom.”\n\nMs. Lopez, 41, complied, still wearing her white lab coat, hairnet and face mask.\n\nInside her purse, she said, were her work permit, Social Security card and a letter from her lawyer on Cornell Law School stationery stating that Ms. Lopez had a pending asylum appeal and was “lawfully in the United States and cannot be removed.”\n\nMoments later, armed agents began separating the workers into two groups — U.S. citizens and immigrants. Ms. Lopez showed an agent her valid work permit, and was initially placed with the citizens. But another agent ordered her to join the other group.\n\nShe called her children and her lawyer, Ms. Brundige, who recalled telling her, “Make sure and give them all your documents, and see if they will talk to me.”\n\nInstead, an agent seized her phone and switched it to airplane mode, Ms. Lopez said. Her wrists were bound, she said, and she was loaded into a van with other women.\n\nAt a Border Patrol station in nearby Oswego, N.Y., officers tapped each worker’s name into a computer. Ms. Lopez saw her entire immigration history pop up, and she handed over her documents, including the Cornell letter.\n\nMs. Lopez also produced her toddler’s Social Security card.\n\n“He’s two years old,” she said she told the officer. “He needs me.”\n\nBy the next morning, Ms. Lopez was in Texas. Two days later, she was on a plane to Guatemala.\n\nBack home, her son, Jorge, cried for her, “Mami, Mami,” said his sister.\n\nMs. Lopez was referred to Cornell’s legal clinic in 2018, shortly after she arrived in New York with her two older children.\n\n“From the start, we could tell she had a very strong case for asylum, based on the horrendous abuse she experienced, which constituted persecution,” Ms. Brundige said. And under the Convention Against Torture, people cannot legally be returned to a country where they face the risk of torture, she said.\n\nMedical and police reports, as well as testimonials from family members that are attached to Ms. Lopez’s 44-page asylum court filing detail how she endured brutal, unrelenting abuse for years from her partner, the father of her two older children. He lashed her with belts, hurled glass at her and threatened to stab her, the documents say; he once hacked through a door with a machete, and then choked and struck her.\n\nShe filed police report after police report, to no avail. Restraining orders she was granted were not enforced.\n\nEven her religious faith provoked her partner’s rage, the documents say. Attending mass earned her beatings. So did voting in local elections.\n\nFearing for their lives, Ms. Lopez fled with her children and surrendered to American authorities at the U.S.-Mexican border in Texas in March 2018. A few weeks later, they were released with a notice to appear in court, and headed to rural New York, where a friend had told Ms. Lopez there was work.\n\nShe got a job at a dairy farm near Rome, attended church and enrolled in English classes.\n\n“I lived well with my children,” she said in an interview from Guatemala, while in hiding at the home of a relative. In the United States, she said, “I felt safe. I wasn’t afraid of anything.”\n\nAt Cornell, law students and professors began building her case.\n\nIn January 2019, the team filed her application for asylum.\n\nAt a hearing in November 2019, Ms. Lopez testified before an immigration judge for four hours, recounting years of assault, beatings and other violence.\n\nDuring cross-examination, a government lawyer pressed Ms. Lopez on the timing and sequence of events and her interactions with law enforcement, questions that were challenging for both the court-appointed interpreter and Ms. Lopez to follow, her lawyer said.\n\nThe judge denied her asylum claim on credibility grounds, citing inconsistencies in her account. Her lawyers appealed, and her case remains pending.\n\nBy 2021, Ms. Lopez had moved to Fulton, 30 minutes from Syracuse, where she worked on the wrapping line at the nutrition-bar factory.\n\nIn early 2023, Ms. Lopez discovered that she had an unplanned pregnancy. The father, who was undocumented, soon moved away and could not help raise the child. Ms. Lopez, with the support of her older children, chose to keep the baby.\n\nJorge was born on Sept. 3, 2023. “He’s a blessing,” she said.\n\nThe day after his second birthday, agents raided her workplace.\n\n“Our expectation was that once she was able to explain her situation, immigration authorities would understand and release her,” Ms. Brundige said.\n\nInstead,Ms. Lopez found herself calling her children from a border facility in McAllen, Texas.\n\nShackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, Ms. Lopez was put on a plane in the early hours of Tuesday, Sept. 7.\n\n“I was crying for my children, praying that God would protect them,” Ms. Lopez said.\n\nThe next time she spoke to her children, she was in Guatemala.\n\nMs. Lopez’s Cornell lawyers fired off emails to ICE lawyers in Buffalo. On Sept. 8, the ICE lawyers responded that they had no record of her removal, according to correspondence reviewed by The Times.\n\nThe admission came a week later: A Sept. 15 email said Ms. Lopez had been arrested by Customs and Border Protection on Sept. 3 and “inadvertently removed” four days later.\n\nAn ICE field office director said in an email on Sept. 22 that he would start the process to allow Ms. Lopez to return to the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Lopez received an unexpected call from an official at the American embassy in Guatemala City, informing her that she would be flown back to the United States the next day.\n\nShe will remain detained until her immigration case is decided.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/dog-shoots-owner-pennsylvania.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:03:01-05:00","title":"Dog Accidentally Shoots and Injures a Pennsylvania Man, Police Say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 53-year-old man in Shillington, Pennsylvania, was accidentally shot in the back when a dog jumped onto the bed while he was cleaning a shotgun, causing it to discharge.

2025-11-14T17:50:47-05:00\n\nThe Sunset District in San Francisco had long been considered a sleepy neighborhood of single-family homes abutting the Pacific Ocean until it became embroiled in political wars the past couple of years.\n\nResidents fought over turning a roadway into a park. They battled over whether to allow denser housing construction. And they feuded over whether to recall their supervisor, Joel Engardio, over those issues, ultimately deciding to oust him in September.\n\nNow, they have finally found something to agree on: Mayor Daniel Lurie made a huge error when he appointed a replacement supervisor who has resigned after just seven days in office.\n\nA week after Mr. Lurie appointed a political neophyte, Beya Alcaraz, 29, to represent the Sunset District on the Board of Supervisors, she stepped down Thursday night amid a host of allegations about her past business practices.\n\nShe was accused of leaving a pet store that she owned in the Sunset District in shambles, and suggested in text messages that she had cheated on her taxes. She could not be reached Friday for comment.\n\nIt was considered the biggest misstep of Mr. Lurie’s 10-month tenure. The embarrassing resignation left constituents and political leaders wondering how he could have appointed someone so inexperienced without a more thorough vetting.\n\n“Mayor Lurie is finally uniting people,” said John Crabtree, a Sunset District resident who volunteered on the recall campaign. “There is agreement that this thing, this last week, was B.S.”\n\nThe Sunset District saga has roots in the Great Highway, a two-mile stretch of roadway lining Ocean Beach that was closed to cars during the coronavirus pandemic to give people space to exercise while remaining socially distanced.\n\nAs the pandemic waned, the city struck a compromise to reopen the road to cars during the week and use it as a park on the weekends.\n\nThe district elected Mr. Engardio in 2022 to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, akin to a city council, largely because he was instrumental in recalling three school board members and supported the ouster of a progressive district attorney whom the politically moderate district did not like.\n\nIt did not take long for the district to turn on Mr. Engardio and recall him, too. Sunset voters were angry that he didn’t consult them when he championed a citywide ballot measure that permanently closed the Great Highway to cars. They were also upset that he backed a plan by Mr. Lurie to allow bigger apartment buildings in the neighborhood.\n\nThat left Mr. Lurie with the job of finding a replacement who would satisfy the neighborhood on the Great Highway issue and support his housing plan — a rare combination. He found such a person in Ms. Alcaraz, a political unknown who approached him at a street festival shortly after the recall of Mr. Engardio and told him that she wanted the job and gave him her phone number.\n\nThe mayor’s office says that it paid a private firm to vet Ms. Alcaraz. The firm did tell the mayor’s office that there might have been issues with the Animal Connection, a neighborhood pet store Ms. Alcaraz transferred to a new owner in May, for no money, but it did not unearth the tax issues.\n\nJulia Baran, the new owner of the Animal Connection, said in an interview on Friday that nobody from the Lurie administration called her or visited the pet store during their vetting process.\n\nIf they had, she said, they would have learned that Ms. Alcaraz left behind a freezer stuffed with pet corpses. Furthermore, she said, the store was covered in urine and feces and short on inventory.\n\n“I’m very familiar with the smell of death now,” she said.\n\nMs. Baran, irate over the mayor’s appointment of Ms. Alcaraz, took her story to several local media outlets. She also shared screen shots of text exchanges, first reported by Mission Local, in which Ms. Alcaraz wrote that she paid her employees under the table and that she wrote off dinners and drinks with friends as business expenses.\n\n“They may or may not pay me back in cash,” she wrote next to a smiley face emoji.\n\nMs. Baran said that she had no idea what the mayor saw in Ms. Alcaraz.\n\n“It’s irresponsible and concerning and it really makes me question his capabilities,” she said. “The truth matters.”\n\nMr. Lurie said on Thursday night that he thought that Ms. Alcaraz could heal “a divided community.”\n\nBut he added that he had not learned about “the new information about her conduct while running her small business” until earlier that day, and that the two agreed that she should resign.\n\nLucas Lux, who lives a block from Ocean Beach and led the effort to convert the Great Highway into a park called Sunset Dunes, said it had been a wild week.\n\n“Like everyone else in the city, my head is spinning,” he said. “I’m enjoying the show, I guess.”\n\nMr. Lurie has enjoyed high approval ratings so far after serving as the city’s top cheerleader in Instagram posts and fending off a plan from President Trump to send Border Patrol agents to the city last month. He has prided himself on focusing on local quality of life matters and avoiding national politics — at least when he can.\n\nBut the Sunset shenanigans have left some San Franciscans wondering how much longer the mayor’s honeymoon period has left.\n\n“He’s gotten himself into a bit of a political pretzel,” Mr. Lux observed.\n\nRafael Mandelman, the president of the Board of Supervisors, said that Mr. Lurie needed to work harder to find a top-notch Sunset supervisor this time around. He noted that the appointee would have to rebuild trust and satisfy constituents enough to get elected, all while supporting Mr. Lurie’s agenda.\n\n“It’s a very, very tall order,” Mr. Mandelman said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/disney-youtube-tv-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"21:16:52-05:00","title":"Disney and YouTube TV End Blackout","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney and YouTube TV have resolved a 15-day blackout that prevented YouTube TV subscribers from accessing key channels such as ESPN, ABC, 'Monday Night Football,' 'Bluey,' 'Good Morning America,' 'Dancing With the Stars,' and '9-1-1: Nashville' due to disputes over carriage fees.

to return to the Google-owned pay-television service, the companies said on Friday.\n\nThe deal ends a 15-day blackout that prevented YouTube TV’s estimated 10 million customers from viewing programs like “Monday Night Football,” “Bluey,” “Good Morning America,” “Dancing With the Stars” and “9-1-1: Nashville” as the two sides haggled over terms of a new distribution agreement. Those terms, including the exact length of the agreement, were not disclosed.\n\nThe pact was struck in time to avoid alienating viewers who wanted to watch a major Saturday slate of college football, including national draws like Notre Dame and Alabama facing ranked opponents. The popular Dallas Cowboys are scheduled to play on Monday night. As part of the deal, YouTube TV subscribers will receive unlimited access to ESPN’s new flagship streaming service at no additional cost. (Stand-alone subscriptions to the ESPN app run $30 month.)\n\n“We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf,” YouTube TV said in a statement. The company added that Disney-owned channels would return immediately, along with any recordings that subscribers had saved in their libraries.\n\nDisney said in a separate statement that the deal “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.” The statement was attributed to the senior executives Dana Walden, Jimmy Pitaro and Alan Bergman.\n\nThe blackout hurt both sides.\n\nDisney lost $4.3 million a day during the standoff, according to a Morgan Stanley estimate, which took into account viewership declines. (Still, Hugh Johnston, Disney’s chief financial officer, had said in a CNBC interview on Thursday that his company was ready to continue fighting YouTube TV for “as long as they want.”)\n\nYouTube TV offered customers a $20 credit, but many angry customers dropped the service anyway.\n\nThe two media giants had clashed over fees. Disney wanted YouTube TV to pay more for access to ESPN and other channels, in part to offset higher costs for sports rights. YouTube TV balked, saying the proposed terms would force it to raise prices.\n\nThese so-called carriage disputes are not uncommon in the television business, which has been roiled by streaming over the past decade. But the spat between Disney and YouTube grew particularly acrimonious.\n\nDisney publicly accused YouTube TV of using its clout “to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor.” YouTube fired back, accusing Disney of maneuvering to prop up competing pay-television services — notably Hulu + Live TV and Fubo, both of which Disney owns.\n\n"}]}
